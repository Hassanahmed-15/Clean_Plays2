ACT 1 SCENE 1

1: ANTONIO: In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
2: It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
3: But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
4: What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
5: I am to learn;
6: And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
7: That I have much ado to know myself.
8: SALARINO: Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
9: There, where your argosies with portly sail,
10: Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
11: Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,
12: Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
13: That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
14: As they fly by them with their woven wings.
15: SALANIO: Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
16: The better part of my affections would
17: Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
18: Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
19: Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
20: And every object that might make me fear
21: Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
22: Would make me sad.
23: SALARINO: My wind cooling my broth
24: Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
25: What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
26: I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,
27: But I should think of shallows and of flats,
28: And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
29: Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
30: To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
31: And see the holy edifice of stone,
32: And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
33: Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,
34: Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
35: Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
36: And, in a word, but even now worth this,
37: And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
38: To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
39: That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
40: But tell not me; I know, Antonio
41: Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
42: ANTONIO: Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
43: My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
44: Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
45: Upon the fortune of this present year:
46: Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
47: SALARINO: Why, then you are in love.
48: ANTONIO: Fie, fie!
49: SALARINO: Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,
50: Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
51: For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
52: Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
53: Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
54: Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
55: And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,
56: And other of such vinegar aspect
57: That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,
58: Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
59: SALANIO: Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
60: Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:
61: We leave you now with better company.
62: SALARINO: I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,
63: If worthier friends had not prevented me.
64: ANTONIO: Your worth is very dear in my regard.
65: I take it, your own business calls on you
66: And you embrace the occasion to depart.
67: SALARINO: Good morrow, my good lords.
68: BASSANIO: Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?
69: You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?
70: SALARINO: We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
71: LORENZO: My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
72: We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,
73: I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.
74: BASSANIO: I will not fail you.
75: GRATIANO: You look not well, Signior Antonio;
76: You have too much respect upon the world:
77: They lose it that do buy it with much care:
78: Believe me, you are marvellously changed.
79: ANTONIO: I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
80: A stage where every man must play a part,
81: And mine a sad one.
82: GRATIANO: Let me play the fool:
83: With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,
84: And let my liver rather heat with wine
85: Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
86: Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,
87: Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
88: Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
89: By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--
90: I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--
91: There are a sort of men whose visages
92: Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
93: And do a wilful stillness entertain,
94: With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
95: Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
96: As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,
97: And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'
98: O my Antonio, I do know of these
99: That therefore only are reputed wise
100: For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,
101: If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,
102: Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
103: I'll tell thee more of this another time:
104: But fish not, with this melancholy bait,
105: For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.
106: Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:
107: I'll end my exhortation after dinner.
108: LORENZO: Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:
109: I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
110: For Gratiano never lets me speak.
111: GRATIANO: Well, keep me company but two years moe,
112: Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
113: ANTONIO: Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.
114: GRATIANO: Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
115: In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.
116: ANTONIO: Is that any thing now?
117: BASSANIO: Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more
118: than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two
119: grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you
120: shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you
121: have them, they are not worth the search.
122: ANTONIO: Well, tell me now what lady is the same
123: To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,
124: That you to-day promised to tell me of?
125: BASSANIO: 'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
126: How much I have disabled mine estate,
127: By something showing a more swelling port
128: Than my faint means would grant continuance:
129: Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
130: From such a noble rate; but my chief care
131: Is to come fairly off from the great debts
132: Wherein my time something too prodigal
133: Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,
134: I owe the most, in money and in love,
135: And from your love I have a warranty
136: To unburden all my plots and purposes
137: How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
138: ANTONIO: I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
139: And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
140: Within the eye of honour, be assured,
141: My purse, my person, my extremest means,
142: Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.
143: BASSANIO: In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
144: I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
145: The self-same way with more advised watch,
146: To find the other forth, and by adventuring both
147: I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
148: Because what follows is pure innocence.
149: I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,
150: That which I owe is lost; but if you please
151: To shoot another arrow that self way
152: Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
153: As I will watch the aim, or to find both
154: Or bring your latter hazard back again
155: And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
156: ANTONIO: You know me well, and herein spend but time
157: To wind about my love with circumstance;
158: And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
159: In making question of my uttermost
160: Than if you had made waste of all I have:
161: Then do but say to me what I should do
162: That in your knowledge may by me be done,
163: And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.
164: BASSANIO: In Belmont is a lady richly left;
165: And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
166: Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
167: I did receive fair speechless messages:
168: Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
169: To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:
170: Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
171: For the four winds blow in from every coast
172: Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
173: Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
174: Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,
175: And many Jasons come in quest of her.
176: O my Antonio, had I but the means
177: To hold a rival place with one of them,
178: I have a mind presages me such thrift,
179: That I should questionless be fortunate!
180: ANTONIO: Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
181: Neither have I money nor commodity
182: To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;
183: Try what my credit can in Venice do:
184: That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,
185: To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
186: Go, presently inquire, and so will I,
187: Where money is, and I no question make
188: To have it of my trust or for my sake.
ACT 1 SCENE 2

1: PORTIA: By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of
2: this great world.
3: NERISSA: You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in
4: the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and
5: yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit
6: with too much as they that starve with nothing. It
7: is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the
8: mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but
9: competency lives longer.
10: PORTIA: Good sentences and well pronounced.
11: NERISSA: They would be better, if well followed.
12: PORTIA: If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
13: do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
14: cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that
15: follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
16: twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the
17: twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
18: devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps
19: o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
20: youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the
21: cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
22: choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may
23: neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
24: dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed
25: by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,
26: Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?
27: NERISSA: Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their
28: death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,
29: that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,
30: silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning
31: chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any
32: rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what
33: warmth is there in your affection towards any of
34: these princely suitors that are already come?
35: PORTIA: I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest
36: them, I will describe them; and, according to my
37: description, level at my affection.
38: NERISSA: First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
39: PORTIA: Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but
40: talk of his horse; and he makes it a great
41: appropriation to his own good parts, that he can
42: shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his
43: mother played false with a smith.
44: NERISSA: Then there is the County Palatine.
45: PORTIA: He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you
46: will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and
47: smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping
48: philosopher when he grows old, being so full of
49: unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be
50: married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth
51: than to either of these. God defend me from these
52: two!
53: NERISSA: How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
54: PORTIA: God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.
55: In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,
56: he! why, he hath a horse better than the
57: Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than
58: the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a
59: throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will
60: fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I
61: should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me
62: I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I
63: shall never requite him.
64: NERISSA: What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron
65: of England?
66: PORTIA: You know I say nothing to him, for he understands
67: not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,
68: nor Italian, and you will come into the court and
69: swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.
70: He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can
71: converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!
72: I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round
73: hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his
74: behavior every where.
75: NERISSA: What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?
76: PORTIA: That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he
77: borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
78: swore he would pay him again when he was able: I
79: think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
80: under for another.
81: NERISSA: How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?
82: PORTIA: Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and
83: most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when
84: he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and
85: when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:
86: and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall
87: make shift to go without him.
88: NERISSA: If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
89: casket, you should refuse to perform your father's
90: will, if you should refuse to accept him.
91: PORTIA: Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a
92: deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,
93: for if the devil be within and that temptation
94: without, I know he will choose it. I will do any
95: thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.
96: NERISSA: You need not fear, lady, the having any of these
97: lords: they have acquainted me with their
98: determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their
99: home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless
100: you may be won by some other sort than your father's
101: imposition depending on the caskets.
102: PORTIA: If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as
103: chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner
104: of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers
105: are so reasonable, for there is not one among them
106: but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant
107: them a fair departure.
108: NERISSA: Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
109: Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither
110: in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?
111: PORTIA: Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.
112: NERISSA: True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish
113: eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
114: PORTIA: I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of
115: thy praise.
116: How now! what news?
117: Servant: The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take
118: their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a
119: fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the
120: prince his master will be here to-night.
121: PORTIA: If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
122: heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should
123: be glad of his approach: if he have the condition
124: of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had
125: rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
126: Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.
127: Whiles we shut the gates
128: upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.
ACT 1 SCENE 3

1: SHYLOCK: Three thousand ducats; well.
2: BASSANIO: Ay, sir, for three months.
3: SHYLOCK: For three months; well.
4: BASSANIO: For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
5: SHYLOCK: Antonio shall become bound; well.
6: BASSANIO: May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I
7: know your answer?
8: SHYLOCK: Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.
9: BASSANIO: Your answer to that.
10: SHYLOCK: Antonio is a good man.
11: BASSANIO: Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
12: SHYLOCK: Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a
13: good man is to have you understand me that he is
14: sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he
15: hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the
16: Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he
17: hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and
18: other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships
19: are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats
20: and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I
21: mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,
22: winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,
23: sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may
24: take his bond.
25: BASSANIO: Be assured you may.
26: SHYLOCK: I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,
27: I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?
28: BASSANIO: If it please you to dine with us.
29: SHYLOCK: Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which
30: your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I
31: will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,
32: walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat
33: with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What
34: news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?
35: BASSANIO: This is Signior Antonio.
36: SHYLOCK: [Aside] How like a fawning publican he looks!
37: I hate him for he is a Christian,
38: But more for that in low simplicity
39: He lends out money gratis and brings down
40: The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
41: If I can catch him once upon the hip,
42: I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
43: He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,
44: Even there where merchants most do congregate,
45: On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
46: Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,
47: If I forgive him!
48: BASSANIO: Shylock, do you hear?
49: SHYLOCK: I am debating of my present store,
50: And, by the near guess of my memory,
51: I cannot instantly raise up the gross
52: Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
53: Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
54: Will furnish me. But soft! how many months
55: Do you desire?
56: Rest you fair, good signior;
57: Your worship was the last man in our mouths.
58: ANTONIO: Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow
59: By taking nor by giving of excess,
60: Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
61: I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd
62: How much ye would?
63: SHYLOCK: Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
64: ANTONIO: And for three months.
65: SHYLOCK: I had forgot; three months; you told me so.
66: Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;
67: Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
68: Upon advantage.
69: ANTONIO: I do never use it.
70: SHYLOCK: When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--
71: This Jacob from our holy Abram was,
72: As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,
73: The third possessor; ay, he was the third--
74: ANTONIO: And what of him? did he take interest?
75: SHYLOCK: No, not take interest, not, as you would say,
76: Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
77: When Laban and himself were compromised
78: That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
79: Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,
80: In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
81: And, when the work of generation was
82: Between these woolly breeders in the act,
83: The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,
84: And, in the doing of the deed of kind,
85: He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
86: Who then conceiving did in eaning time
87: Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.
88: This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:
89: And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.
90: ANTONIO: This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;
91: A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
92: But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
93: Was this inserted to make interest good?
94: Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
95: SHYLOCK: I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:
96: But note me, signior.
97: ANTONIO: Mark you this, Bassanio,
98: The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
99: An evil soul producing holy witness
100: Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
101: A goodly apple rotten at the heart:
102: O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
103: SHYLOCK: Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.
104: Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate--
105: ANTONIO: Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
106: SHYLOCK: Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
107: In the Rialto you have rated me
108: About my moneys and my usances:
109: Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,
110: For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
111: You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
112: And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,
113: And all for use of that which is mine own.
114: Well then, it now appears you need my help:
115: Go to, then; you come to me, and you say
116: 'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;
117: You, that did void your rheum upon my beard
118: And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
119: Over your threshold: moneys is your suit
120: What should I say to you? Should I not say
121: 'Hath a dog money? is it possible
122: A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
123: Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,
124: With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;
125: 'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;
126: You spurn'd me such a day; another time
127: You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies
128: I'll lend you thus much moneys'?
129: ANTONIO: I am as like to call thee so again,
130: To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
131: If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
132: As to thy friends; for when did friendship take
133: A breed for barren metal of his friend?
134: But lend it rather to thine enemy,
135: Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face
136: Exact the penalty.
137: SHYLOCK: Why, look you, how you storm!
138: I would be friends with you and have your love,
139: Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,
140: Supply your present wants and take no doit
141: Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:
142: This is kind I offer.
143: BASSANIO: This were kindness.
144: SHYLOCK: This kindness will I show.
145: Go with me to a notary, seal me there
146: Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,
147: If you repay me not on such a day,
148: In such a place, such sum or sums as are
149: Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit
150: Be nominated for an equal pound
151: Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken
152: In what part of your body pleaseth me.
153: ANTONIO: Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond
154: And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
155: BASSANIO: You shall not seal to such a bond for me:
156: I'll rather dwell in my necessity.
157: ANTONIO: Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:
158: Within these two months, that's a month before
159: This bond expires, I do expect return
160: Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
161: SHYLOCK: O father Abram, what these Christians are,
162: Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
163: The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;
164: If he should break his day, what should I gain
165: By the exaction of the forfeiture?
166: A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
167: Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
168: As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,
169: To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:
170: If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
171: And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.
172: ANTONIO: Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
173: SHYLOCK: Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
174: Give him direction for this merry bond,
175: And I will go and purse the ducats straight,
176: See to my house, left in the fearful guard
177: Of an unthrifty knave, and presently
178: I will be with you.
179: ANTONIO: Hie thee, gentle Jew.
180: The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.
181: BASSANIO: I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.
ACT 2 SCENE 1

1: MOROCCO: Mislike me not for my complexion,
2: The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,
3: To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.
4: Bring me the fairest creature northward born,
5: Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,
6: And let us make incision for your love,
7: To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
8: I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine
9: Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear
10: The best-regarded virgins of our clime
11: Have loved it too: I would not change this hue,
12: Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
13: PORTIA: In terms of choice I am not solely led
14: By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;
15: Besides, the lottery of my destiny
16: Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:
17: But if my father had not scanted me
18: And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself
19: His wife who wins me by that means I told you,
20: Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair
21: As any comer I have look'd on yet
22: For my affection.
23: MOROCCO: Even for that I thank you:
24: Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets
25: To try my fortune. By this scimitar
26: That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince
27: That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,
28: I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,
29: Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
30: Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,
31: Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,
32: To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!
33: If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
34: Which is the better man, the greater throw
35: May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:
36: So is Alcides beaten by his page;
37: And so may I, blind fortune leading me,
38: Miss that which one unworthier may attain,
39: And die with grieving.
40: PORTIA: You must take your chance,
41: And either not attempt to choose at all
42: Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong
43: Never to speak to lady afterward
44: In way of marriage: therefore be advised.
45: MOROCCO: Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
46: PORTIA: First, forward to the temple: after dinner
47: Your hazard shall be made.
48: MOROCCO: Good fortune then!
49: To make me blest or cursed'st among men.
ACT 2 SCENE 2

1: LAUNCELOT: Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from
2: this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and
3: tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good
4: Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot
5: Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My
6: conscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;
7: take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honest
8: Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy
9: heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me
10: pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the
11: fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'
12: says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,
13: hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely
14: to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest
15: man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for,
16: indeed, my father did something smack, something
17: grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience
18: says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the
19: fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.
20: 'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'
21: say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my
22: conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master,
23: who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, to
24: run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the
25: fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil
26: himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil
27: incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is
28: but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel
29: me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more
30: friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are
31: at your command; I will run.
32: GOBBO: Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way
33: to master Jew's?
34: LAUNCELOT: [Aside] O heavens, this is my true-begotten father!
35: who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind,
36: knows me not: I will try confusions with him.
37: GOBBO: Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way
38: to master Jew's?
39: LAUNCELOT: Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but,
40: at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at
41: the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn
42: down indirectly to the Jew's house.
43: GOBBO: By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit. Can
44: you tell me whether one Launcelot,
45: that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?
46: LAUNCELOT: Talk you of young Master Launcelot?
47: Mark me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk you
48: of young Master Launcelot?
49: GOBBO: No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father,
50: though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor man
51: and, God be thanked, well to live.
52: LAUNCELOT: Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk of
53: young Master Launcelot.
54: GOBBO: Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir.
55: LAUNCELOT: But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,
56: talk you of young Master Launcelot?
57: GOBBO: Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.
58: LAUNCELOT: Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master
59: Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman,
60: according to Fates and Destinies and such odd
61: sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of
62: learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would say
63: in plain terms, gone to heaven.
64: GOBBO: Marry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of my
65: age, my very prop.
66: LAUNCELOT: Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or
67: a prop? Do you know me, father?
68: GOBBO: Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman:
69: but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his
70: soul, alive or dead?
71: LAUNCELOT: Do you not know me, father?
72: GOBBO: Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.
73: LAUNCELOT: Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of
74: the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his
75: own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of
76: your son: give me your blessing: truth will come
77: to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son
78: may, but at the length truth will out.
79: GOBBO: Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are not
80: Launcelot, my boy.
81: LAUNCELOT: Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but
82: give me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boy
83: that was, your son that is, your child that shall
84: be.
85: GOBBO: I cannot think you are my son.
86: LAUNCELOT: I know not what I shall think of that: but I am
87: Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your
88: wife is my mother.
89: GOBBO: Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thou
90: be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.
91: Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou
92: got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than
93: Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.
94: LAUNCELOT: It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows
95: backward: I am sure he had more hair of his tail
96: than I have of my face when I last saw him.
97: GOBBO: Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy
98: master agree? I have brought him a present. How
99: 'gree you now?
100: LAUNCELOT: Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have set
101: up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I
102: have run some ground. My master's a very Jew: give
103: him a present! give him a halter: I am famished in
104: his service; you may tell every finger I have with
105: my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give me
106: your present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed,
107: gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, I
108: will run as far as God has any ground. O rare
109: fortune! here comes the man: to him, father; for I
110: am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.
111: BASSANIO: You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper
112: be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See
113: these letters delivered; put the liveries to making,
114: and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.
115: LAUNCELOT: To him, father.
116: GOBBO: God bless your worship!
117: BASSANIO: Gramercy! wouldst thou aught with me?
118: GOBBO: Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,--
119: LAUNCELOT: Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man; that
120: would, sir, as my father shall specify--
121: GOBBO: He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve--
122: LAUNCELOT: Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew,
123: and have a desire, as my father shall specify--
124: GOBBO: His master and he, saving your worship's reverence,
125: are scarce cater-cousins--
126: LAUNCELOT: To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having
127: done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being, I
128: hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you--
129: GOBBO: I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon
130: your worship, and my suit is--
131: LAUNCELOT: In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as
132: your worship shall know by this honest old man; and,
133: though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.
134: BASSANIO: One speak for both. What would you?
135: LAUNCELOT: Serve you, sir.
136: GOBBO: That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
137: BASSANIO: I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:
138: Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,
139: And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment
140: To leave a rich Jew's service, to become
141: The follower of so poor a gentleman.
142: LAUNCELOT: The old proverb is very well parted between my
143: master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of
144: God, sir, and he hath enough.
145: BASSANIO: Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.
146: Take leave of thy old master and inquire
147: My lodging out. Give him a livery
148: More guarded than his fellows': see it done.
149: LAUNCELOT: Father, in. I cannot get a service, no; I have
150: ne'er a tongue in my head. Well, if any man in
151: Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear
152: upon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to,
153: here's a simple line of life: here's a small trifle
154: of wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing! eleven
155: widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one
156: man: and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to be
157: in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;
158: here are simple scapes. Well, if Fortune be a
159: woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,
160: come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.
161: BASSANIO: I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this:
162: These things being bought and orderly bestow'd,
163: Return in haste, for I do feast to-night
164: My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go.
165: LEONARDO: My best endeavours shall be done herein.
166: GRATIANO: Where is your master?
167: LEONARDO: Yonder, sir, he walks.
168: GRATIANO: Signior Bassanio!
169: BASSANIO: Gratiano!
170: GRATIANO: I have a suit to you.
171: BASSANIO: You have obtain'd it.
172: GRATIANO: You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.
173: BASSANIO: Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano;
174: Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;
175: Parts that become thee happily enough
176: And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;
177: But where thou art not known, why, there they show
178: Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain
179: To allay with some cold drops of modesty
180: Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior
181: I be misconstrued in the place I go to,
182: And lose my hopes.
183: GRATIANO: Signior Bassanio, hear me:
184: If I do not put on a sober habit,
185: Talk with respect and swear but now and then,
186: Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,
187: Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes
188: Thus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,'
189: Use all the observance of civility,
190: Like one well studied in a sad ostent
191: To please his grandam, never trust me more.
192: BASSANIO: Well, we shall see your bearing.
193: GRATIANO: Nay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge me
194: By what we do to-night.
195: BASSANIO: No, that were pity:
196: I would entreat you rather to put on
197: Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends
198: That purpose merriment. But fare you well:
199: I have some business.
200: GRATIANO: And I must to Lorenzo and the rest:
201: But we will visit you at supper-time.
ACT 2 SCENE 3

1: JESSICA: I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:
2: Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,
3: Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
4: But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee:
5: And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see
6: Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest:
7: Give him this letter; do it secretly;
8: And so farewell: I would not have my father
9: See me in talk with thee.
10: LAUNCELOT: Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful
11: pagan, most sweet Jew! if a Christian did not play
12: the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But,
13: adieu: these foolish drops do something drown my
14: manly spirit: adieu.
15: JESSICA: Farewell, good Launcelot.
16: Alack, what heinous sin is it in me
17: To be ashamed to be my father's child!
18: But though I am a daughter to his blood,
19: I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,
20: If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,
21: Become a Christian and thy loving wife.
ACT 2 SCENE 4

1: LORENZO: Nay, we will slink away in supper-time,
2: Disguise us at my lodging and return,
3: All in an hour.
4: GRATIANO: We have not made good preparation.
5: SALARINO: We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.
6: SALANIO: 'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd,
7: And better in my mind not undertook.
8: LORENZO: 'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours
9: To furnish us.
10: Friend Launcelot, what's the news?
11: LAUNCELOT: An it shall please you to break up
12: this, it shall seem to signify.
13: LORENZO: I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand;
14: And whiter than the paper it writ on
15: Is the fair hand that writ.
16: GRATIANO: Love-news, in faith.
17: LAUNCELOT: By your leave, sir.
18: LORENZO: Whither goest thou?
19: LAUNCELOT: Marry, sir, to bid my old master the
20: Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian.
21: LORENZO: Hold here, take this: tell gentle Jessica
22: I will not fail her; speak it privately.
23: Go, gentlemen,
24: Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?
25: I am provided of a torch-bearer.
26: SALANIO: Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.
27: And so will I.
28: LORENZO: Meet me and Gratiano
29: At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.
30: SALARINO: 'Tis good we do so.
31: GRATIANO: Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
32: LORENZO: I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
33: How I shall take her from her father's house,
34: What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with,
35: What page's suit she hath in readiness.
36: If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,
37: It will be for his gentle daughter's sake:
38: And never dare misfortune cross her foot,
39: Unless she do it under this excuse,
40: That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
41: Come, go with me; peruse this as thou goest:
42: Fair Jessica shall be my torch-beare r.
ACT 2 SCENE 5

1: SHYLOCK: Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,
2: The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:--
3: What, Jessica!--thou shalt not gormandise,
4: As thou hast done with me:--What, Jessica!--
5: And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out;--
6: Why, Jessica, I say!
7: LAUNCELOT: Why, Jessica!
8: SHYLOCK: Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.
9: LAUNCELOT: Your worship was wont to tell me that
10: I could do nothing without bidding.
11: JESSICA: Call you? what is your will?
12: SHYLOCK: I am bid forth to supper, Jessica:
13: There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?
14: I am not bid for love; they flatter me:
15: But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon
16: The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,
17: Look to my house. I am right loath to go:
18: There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,
19: For I did dream of money-bags to-night.
20: LAUNCELOT: I beseech you, sir, go: my young master doth expect
21: your reproach.
22: SHYLOCK: So do I his.
23: LAUNCELOT: An they have conspired together, I will not say you
24: shall see a masque; but if you do, then it was not
25: for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on
26: Black-Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning,
27: falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four
28: year, in the afternoon.
29: SHYLOCK: What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
30: Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
31: And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,
32: Clamber not you up to the casements then,
33: Nor thrust your head into the public street
34: To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces,
35: But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements:
36: Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
37: My sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear,
38: I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:
39: But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah;
40: Say I will come.
41: LAUNCELOT: I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at
42: window, for all this, There will come a Christian
43: boy, will be worth a Jewess' eye.
44: SHYLOCK: What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?
45: JESSICA: His words were 'Farewell mistress;' nothing else.
46: SHYLOCK: The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder;
47: Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day
48: More than the wild-cat: drones hive not with me;
49: Therefore I part with him, and part with him
50: To one that would have him help to waste
51: His borrow'd purse. Well, Jessica, go in;
52: Perhaps I will return immediately:
53: Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:
54: Fast bind, fast find;
55: A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.
56: JESSICA: Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,
57: I have a father, you a daughter, lost.
ACT 2 SCENE 6

1: GRATIANO: This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
2: Desired us to make stand.
3: SALARINO: His hour is almost past.
4: GRATIANO: And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
5: For lovers ever run before the clock.
6: SALARINO: O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
7: To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wont
8: To keep obliged faith unforfeited!
9: GRATIANO: That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
10: With that keen appetite that he sits down?
11: Where is the horse that doth untread again
12: His tedious measures with the unbated fire
13: That he did pace them first? All things that are,
14: Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.
15: How like a younker or a prodigal
16: The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
17: Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!
18: How like the prodigal doth she return,
19: With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,
20: Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!
21: SALARINO: Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.
22: LORENZO: Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
23: Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:
24: When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
25: I'll watch as long for you then. Approach;
26: Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within?
27: JESSICA: Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
28: Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.
29: LORENZO: Lorenzo, and thy love.
30: JESSICA: Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
31: For who love I so much? And now who knows
32: But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
33: LORENZO: Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
34: JESSICA: Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
35: I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,
36: For I am much ashamed of my exchange:
37: But love is blind and lovers cannot see
38: The pretty follies that themselves commit;
39: For if they could, Cupid himself would blush
40: To see me thus transformed to a boy.
41: LORENZO: Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.
42: JESSICA: What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
43: They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light.
44: Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;
45: And I should be obscured.
46: LORENZO: So are you, sweet,
47: Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
48: But come at once;
49: For the close night doth play the runaway,
50: And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.
51: JESSICA: I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
52: With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
53: GRATIANO: Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.
54: LORENZO: Beshrew me but I love her heartily;
55: For she is wise, if I can judge of her,
56: And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
57: And true she is, as she hath proved herself,
58: And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true,
59: Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
60: What, art thou come? On, gentlemen; away!
61: Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.
62: ANTONIO: Who's there?
63: GRATIANO: Signior Antonio!
64: ANTONIO: Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
65: 'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.
66: No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
67: Bassanio presently will go aboard:
68: I have sent twenty out to seek for you.
69: GRATIANO: I am glad on't: I desire no more delight
70: Than to be under sail and gone to-night.
ACT 2 SCENE 7

1: PORTIA: Go draw aside the curtains and discover
2: The several caskets to this noble prince.
3: Now make your choice.
4: MOROCCO: The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,
5: 'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;'
6: The second, silver, which this promise carries,
7: 'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'
8: This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
9: 'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
10: How shall I know if I do choose the right?
11: PORTIA: The one of them contains my picture, prince:
12: If you choose that, then I am yours withal.
13: MOROCCO: Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
14: I will survey the inscriptions back again.
15: What says this leaden casket?
16: 'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
17: Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
18: This casket threatens. Men that hazard all
19: Do it in hope of fair advantages:
20: A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
21: I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
22: What says the silver with her virgin hue?
23: 'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
24: As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,
25: And weigh thy value with an even hand:
26: If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,
27: Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough
28: May not extend so far as to the lady:
29: And yet to be afeard of my deserving
30: Were but a weak disabling of myself.
31: As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:
32: I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,
33: In graces and in qualities of breeding;
34: But more than these, in love I do deserve.
35: What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?
36: Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
37: 'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
38: Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;
39: From the four corners of the earth they come,
40: To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:
41: The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
42: Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
43: For princes to come view fair Portia:
44: The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head
45: Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
46: To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,
47: As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.
48: One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
49: Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation
50: To think so base a thought: it were too gross
51: To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
52: Or shall I think in silver she's immured,
53: Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
54: O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
55: Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
56: A coin that bears the figure of an angel
57: Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;
58: But here an angel in a golden bed
59: Lies all within. Deliver me the key:
60: Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!
61: PORTIA: There, take it, prince; and if my form lie there,
62: Then I am yours.
63: MOROCCO: O hell! what have we here?
64: A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
65: There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.
66: All that glitters is not gold;
67: Often have you heard that told:
68: Many a man his life hath sold
69: But my outside to behold:
70: Gilded tombs do worms enfold.
71: Had you been as wise as bold,
72: Young in limbs, in judgment old,
73: Your answer had not been inscroll'd:
74: Fare you well; your suit is cold.
75: Cold, indeed; and labour lost:
76: Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!
77: Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart
78: To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.
79: PORTIA: A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.
80: Let all of his complexion choose me so.
ACT 2 SCENE 8

1: SALARINO: Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:
2: With him is Gratiano gone along;
3: And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.
4: SALANIO: The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,
5: Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.
6: SALARINO: He came too late, the ship was under sail:
7: But there the duke was given to understand
8: That in a gondola were seen together
9: Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:
10: Besides, Antonio certified the duke
11: They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
12: SALANIO: I never heard a passion so confused,
13: So strange, outrageous, and so variable,
14: As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:
15: 'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!
16: Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!
17: Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!
18: A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
19: Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!
20: And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,
21: Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;
22: She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'
23: SALARINO: Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
24: Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.
25: SALANIO: Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
26: Or he shall pay for this.
27: SALARINO: Marry, well remember'd.
28: I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
29: Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
30: The French and English, there miscarried
31: A vessel of our country richly fraught:
32: I thought upon Antonio when he told me;
33: And wish'd in silence that it were not his.
34: SALANIO: You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
35: Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.
36: SALARINO: A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
37: I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:
38: Bassanio told him he would make some speed
39: Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;
40: Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio
41: But stay the very riping of the time;
42: And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,
43: Let it not enter in your mind of love:
44: Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts
45: To courtship and such fair ostents of love
46: As shall conveniently become you there:'
47: And even there, his eye being big with tears,
48: Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,
49: And with affection wondrous sensible
50: He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.
51: SALANIO: I think he only loves the world for him.
52: I pray thee, let us go and find him out
53: And quicken his embraced heaviness
54: With some delight or other.
55: SALARINO: Do we so.
ACT 2 SCENE 9

1: NERISSA: Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain straight:
2: The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,
3: And comes to his election presently.
4: PORTIA: Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:
5: If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,
6: Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:
7: But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,
8: You must be gone from hence immediately.
9: ARRAGON: I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
10: First, never to unfold to any one
11: Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail
12: Of the right casket, never in my life
13: To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,
14: If I do fail in fortune of my choice,
15: Immediately to leave you and be gone.
16: PORTIA: To these injunctions every one doth swear
17: That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
18: ARRAGON: And so have I address'd me. Fortune now
19: To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.
20: 'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
21: You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.
22: What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:
23: 'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
24: What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant
25: By the fool multitude, that choose by show,
26: Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
27: Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,
28: Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
29: Even in the force and road of casualty.
30: I will not choose what many men desire,
31: Because I will not jump with common spirits
32: And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
33: Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;
34: Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
35: 'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'
36: And well said too; for who shall go about
37: To cozen fortune and be honourable
38: Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
39: To wear an undeserved dignity.
40: O, that estates, degrees and offices
41: Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour
42: Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
43: How many then should cover that stand bare!
44: How many be commanded that command!
45: How much low peasantry would then be glean'd
46: From the true seed of honour! and how much honour
47: Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
48: To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:
49: 'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
50: I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,
51: And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
52: PORTIA: Too long a pause for that which you find there.
53: ARRAGON: What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,
54: Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.
55: How much unlike art thou to Portia!
56: How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
57: 'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'
58: Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
59: Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?
60: PORTIA: To offend, and judge, are distinct offices
61: And of opposed natures.
62: ARRAGON: What is here?
63: The fire seven times tried this:
64: Seven times tried that judgment is,
65: That did never choose amiss.
66: Some there be that shadows kiss;
67: Such have but a shadow's bliss:
68: There be fools alive, I wis,
69: Silver'd o'er; and so was this.
70: Take what wife you will to bed,
71: I will ever be your head:
72: So be gone: you are sped.
73: Still more fool I shall appear
74: By the time I linger here
75: With one fool's head I came to woo,
76: But I go away with two.
77: Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath,
78: Patiently to bear my wroth.
79: PORTIA: Thus hath the candle singed the moth.
80: O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,
81: They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.
82: NERISSA: The ancient saying is no heresy,
83: Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.
84: PORTIA: Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.
85: Servant: Where is my lady?
86: PORTIA: Here: what would my lord?
87: Servant: Madam, there is alighted at your gate
88: A young Venetian, one that comes before
89: To signify the approaching of his lord;
90: From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,
91: To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,
92: Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
93: So likely an ambassador of love:
94: A day in April never came so sweet,
95: To show how costly summer was at hand,
96: As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.
97: PORTIA: No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard
98: Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,
99: Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.
100: Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see
101: Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.
ACT 3 SCENE 1

1: SALANIO: Now, what news on the Rialto?
2: SALARINO: Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath
3: a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;
4: the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very
5: dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many
6: a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip
7: Report be an honest woman of her word.
8: SALANIO: I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever
9: knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she
10: wept for the death of a third husband. But it is
11: true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the
12: plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the
13: honest Antonio,--O that I had a title good enough
14: to keep his name company!--
15: SALARINO: Come, the full stop.
16: SALANIO: Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath
17: lost a ship.
18: SALARINO: I would it might prove the end of his losses.
19: SALANIO: Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my
20: prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.
21: How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?
22: SHYLOCK: You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my
23: daughter's flight.
24: SALARINO: That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor
25: that made the wings she flew withal.
26: SALANIO: And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was
27: fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all
28: to leave the dam.
29: SHYLOCK: She is damned for it.
30: SALANIO: That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.
31: SHYLOCK: My own flesh and blood to rebel!
32: SALANIO: Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?
33: SHYLOCK: I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.
34: SALARINO: There is more difference between thy flesh and hers
35: than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods
36: than there is between red wine and rhenish. But
37: tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any
38: loss at sea or no?
39: SHYLOCK: There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a
40: prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the
41: Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon
42: the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to
43: call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was
44: wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him
45: look to his bond.
46: SALARINO: Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take
47: his flesh: what's that good for?
48: SHYLOCK: To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,
49: it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and
50: hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,
51: mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my
52: bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
53: enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath
54: not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,
55: dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with
56: the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject
57: to the same diseases, healed by the same means,
58: warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as
59: a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?
60: if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison
61: us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not
62: revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will
63: resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,
64: what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian
65: wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by
66: Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you
67: teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I
68: will better the instruction.
69: Servant: Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and
70: desires to speak with you both.
71: SALARINO: We have been up and down to seek him.
72: SALANIO: Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be
73: matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.
74: SHYLOCK: How now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou
75: found my daughter?
76: TUBAL: I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.
77: SHYLOCK: Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone,
78: cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse
79: never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it
80: till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other
81: precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter
82: were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!
83: would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in
84: her coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know
85: not what's spent in the search: why, thou loss upon
86: loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to
87: find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:
88: nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my
89: shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears
90: but of my shedding.
91: TUBAL: Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I
92: heard in Genoa,--
93: SHYLOCK: What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?
94: TUBAL: Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.
95: SHYLOCK: I thank God, I thank God. Is't true, is't true?
96: TUBAL: I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
97: SHYLOCK: I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!
98: ha, ha! where? in Genoa?
99: TUBAL: Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one
100: night fourscore ducats.
101: SHYLOCK: Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my
102: gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!
103: fourscore ducats!
104: TUBAL: There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my
105: company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.
106: SHYLOCK: I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture
107: him: I am glad of it.
108: TUBAL: One of them showed me a ring that he had of your
109: daughter for a monkey.
110: SHYLOCK: Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my
111: turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:
112: I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.
113: TUBAL: But Antonio is certainly undone.
114: SHYLOCK: Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee
115: me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I
116: will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were
117: he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I
118: will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;
119: go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.
ACT 3 SCENE 2

1: PORTIA: I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two
2: Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,
3: I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.
4: There's something tells me, but it is not love,
5: I would not lose you; and you know yourself,
6: Hate counsels not in such a quality.
7: But lest you should not understand me well,--
8: And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--
9: I would detain you here some month or two
10: Before you venture for me. I could teach you
11: How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;
12: So will I never be: so may you miss me;
13: But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,
14: That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,
15: They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;
16: One half of me is yours, the other half yours,
17: Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
18: And so all yours. O, these naughty times
19: Put bars between the owners and their rights!
20: And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,
21: Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.
22: I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,
23: To eke it and to draw it out in length,
24: To stay you from election.
25: BASSANIO: Let me choose
26: For as I am, I live upon the rack.
27: PORTIA: Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess
28: What treason there is mingled with your love.
29: BASSANIO: None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
30: Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:
31: There may as well be amity and life
32: 'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.
33: PORTIA: Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
34: Where men enforced do speak anything.
35: BASSANIO: Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.
36: PORTIA: Well then, confess and live.
37: BASSANIO: 'Confess' and 'love'
38: Had been the very sum of my confession:
39: O happy torment, when my torturer
40: Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
41: But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
42: PORTIA: Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:
43: If you do love me, you will find me out.
44: Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
45: Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
46: Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,
47: Fading in music: that the comparison
48: May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
49: And watery death-bed for him. He may win;
50: And what is music then? Then music is
51: Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
52: To a new-crowned monarch: such it is
53: As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
54: That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,
55: And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,
56: With no less presence, but with much more love,
57: Than young Alcides, when he did redeem
58: The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
59: To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice
60: The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,
61: With bleared visages, come forth to view
62: The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!
63: Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay
64: I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.
65: SONG.
66: Tell me where is fancy bred,
67: Or in the heart, or in the head?
68: How begot, how nourished?
69: Reply, reply.
70: It is engender'd in the eyes,
71: With gazing fed; and fancy dies
72: In the cradle where it lies.
73: Let us all ring fancy's knell
74: I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.
75: ALL: Ding, dong, bell.
76: BASSANIO: So may the outward shows be least themselves:
77: The world is still deceived with ornament.
78: In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,
79: But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,
80: Obscures the show of evil? In religion,
81: What damned error, but some sober brow
82: Will bless it and approve it with a text,
83: Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
84: There is no vice so simple but assumes
85: Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
86: How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false
87: As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
88: The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;
89: Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;
90: And these assume but valour's excrement
91: To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,
92: And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;
93: Which therein works a miracle in nature,
94: Making them lightest that wear most of it:
95: So are those crisped snaky golden locks
96: Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,
97: Upon supposed fairness, often known
98: To be the dowry of a second head,
99: The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
100: Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
101: To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
102: Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,
103: The seeming truth which cunning times put on
104: To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
105: Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;
106: Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
107: 'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,
108: Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,
109: Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;
110: And here choose I; joy be the consequence!
111: PORTIA: [Aside] How all the other passions fleet to air,
112: As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,
113: And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,
114: Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,
115: In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.
116: I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,
117: For fear I surfeit.
118: BASSANIO: What find I here?
119: Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god
120: Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?
121: Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,
122: Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,
123: Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar
124: Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs
125: The painter plays the spider and hath woven
126: A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,
127: Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--
128: How could he see to do them? having made one,
129: Methinks it should have power to steal both his
130: And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far
131: The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
132: In underprizing it, so far this shadow
133: Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,
134: The continent and summary of my fortune.
135: You that choose not by the view,
136: Chance as fair and choose as true!
137: Since this fortune falls to you,
138: Be content and seek no new,
139: If you be well pleased with this
140: And hold your fortune for your bliss,
141: Turn you where your lady is
142: And claim her with a loving kiss.
143: A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
144: I come by note, to give and to receive.
145: Like one of two contending in a prize,
146: That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,
147: Hearing applause and universal shout,
148: Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
149: Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;
150: So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;
151: As doubtful whether what I see be true,
152: Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.
153: PORTIA: You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,
154: Such as I am: though for myself alone
155: I would not be ambitious in my wish,
156: To wish myself much better; yet, for you
157: I would be trebled twenty times myself;
158: A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;
159: That only to stand high in your account,
160: I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,
161: Exceed account; but the full sum of me
162: Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,
163: Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;
164: Happy in this, she is not yet so old
165: But she may learn; happier than this,
166: She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
167: Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
168: Commits itself to yours to be directed,
169: As from her lord, her governor, her king.
170: Myself and what is mine to you and yours
171: Is now converted: but now I was the lord
172: Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
173: Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,
174: This house, these servants and this same myself
175: Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;
176: Which when you part from, lose, or give away,
177: Let it presage the ruin of your love
178: And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
179: BASSANIO: Madam, you have bereft me of all words,
180: Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
181: And there is such confusion in my powers,
182: As after some oration fairly spoke
183: By a beloved prince, there doth appear
184: Among the buzzing pleased multitude;
185: Where every something, being blent together,
186: Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,
187: Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
188: Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:
189: O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!
190: NERISSA: My lord and lady, it is now our time,
191: That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,
192: To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!
193: GRATIANO: My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,
194: I wish you all the joy that you can wish;
195: For I am sure you can wish none from me:
196: And when your honours mean to solemnize
197: The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,
198: Even at that time I may be married too.
199: BASSANIO: With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
200: GRATIANO: I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
201: My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:
202: You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;
203: You loved, I loved for intermission.
204: No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.
205: Your fortune stood upon the casket there,
206: And so did mine too, as the matter falls;
207: For wooing here until I sweat again,
208: And sweating until my very roof was dry
209: With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,
210: I got a promise of this fair one here
211: To have her love, provided that your fortune
212: Achieved her mistress.
213: PORTIA: Is this true, Nerissa?
214: NERISSA: Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.
215: BASSANIO: And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?
216: GRATIANO: Yes, faith, my lord.
217: BASSANIO: Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.
218: GRATIANO: We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.
219: NERISSA: What, and stake down?
220: GRATIANO: No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down.
221: But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,
222: and my old Venetian friend Salerio?
223: BASSANIO: Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;
224: If that the youth of my new interest here
225: Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,
226: I bid my very friends and countrymen,
227: Sweet Portia, welcome.
228: PORTIA: So do I, my lord:
229: They are entirely welcome.
230: LORENZO: I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,
231: My purpose was not to have seen you here;
232: But meeting with Salerio by the way,
233: He did entreat me, past all saying nay,
234: To come with him along.
235: SALERIO: I did, my lord;
236: And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio
237: Commends him to you.
238: BASSANIO: Ere I ope his letter,
239: I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.
240: SALERIO: Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
241: Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there
242: Will show you his estate.
243: GRATIANO: Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.
244: Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?
245: How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
246: I know he will be glad of our success;
247: We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.
248: SALERIO: I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
249: PORTIA: There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,
250: That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:
251: Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world
252: Could turn so much the constitution
253: Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!
254: With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,
255: And I must freely have the half of anything
256: That this same paper brings you.
257: BASSANIO: O sweet Portia,
258: Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
259: That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,
260: When I did first impart my love to you,
261: I freely told you, all the wealth I had
262: Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;
263: And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,
264: Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
265: How much I was a braggart. When I told you
266: My state was nothing, I should then have told you
267: That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,
268: I have engaged myself to a dear friend,
269: Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,
270: To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;
271: The paper as the body of my friend,
272: And every word in it a gaping wound,
273: Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?
274: Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?
275: From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
276: From Lisbon, Barbary and India?
277: And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
278: Of merchant-marring rocks?
279: SALERIO: Not one, my lord.
280: Besides, it should appear, that if he had
281: The present money to discharge the Jew,
282: He would not take it. Never did I know
283: A creature, that did bear the shape of man,
284: So keen and greedy to confound a man:
285: He plies the duke at morning and at night,
286: And doth impeach the freedom of the state,
287: If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,
288: The duke himself, and the magnificoes
289: Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;
290: But none can drive him from the envious plea
291: Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.
292: JESSICA: When I was with him I have heard him swear
293: To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,
294: That he would rather have Antonio's flesh
295: Than twenty times the value of the sum
296: That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,
297: If law, authority and power deny not,
298: It will go hard with poor Antonio.
299: PORTIA: Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
300: BASSANIO: The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
301: The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit
302: In doing courtesies, and one in whom
303: The ancient Roman honour more appears
304: Than any that draws breath in Italy.
305: PORTIA: What sum owes he the Jew?
306: BASSANIO: For me three thousand ducats.
307: PORTIA: What, no more?
308: Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;
309: Double six thousand, and then treble that,
310: Before a friend of this description
311: Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
312: First go with me to church and call me wife,
313: And then away to Venice to your friend;
314: For never shall you lie by Portia's side
315: With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
316: To pay the petty debt twenty times over:
317: When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
318: My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
319: Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!
320: For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:
321: Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:
322: Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
323: But let me hear the letter of your friend.
324: BASSANIO: [Reads] Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all
325: miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is
326: very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since
327: in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all
328: debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but
329: see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your
330: pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,
331: let not my letter.
332: PORTIA: O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!
333: BASSANIO: Since I have your good leave to go away,
334: I will make haste: but, till I come again,
335: No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,
336: No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.
ACT 3 SCENE 3

1: SHYLOCK: Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;
2: This is the fool that lent out money gratis:
3: Gaoler, look to him.
4: ANTONIO: Hear me yet, good Shylock.
5: SHYLOCK: I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:
6: I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
7: Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;
8: But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:
9: The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,
10: Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
11: To come abroad with him at his request.
12: ANTONIO: I pray thee, hear me speak.
13: SHYLOCK: I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:
14: I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.
15: I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,
16: To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield
17: To Christian intercessors. Follow not;
18: I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.
19: SALARINO: It is the most impenetrable cur
20: That ever kept with men.
21: ANTONIO: Let him alone:
22: I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
23: He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
24: I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
25: Many that have at times made moan to me;
26: Therefore he hates me.
27: SALARINO: I am sure the duke
28: Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
29: ANTONIO: The duke cannot deny the course of law:
30: For the commodity that strangers have
31: With us in Venice, if it be denied,
32: Will much impeach the justice of his state;
33: Since that the trade and profit of the city
34: Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:
35: These griefs and losses have so bated me,
36: That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
37: To-morrow to my bloody creditor.
38: Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come
39: To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!
ACT 3 SCENE 4

1: LORENZO: Madam, although I speak it in your presence,
2: You have a noble and a true conceit
3: Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly
4: In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
5: But if you knew to whom you show this honour,
6: How true a gentleman you send relief,
7: How dear a lover of my lord your husband,
8: I know you would be prouder of the work
9: Than customary bounty can enforce you.
10: PORTIA: I never did repent for doing good,
11: Nor shall not now: for in companions
12: That do converse and waste the time together,
13: Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,
14: There must be needs a like proportion
15: Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;
16: Which makes me think that this Antonio,
17: Being the bosom lover of my lord,
18: Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,
19: How little is the cost I have bestow'd
20: In purchasing the semblance of my soul
21: From out the state of hellish misery!
22: This comes too near the praising of myself;
23: Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
24: Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
25: The husbandry and manage of my house
26: Until my lord's return: for mine own part,
27: I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
28: To live in prayer and contemplation,
29: Only attended by Nerissa here,
30: Until her husband and my lord's return:
31: There is a monastery two miles off;
32: And there will we abide. I do desire you
33: Not to deny this imposition;
34: The which my love and some necessity
35: Now lays upon you.
36: LORENZO: Madam, with all my heart;
37: I shall obey you in all fair commands.
38: PORTIA: My people do already know my mind,
39: And will acknowledge you and Jessica
40: In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
41: And so farewell, till we shall meet again.
42: LORENZO: Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!
43: JESSICA: I wish your ladyship all heart's content.
44: PORTIA: I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased
45: To wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica.
46: Now, Balthasar,
47: As I have ever found thee honest-true,
48: So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,
49: And use thou all the endeavour of a man
50: In speed to Padua: see thou render this
51: Into my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario;
52: And, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee,
53: Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed
54: Unto the tranect, to the common ferry
55: Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,
56: But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.
57: BALTHASAR: Madam, I go with all convenient speed.
58: PORTIA: Come on, Nerissa; I have work in hand
59: That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands
60: Before they think of us.
61: NERISSA: Shall they see us?
62: PORTIA: They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,
63: That they shall think we are accomplished
64: With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,
65: When we are both accoutred like young men,
66: I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,
67: And wear my dagger with the braver grace,
68: And speak between the change of man and boy
69: With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps
70: Into a manly stride, and speak of frays
71: Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,
72: How honourable ladies sought my love,
73: Which I denying, they fell sick and died;
74: I could not do withal; then I'll repent,
75: And wish for all that, that I had not killed them;
76: And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,
77: That men shall swear I have discontinued school
78: Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind
79: A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
80: Which I will practise.
81: NERISSA: Why, shall we turn to men?
82: PORTIA: Fie, what a question's that,
83: If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!
84: But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device
85: When I am in my coach, which stays for us
86: At the park gate; and therefore haste away,
87: For we must measure twenty miles to-day.
ACT 3 SCENE 5

1: LAUNCELOT: Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father
2: are to be laid upon the children: therefore, I
3: promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with
4: you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:
5: therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you
6: are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do
7: you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard
8: hope neither.
9: JESSICA: And what hope is that, I pray thee?
10: LAUNCELOT: Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you
11: not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.
12: JESSICA: That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the
13: sins of my mother should be visited upon me.
14: LAUNCELOT: Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and
15: mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I
16: fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are
17: gone both ways.
18: JESSICA: I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a
19: Christian.
20: LAUNCELOT: Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians
21: enow before; e'en as many as could well live, one by
22: another. This making Christians will raise the
23: price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we
24: shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.
25: JESSICA: I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes.
26: LORENZO: I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if
27: you thus get my wife into corners.
28: JESSICA: Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I
29: are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for
30: me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he
31: says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,
32: for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the
33: price of pork.
34: LORENZO: I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than
35: you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the
36: Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.
37: LAUNCELOT: It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:
38: but if she be less than an honest woman, she is
39: indeed more than I took her for.
40: LORENZO: How every fool can play upon the word! I think the
41: best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,
42: and discourse grow commendable in none only but
43: parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.
44: LAUNCELOT: That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.
45: LORENZO: Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! then bid
46: them prepare dinner.
47: LAUNCELOT: That is done too, sir; only 'cover' is the word.
48: LORENZO: Will you cover then, sir?
49: LAUNCELOT: Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.
50: LORENZO: Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show
51: the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray
52: tree, understand a plain man in his plain meaning:
53: go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, serve
54: in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.
55: LAUNCELOT: For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the
56: meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in
57: to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and
58: conceits shall govern.
59: LORENZO: O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
60: The fool hath planted in his memory
61: An army of good words; and I do know
62: A many fools, that stand in better place,
63: Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
64: Defy the matter. How cheerest thou, Jessica?
65: And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,
66: How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?
67: JESSICA: Past all expressing. It is very meet
68: The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;
69: For, having such a blessing in his lady,
70: He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;
71: And if on earth he do not mean it, then
72: In reason he should never come to heaven
73: Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match
74: And on the wager lay two earthly women,
75: And Portia one, there must be something else
76: Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world
77: Hath not her fellow.
78: LORENZO: Even such a husband
79: Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.
80: JESSICA: Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
81: LORENZO: I will anon: first, let us go to dinner.
82: JESSICA: Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.
83: LORENZO: No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;
84: ' Then, howso'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things
85: I shall digest it.
ACT 4 SCENE 1

1: DUKE: What, is Antonio here?
2: ANTONIO: Ready, so please your grace.
3: DUKE: I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
4: A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch
5: uncapable of pity, void and empty
6: From any dram of mercy.
7: ANTONIO: I have heard
8: Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
9: His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate
10: And that no lawful means can carry me
11: Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
12: My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
13: To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
14: The very tyranny and rage of his.
15: DUKE: Go one, and call the Jew into the court.
16: SALERIO: He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.
17: DUKE: Make room, and let him stand before our face.
18: Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
19: That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
20: To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought
21: Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
22: Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
23: And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
24: Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
25: Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
26: But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
27: Forgive a moiety of the principal;
28: Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
29: That have of late so huddled on his back,
30: Enow to press a royal merchant down
31: And pluck commiseration of his state
32: From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
33: From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd
34: To offices of tender courtesy.
35: We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
36: SHYLOCK: I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;
37: And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
38: To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
39: If you deny it, let the danger light
40: Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
41: You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
42: A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
43: Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
44: But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?
45: What if my house be troubled with a rat
46: And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
47: To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?
48: Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
49: Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
50: And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,
51: Cannot contain their urine: for affection,
52: Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
53: Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:
54: As there is no firm reason to be render'd,
55: Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
56: Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
57: Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
58: Must yield to such inevitable shame
59: As to offend, himself being offended;
60: So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
61: More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
62: I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
63: A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?
64: BASSANIO: This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
65: To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
66: SHYLOCK: I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
67: BASSANIO: Do all men kill the things they do not love?
68: SHYLOCK: Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
69: BASSANIO: Every offence is not a hate at first.
70: SHYLOCK: What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
71: ANTONIO: I pray you, think you question with the Jew:
72: You may as well go stand upon the beach
73: And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
74: You may as well use question with the wolf
75: Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
76: You may as well forbid the mountain pines
77: To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
78: When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;
79: You may as well do anything most hard,
80: As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--
81: His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,
82: Make no more offers, use no farther means,
83: But with all brief and plain conveniency
84: Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.
85: BASSANIO: For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
86: SHYLOCK: What judgment shall I dread, doing
87: Were in six parts and every part a ducat,
88: I would not draw them; I would have my bond.
89: DUKE: How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?
90: SHYLOCK: What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
91: You have among you many a purchased slave,
92: Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,
93: You use in abject and in slavish parts,
94: Because you bought them: shall I say to you,
95: Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
96: Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds
97: Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
98: Be season'd with such viands? You will answer
99: 'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:
100: The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,
101: Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.
102: If you deny me, fie upon your law!
103: There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
104: I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?
105: DUKE: Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
106: Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,
107: Whom I have sent for to determine this,
108: Come here to-day.
109: SALERIO: My lord, here stays without
110: A messenger with letters from the doctor,
111: New come from Padua.
112: DUKE: Bring us the letter; call the messenger.
113: BASSANIO: Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!
114: The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,
115: Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
116: ANTONIO: I am a tainted wether of the flock,
117: Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
118: Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me
119: You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,
120: Than to live still and write mine epitaph.
121: DUKE: Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
122: NERISSA: From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.
123: BASSANIO: Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
124: SHYLOCK: To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
125: GRATIANO: Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
126: Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,
127: No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness
128: Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
129: SHYLOCK: No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
130: GRATIANO: O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
131: And for thy life let justice be accused.
132: Thou almost makest me waver in my faith
133: To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
134: That souls of animals infuse themselves
135: Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit
136: Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,
137: Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,
138: And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,
139: Infused itself in thee; for thy desires
140: Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.
141: SHYLOCK: Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
142: Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
143: Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall
144: To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.
145: DUKE: This letter from Bellario doth commend
146: A young and learned doctor to our court.
147: Where is he?
148: NERISSA: He attendeth here hard by,
149: To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.
150: DUKE: With all my heart. Some three or four of you
151: Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
152: Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.
153: Clerk: [Reads]
154: Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
155: your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that
156: your messenger came, in loving visitation was with
157: me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I
158: acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
159: the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er
160: many books together: he is furnished with my
161: opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the
162: greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes
163: with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's
164: request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of
165: years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
166: estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so
167: old a head. I leave him to your gracious
168: acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his
169: commendation.
170: DUKE: You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:
171: And here, I take it, is the doctor come.
172: Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?
173: PORTIA: I did, my lord.
174: DUKE: You are welcome: take your place.
175: Are you acquainted with the difference
176: That holds this present question in the court?
177: PORTIA: I am informed thoroughly of the cause.
178: Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?
179: DUKE: Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
180: PORTIA: Is your name Shylock?
181: SHYLOCK: Shylock is my name.
182: PORTIA: Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
183: Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
184: Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
185: You stand within his danger, do you not?
186: ANTONIO: Ay, so he says.
187: PORTIA: Do you confess the bond?
188: ANTONIO: I do.
189: PORTIA: Then must the Jew be merciful.
190: SHYLOCK: On what compulsion must I? tell me that.
191: PORTIA: The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
192: It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
193: Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
194: It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
195: 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
196: The throned monarch better than his crown;
197: His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
198: The attribute to awe and majesty,
199: Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
200: But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
201: It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
202: It is an attribute to God himself;
203: And earthly power doth then show likest God's
204: When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
205: Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
206: That, in the course of justice, none of us
207: Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
208: And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
209: The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
210: To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
211: Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
212: Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
213: SHYLOCK: My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
214: The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
215: PORTIA: Is he not able to discharge the money?
216: BASSANIO: Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
217: Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
218: I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
219: On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
220: If this will not suffice, it must appear
221: That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,
222: Wrest once the law to your authority:
223: To do a great right, do a little wrong,
224: And curb this cruel devil of his will.
225: PORTIA: It must not be; there is no power in Venice
226: Can alter a decree established:
227: 'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
228: And many an error by the same example
229: Will rush into the state: it cannot be.
230: SHYLOCK: A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!
231: O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!
232: PORTIA: I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
233: SHYLOCK: Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.
234: PORTIA: Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.
235: SHYLOCK: An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:
236: Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
237: No, not for Venice.
238: PORTIA: Why, this bond is forfeit;
239: And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
240: A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
241: Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
242: Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
243: SHYLOCK: When it is paid according to the tenor.
244: It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
245: You know the law, your exposition
246: Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,
247: Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
248: Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear
249: There is no power in the tongue of man
250: To alter me: I stay here on my bond.
251: ANTONIO: Most heartily I do beseech the court
252: To give the judgment.
253: PORTIA: Why then, thus it is:
254: You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
255: SHYLOCK: O noble judge! O excellent young man!
256: PORTIA: For the intent and purpose of the law
257: Hath full relation to the penalty,
258: Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
259: SHYLOCK: 'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!
260: How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
261: PORTIA: Therefore lay bare your bosom.
262: SHYLOCK: Ay, his breast:
263: So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?
264: 'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.
265: PORTIA: It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
266: The flesh?
267: SHYLOCK: I have them ready.
268: PORTIA: Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
269: To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.
270: SHYLOCK: Is it so nominated in the bond?
271: PORTIA: It is not so express'd: but what of that?
272: 'Twere good you do so much for charity.
273: SHYLOCK: I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.
274: PORTIA: You, merchant, have you any thing to say?
275: ANTONIO: But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.
276: Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!
277: Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
278: For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
279: Than is her custom: it is still her use
280: To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
281: To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
282: An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
283: Of such misery doth she cut me off.
284: Commend me to your honourable wife:
285: Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
286: Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
287: And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
288: Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
289: Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
290: And he repents not that he pays your debt;
291: For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
292: I'll pay it presently with all my heart.
293: BASSANIO: Antonio, I am married to a wife
294: Which is as dear to me as life itself;
295: But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
296: Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:
297: I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
298: Here to this devil, to deliver you.
299: PORTIA: Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
300: If she were by, to hear you make the offer.
301: GRATIANO: I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:
302: I would she were in heaven, so she could
303: Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
304: NERISSA: 'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
305: The wish would make else an unquiet house.
306: SHYLOCK: These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;
307: Would any of the stock of Barrabas
308: Had been her husband rather than a Christian!
309: We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.
310: PORTIA: A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:
311: The court awards it, and the law doth give it.
312: SHYLOCK: Most rightful judge!
313: PORTIA: And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
314: The law allows it, and the court awards it.
315: SHYLOCK: Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!
316: PORTIA: Tarry a little; there is something else.
317: This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
318: The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
319: Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;
320: But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
321: One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
322: Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate
323: Unto the state of Venice.
324: GRATIANO: O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!
325: SHYLOCK: Is that the law?
326: PORTIA: Thyself shalt see the act:
327: For, as thou urgest justice, be assured
328: Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.
329: GRATIANO: O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!
330: SHYLOCK: I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice
331: And let the Christian go.
332: BASSANIO: Here is the money.
333: PORTIA: Soft!
334: The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:
335: He shall have nothing but the penalty.
336: GRATIANO: O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!
337: PORTIA: Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
338: Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more
339: But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
340: Or less than a just pound, be it but so much
341: As makes it light or heavy in the substance,
342: Or the division of the twentieth part
343: Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn
344: But in the estimation of a hair,
345: Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.
346: GRATIANO: A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
347: Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
348: PORTIA: Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.
349: SHYLOCK: Give me my principal, and let me go.
350: BASSANIO: I have it ready for thee; here it is.
351: PORTIA: He hath refused it in the open court:
352: He shall have merely justice and his bond.
353: GRATIANO: A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!
354: I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
355: SHYLOCK: Shall I not have barely my principal?
356: PORTIA: Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,
357: To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
358: SHYLOCK: Why, then the devil give him good of it!
359: I'll stay no longer question.
360: PORTIA: Tarry, Jew:
361: The law hath yet another hold on you.
362: It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
363: If it be proved against an alien
364: That by direct or indirect attempts
365: He seek the life of any citizen,
366: The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
367: Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
368: Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
369: And the offender's life lies in the mercy
370: Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
371: In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;
372: For it appears, by manifest proceeding,
373: That indirectly and directly too
374: Thou hast contrived against the very life
375: Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd
376: The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
377: Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.
378: GRATIANO: Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:
379: And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
380: Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
381: Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.
382: DUKE: That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,
383: I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:
384: For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
385: The other half comes to the general state,
386: Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
387: PORTIA: Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.
388: SHYLOCK: Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
389: You take my house when you do take the prop
390: That doth sustain my house; you take my life
391: When you do take the means whereby I live.
392: PORTIA: What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
393: GRATIANO: A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake.
394: ANTONIO: So please my lord the duke and all the court
395: To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
396: I am content; so he will let me have
397: The other half in use, to render it,
398: Upon his death, unto the gentleman
399: That lately stole his daughter:
400: Two things provided more, that, for this favour,
401: He presently become a Christian;
402: The other, that he do record a gift,
403: Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,
404: Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.
405: DUKE: He shall do this, or else I do recant
406: The pardon that I late pronounced here.
407: PORTIA: Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?
408: SHYLOCK: I am content.
409: PORTIA: Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
410: SHYLOCK: I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
411: I am not well: send the deed after me,
412: And I will sign it.
413: DUKE: Get thee gone, but do it.
414: GRATIANO: In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:
415: Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,
416: To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
417: DUKE: Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
418: PORTIA: I humbly do desire your grace of pardon:
419: I must away this night toward Padua,
420: And it is meet I presently set forth.
421: DUKE: I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
422: Antonio, gratify this gentleman,
423: For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.
424: BASSANIO: Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
425: Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
426: Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,
427: Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,
428: We freely cope your courteous pains withal.
429: ANTONIO: And stand indebted, over and above,
430: In love and service to you evermore.
431: PORTIA: He is well paid that is well satisfied;
432: And I, delivering you, am satisfied
433: And therein do account myself well paid:
434: My mind was never yet more mercenary.
435: I pray you, know me when we meet again:
436: I wish you well, and so I take my leave.
437: BASSANIO: Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:
438: Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,
439: Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,
440: Not to deny me, and to pardon me.
441: PORTIA: You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
442: Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;
443: And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:
444: Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;
445: And you in love shall not deny me this.
446: BASSANIO: This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!
447: I will not shame myself to give you this.
448: PORTIA: I will have nothing else but only this;
449: And now methinks I have a mind to it.
450: BASSANIO: There's more depends on this than on the value.
451: The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,
452: And find it out by proclamation:
453: Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.
454: PORTIA: I see, sir, you are liberal in offers
455: You taught me first to beg; and now methinks
456: You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.
457: BASSANIO: Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
458: And when she put it on, she made me vow
459: That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.
460: PORTIA: That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
461: An if your wife be not a mad-woman,
462: And know how well I have deserved the ring,
463: She would not hold out enemy for ever,
464: For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!
465: ANTONIO: My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:
466: Let his deservings and my love withal
467: Be valued against your wife's commandment.
468: BASSANIO: Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;
469: Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,
470: Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste.
471: Come, you and I will thither presently;
472: And in the morning early will we both
473: Fly toward Belmont: come, Antonio.
ACT 4 SCENE 2

1: PORTIA: Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed
2: And let him sign it: we'll away to-night
3: And be a day before our husbands home:
4: This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
5: GRATIANO: Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en
6: My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
7: Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat
8: Your company at dinner.
9: PORTIA: That cannot be:
10: His ring I do accept most thankfully:
11: And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,
12: I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.
13: GRATIANO: That will I do.
14: NERISSA: Sir, I would speak with you.
15: I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,
16: Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.
17: PORTIA: [Aside to NERISSA] Thou mayst, I warrant.
18: We shall have old swearing
19: That they did give the rings away to men;
20: But we'll outface them, and outswear them too.
21: Away! make haste: thou knowist where I will tarry.
ACT 5 SCENE 1

1: LORENZO: The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,
2: When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
3: And they did make no noise, in such a night
4: Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls
5: And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,
6: Where Cressid lay that night.
7: JESSICA: In such a night
8: Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew
9: And saw the lion's shadow ere himself
10: And ran dismay'd away.
11: LORENZO: In such a night
12: Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
13: Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
14: To come again to Carthage.
15: JESSICA: In such a night
16: Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs
17: That did renew old AEson.
18: LORENZO: In such a night
19: Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
20: And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
21: As far as Belmont.
22: JESSICA: In such a night
23: Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,
24: Stealing her soul with many vows of faith
25: And ne'er a true one.
26: LORENZO: In such a night
27: Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,
28: Slander her love, and he forgave it her.
29: JESSICA: I would out-night you, did no body come;
30: But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.
31: LORENZO: Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
32: STEPHANO: A friend.
33: LORENZO: A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend?
34: STEPHANO: Stephano is my name; and I bring word
35: My mistress will before the break of day
36: Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about
37: By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
38: For happy wedlock hours.
39: LORENZO: Who comes with her?
40: STEPHANO: None but a holy hermit and her maid.
41: I pray you, is my master yet return'd?
42: LORENZO: He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
43: But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,
44: And ceremoniously let us prepare
45: Some welcome for the mistress of the house.
46: LAUNCELOT: Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!
47: LORENZO: Who calls?
48: LAUNCELOT: Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo?
49: Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!
50: LORENZO: Leave hollaing, man: here.
51: LAUNCELOT: Sola! where? where?
52: LORENZO: Here.
53: LAUNCELOT: Tell him there's a post come from my master, with
54: his horn full of good news: my master will be here
55: ere morning.
56: LORENZO: Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.
57: And yet no matter: why should we go in?
58: My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,
59: Within the house, your mistress is at hand;
60: And bring your music forth into the air.
61: How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
62: Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
63: Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night
64: Become the touches of sweet harmony.
65: Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
66: Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:
67: There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
68: But in his motion like an angel sings,
69: Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;
70: Such harmony is in immortal souls;
71: But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
72: Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
73: Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!
74: With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,
75: And draw her home with music.
76: JESSICA: I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
77: LORENZO: The reason is, your spirits are attentive:
78: For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
79: Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
80: Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
81: Which is the hot condition of their blood;
82: If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
83: Or any air of music touch their ears,
84: You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
85: Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
86: By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet
87: Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;
88: Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,
89: But music for the time doth change his nature.
90: The man that hath no music in himself,
91: Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
92: Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;
93: The motions of his spirit are dull as night
94: And his affections dark as Erebus:
95: Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.
96: PORTIA: That light we see is burning in my hall.
97: How far that little candle throws his beams!
98: So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
99: NERISSA: When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.
100: PORTIA: So doth the greater glory dim the less:
101: A substitute shines brightly as a king
102: Unto the king be by, and then his state
103: Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
104: Into the main of waters. Music! hark!
105: NERISSA: It is your music, madam, of the house.
106: PORTIA: Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
107: Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.
108: NERISSA: Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
109: PORTIA: The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,
110: When neither is attended, and I think
111: The nightingale, if she should sing by day,
112: When every goose is cackling, would be thought
113: No better a musician than the wren.
114: How many things by season season'd are
115: To their right praise and true perfection!
116: Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion
117: And would not be awaked.
118: LORENZO: That is the voice,
119: Or I am much deceived, of Portia.
120: PORTIA: He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
121: By the bad voice.
122: LORENZO: Dear lady, welcome home.
123: PORTIA: We have been praying for our husbands' healths,
124: Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.
125: Are they return'd?
126: LORENZO: Madam, they are not yet;
127: But there is come a messenger before,
128: To signify their coming.
129: PORTIA: Go in, Nerissa;
130: Give order to my servants that they take
131: No note at all of our being absent hence;
132: Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.
133: LORENZO: Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:
134: We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not.
135: PORTIA: This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
136: It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,
137: Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
138: BASSANIO: We should hold day with the Antipodes,
139: If you would walk in absence of the sun.
140: PORTIA: Let me give light, but let me not be light;
141: For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,
142: And never be Bassanio so for me:
143: But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.
144: BASSANIO: I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.
145: This is the man, this is Antonio,
146: To whom I am so infinitely bound.
147: PORTIA: You should in all sense be much bound to him.
148: For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.
149: ANTONIO: No more than I am well acquitted of.
150: PORTIA: Sir, you are very welcome to our house:
151: It must appear in other ways than words,
152: Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.
153: GRATIANO: [To NERISSA] By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;
154: In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:
155: Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,
156: Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.
157: PORTIA: A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?
158: GRATIANO: About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
159: That she did give me, whose posy was
160: For all the world like cutler's poetry
161: Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'
162: NERISSA: What talk you of the posy or the value?
163: You swore to me, when I did give it you,
164: That you would wear it till your hour of death
165: And that it should lie with you in your grave:
166: Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
167: You should have been respective and have kept it.
168: Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,
169: The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.
170: GRATIANO: He will, an if he live to be a man.
171: NERISSA: Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
172: GRATIANO: Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
173: A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
174: No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,
175: A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:
176: I could not for my heart deny it him.
177: PORTIA: You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
178: To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:
179: A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
180: And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
181: I gave my love a ring and made him swear
182: Never to part with it; and here he stands;
183: I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
184: Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
185: That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,
186: You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:
187: An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.
188: BASSANIO: [Aside] Why, I were best to cut my left hand off
189: And swear I lost the ring defending it.
190: GRATIANO: My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
191: Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
192: Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
193: That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;
194: And neither man nor master would take aught
195: But the two rings.
196: PORTIA: What ring gave you my lord?
197: Not that, I hope, which you received of me.
198: BASSANIO: If I could add a lie unto a fault,
199: I would deny it; but you see my finger
200: Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.
201: PORTIA: Even so void is your false heart of truth.
202: By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed
203: Until I see the ring.
204: NERISSA: Nor I in yours
205: Till I again see mine.
206: BASSANIO: Sweet Portia,
207: If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
208: If you did know for whom I gave the ring
209: And would conceive for what I gave the ring
210: And how unwillingly I left the ring,
211: When nought would be accepted but the ring,
212: You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
213: PORTIA: If you had known the virtue of the ring,
214: Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
215: Or your own honour to contain the ring,
216: You would not then have parted with the ring.
217: What man is there so much unreasonable,
218: If you had pleased to have defended it
219: With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
220: To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
221: Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
222: I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.
223: BASSANIO: No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
224: No woman had it, but a civil doctor,
225: Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
226: And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him
227: And suffer'd him to go displeased away;
228: Even he that did uphold the very life
229: Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?
230: I was enforced to send it after him;
231: I was beset with shame and courtesy;
232: My honour would not let ingratitude
233: So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;
234: For, by these blessed candles of the night,
235: Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd
236: The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
237: PORTIA: Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:
238: Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
239: And that which you did swear to keep for me,
240: I will become as liberal as you;
241: I'll not deny him any thing I have,
242: No, not my body nor my husband's bed:
243: Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:
244: Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:
245: If you do not, if I be left alone,
246: Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,
247: I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.
248: NERISSA: And I his clerk; therefore be well advised
249: How you do leave me to mine own protection.
250: GRATIANO: Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;
251: For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.
252: ANTONIO: I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.
253: PORTIA: Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.
254: BASSANIO: Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
255: And, in the hearing of these many friends,
256: I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
257: Wherein I see myself--
258: PORTIA: Mark you but that!
259: In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;
260: In each eye, one: swear by your double self,
261: And there's an oath of credit.
262: BASSANIO: Nay, but hear me:
263: Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
264: I never more will break an oath with thee.
265: ANTONIO: I once did lend my body for his wealth;
266: Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,
267: Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,
268: My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
269: Will never more break faith advisedly.
270: PORTIA: Then you shall be his surety. Give him this
271: And bid him keep it better than the other.
272: ANTONIO: Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.
273: BASSANIO: By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
274: PORTIA: I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;
275: For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.
276: NERISSA: And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;
277: For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,
278: In lieu of this last night did lie with me.
279: GRATIANO: Why, this is like the mending of highways
280: In summer, where the ways are fair enough:
281: What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?
282: PORTIA: Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:
283: Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;
284: It comes from Padua, from Bellario:
285: There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,
286: Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here
287: Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
288: And even but now return'd; I have not yet
289: Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;
290: And I have better news in store for you
291: Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
292: There you shall find three of your argosies
293: Are richly come to harbour suddenly:
294: You shall not know by what strange accident
295: I chanced on this letter.
296: ANTONIO: I am dumb.
297: BASSANIO: Were you the doctor and I knew you not?
298: GRATIANO: Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
299: NERISSA: Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
300: Unless he live until he be a man.
301: BASSANIO: Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:
302: When I am absent, then lie with my wife.
303: ANTONIO: Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
304: For here I read for certain that my ships
305: Are safely come to road.
306: PORTIA: How now, Lorenzo!
307: My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
308: NERISSA: Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
309: There do I give to you and Jessica,
310: From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
311: After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.
312: LORENZO: Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
313: Of starved people.
314: PORTIA: It is almost morning,
315: And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
316: Of these events at full. Let us go in;
317: And charge us there upon inter'gatories,
318: And we will answer all things faithfully.
