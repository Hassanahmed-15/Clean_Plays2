ACT 1 SCENE 1

1: KING HENRY IV: So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
2: Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
3: And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
4: To be commenced in strands afar remote.
5: No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
6: Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;
7: Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,
8: Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
9: Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,
10: Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
11: All of one nature, of one substance bred,
12: Did lately meet in the intestine shock
13: And furious close of civil butchery
14: Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
15: March all one way and be no more opposed
16: Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:
17: The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
18: No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
19: As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,
20: Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
21: We are impressed and engaged to fight,
22: Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;
23: Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
24: To chase these pagans in those holy fields
25: Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
26: Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
27: For our advantage on the bitter cross.
28: But this our purpose now is twelve month old,
29: And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
30: Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
31: Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
32: What yesternight our council did decree
33: In forwarding this dear expedience.
34: WESTMORELAND: My liege, this haste was hot in question,
35: And many limits of the charge set down
36: But yesternight: when all athwart there came
37: A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
38: Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,
39: Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
40: Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
41: Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
42: A thousand of his people butchered;
43: Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
44: Such beastly shameless transformation,
45: By those Welshwomen done as may not be
46: Without much shame retold or spoken of.
47: KING HENRY IV: It seems then that the tidings of this broil
48: Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
49: WESTMORELAND: This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;
50: For more uneven and unwelcome news
51: Came from the north and thus it did import:
52: On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,
53: Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,
54: That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
55: At Holmedon met,
56: Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,
57: As by discharge of their artillery,
58: And shape of likelihood, the news was told;
59: For he that brought them, in the very heat
60: And pride of their contention did take horse,
61: Uncertain of the issue any way.
62: KING HENRY IV: Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,
63: Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.
64: Stain'd with the variation of each soil
65: Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;
66: And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
67: The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
68: Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,
69: Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
70: On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took
71: Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son
72: To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,
73: Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:
74: And is not this an honourable spoil?
75: A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?
76: WESTMORELAND: In faith,
77: It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.
78: KING HENRY IV: Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
79: In envy that my Lord Northumberland
80: Should be the father to so blest a son,
81: A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;
82: Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;
83: Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
84: Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
85: See riot and dishonour stain the brow
86: Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved
87: That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
88: In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
89: And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
90: Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
91: But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
92: Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,
93: Which he in this adventure hath surprised,
94: To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,
95: I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.
96: WESTMORELAND: This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,
97: Malevolent to you in all aspects;
98: Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up
99: The crest of youth against your dignity.
100: KING HENRY IV: But I have sent for him to answer this;
101: And for this cause awhile we must neglect
102: Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
103: Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we
104: Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:
105: But come yourself with speed to us again;
106: For more is to be said and to be done
107: Than out of anger can be uttered.
108: WESTMORELAND: I will, my liege.
ACT 1 SCENE 2

1: FALSTAFF: Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?
2: PRINCE HENRY: Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack
3: and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
4: benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to
5: demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
6: What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
7: day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
8: capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
9: signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
10: a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no
11: reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
12: the time of the day.
13: FALSTAFF: Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take
14: purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not
15: by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,
16: I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God
17: save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace
18: thou wilt have none,--
19: PRINCE HENRY: What, none?
20: FALSTAFF: No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to
21: prologue to an egg and butter.
22: PRINCE HENRY: Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.
23: FALSTAFF: Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not
24: us that are squires of the night's body be called
25: thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
26: foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the
27: moon; and let men say we be men of good government,
28: being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and
29: chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.
30: PRINCE HENRY: Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the
31: fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
32: flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,
33: by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold
34: most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
35: dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with
36: swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'
37: now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
38: and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.
39: FALSTAFF: By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my
40: hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
41: PRINCE HENRY: As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And
42: is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
43: FALSTAFF: How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and
44: thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
45: buff jerkin?
46: PRINCE HENRY: Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?
47: FALSTAFF: Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
48: time and oft.
49: PRINCE HENRY: Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
50: FALSTAFF: No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.
51: PRINCE HENRY: Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;
52: and where it would not, I have used my credit.
53: FALSTAFF: Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent
54: that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet
55: wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when
56: thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
57: with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
58: not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.
59: PRINCE HENRY: No; thou shalt.
60: FALSTAFF: Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.
61: PRINCE HENRY: Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have
62: the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.
63: FALSTAFF: Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my
64: humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell
65: you.
66: PRINCE HENRY: For obtaining of suits?
67: FALSTAFF: Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman
68: hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy
69: as a gib cat or a lugged bear.
70: PRINCE HENRY: Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.
71: FALSTAFF: Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.
72: PRINCE HENRY: What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of
73: Moor-ditch?
74: FALSTAFF: Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
75: the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young
76: prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more
77: with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
78: commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
79: lord of the council rated me the other day in the
80: street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet
81: he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and
82: yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.
83: PRINCE HENRY: Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the
84: streets, and no man regards it.
85: FALSTAFF: O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
86: to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
87: me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew
88: thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man
89: should speak truly, little better than one of the
90: wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give
91: it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:
92: I'll be damned for never a king's son in
93: Christendom.
94: PRINCE HENRY: Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?
95: FALSTAFF: 'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I
96: do not, call me villain and baffle me.
97: PRINCE HENRY: I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying
98: to purse-taking.
99: FALSTAFF: Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a
100: man to labour in his vocation.
101: Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
102: match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what
103: hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
104: most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to
105: a true man.
106: PRINCE HENRY: Good morrow, Ned.
107: POINS: Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?
108: what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how
109: agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou
110: soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
111: and a cold capon's leg?
112: PRINCE HENRY: Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have
113: his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of
114: proverbs: he will give the devil his due.
115: POINS: Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.
116: PRINCE HENRY: Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.
117: POINS: But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four
118: o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going
119: to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders
120: riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards
121: for you all; you have horses for yourselves:
122: Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
123: supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it
124: as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff
125: your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry
126: at home and be hanged.
127: FALSTAFF: Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,
128: I'll hang you for going.
129: POINS: You will, chops?
130: FALSTAFF: Hal, wilt thou make one?
131: PRINCE HENRY: Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.
132: FALSTAFF: There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good
133: fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood
134: royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.
135: PRINCE HENRY: Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.
136: FALSTAFF: Why, that's well said.
137: PRINCE HENRY: Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.
138: FALSTAFF: By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.
139: PRINCE HENRY: I care not.
140: POINS: Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:
141: I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
142: that he shall go.
143: FALSTAFF: Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him
144: the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may
145: move and what he hears may be believed, that the
146: true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false
147: thief; for the poor abuses of the time want
148: countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.
149: PRINCE HENRY: Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!
150: POINS: Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us
151: to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot
152: manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill
153: shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:
154: yourself and I will not be there; and when they
155: have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut
156: this head off from my shoulders.
157: PRINCE HENRY: How shall we part with them in setting forth?
158: POINS: Why, we will set forth before or after them, and
159: appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at
160: our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure
161: upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have
162: no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.
163: PRINCE HENRY: Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our
164: horses, by our habits and by every other
165: appointment, to be ourselves.
166: POINS: Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them
167: in the wood; our vizards we will change after we
168: leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram
169: for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.
170: PRINCE HENRY: Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.
171: POINS: Well, for two of them, I know them to be as
172: true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the
173: third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll
174: forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the
175: incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
176: tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at
177: least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what
178: extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this
179: lies the jest.
180: PRINCE HENRY: Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things
181: necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;
182: there I'll sup. Farewell.
183: POINS: Farewell, my lord.
184: PRINCE HENRY: I know you all, and will awhile uphold
185: The unyoked humour of your idleness:
186: Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
187: Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
188: To smother up his beauty from the world,
189: That, when he please again to be himself,
190: Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,
191: By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
192: Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
193: If all the year were playing holidays,
194: To sport would be as tedious as to work;
195: But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,
196: And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
197: So, when this loose behavior I throw off
198: And pay the debt I never promised,
199: By how much better than my word I am,
200: By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;
201: And like bright metal on a sullen ground,
202: My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,
203: Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
204: Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
205: I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;
206: Redeeming time when men think least I will.
ACT 1 SCENE 3

1: KING HENRY IV: My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
2: Unapt to stir at these indignities,
3: And you have found me; for accordingly
4: You tread upon my patience: but be sure
5: I will from henceforth rather be myself,
6: Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition;
7: Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,
8: And therefore lost that title of respect
9: Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.
10: EARL OF WORCESTER: Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves
11: The scourge of greatness to be used on it;
12: And that same greatness too which our own hands
13: Have holp to make so portly.
14: NORTHUMBERLAND: My lord.--
15: KING HENRY IV: Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see
16: Danger and disobedience in thine eye:
17: O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
18: And majesty might never yet endure
19: The moody frontier of a servant brow.
20: You have good leave to leave us: when we need
21: Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.
22: You were about to speak.
23: NORTHUMBERLAND: Yea, my good lord.
24: Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,
25: Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,
26: Were, as he says, not with such strength denied
27: As is deliver'd to your majesty:
28: Either envy, therefore, or misprison
29: Is guilty of this fault and not my son.
30: HOTSPUR: My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
31: But I remember, when the fight was done,
32: When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
33: Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
34: Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,
35: Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd
36: Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;
37: He was perfumed like a milliner;
38: And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
39: A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
40: He gave his nose and took't away again;
41: Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
42: Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,
43: And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
44: He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
45: To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
46: Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
47: With many holiday and lady terms
48: He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded
49: My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
50: I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,
51: To be so pester'd with a popinjay,
52: Out of my grief and my impatience,
53: Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,
54: He should or he should not; for he made me mad
55: To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
56: And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
57: Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--
58: And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
59: Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
60: And that it was great pity, so it was,
61: This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd
62: Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
63: Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
64: So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
65: He would himself have been a soldier.
66: This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,
67: I answer'd indirectly, as I said;
68: And I beseech you, let not his report
69: Come current for an accusation
70: Betwixt my love and your high majesty.
71: SIR WALTER BLUNT: The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,
72: Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said
73: To such a person and in such a place,
74: At such a time, with all the rest retold,
75: May reasonably die and never rise
76: To do him wrong or any way impeach
77: What then he said, so he unsay it now.
78: KING HENRY IV: Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,
79: But with proviso and exception,
80: That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
81: His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;
82: Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd
83: The lives of those that he did lead to fight
84: Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,
85: Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March
86: Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,
87: Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
88: Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,
89: When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
90: No, on the barren mountains let him starve;
91: For I shall never hold that man my friend
92: Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
93: To ransom home revolted Mortimer.
94: HOTSPUR: Revolted Mortimer!
95: He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
96: But by the chance of war; to prove that true
97: Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
98: Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took
99: When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,
100: In single opposition, hand to hand,
101: He did confound the best part of an hour
102: In changing hardiment with great Glendower:
103: Three times they breathed and three times did
104: they drink,
105: Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
106: Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
107: Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,
108: And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
109: Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.
110: Never did base and rotten policy
111: Colour her working with such deadly wounds;
112: Nor could the noble Mortimer
113: Receive so many, and all willingly:
114: Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.
115: KING HENRY IV: Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;
116: He never did encounter with Glendower:
117: I tell thee,
118: He durst as well have met the devil alone
119: As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
120: Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
121: Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:
122: Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,
123: Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
124: As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,
125: We licence your departure with your son.
126: Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.
127: HOTSPUR: An if the devil come and roar for them,
128: I will not send them: I will after straight
129: And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,
130: Albeit I make a hazard of my head.
131: NORTHUMBERLAND: What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:
132: Here comes your uncle.
133: HOTSPUR: Speak of Mortimer!
134: 'Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul
135: Want mercy, if I do not join with him:
136: Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
137: And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,
138: But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
139: As high in the air as this unthankful king,
140: As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.
141: NORTHUMBERLAND: Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.
142: EARL OF WORCESTER: Who struck this heat up after I was gone?
143: HOTSPUR: He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;
144: And when I urged the ransom once again
145: Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
146: And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,
147: Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.
148: EARL OF WORCESTER: I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd
149: By Richard that dead is the next of blood?
150: NORTHUMBERLAND: He was; I heard the proclamation:
151: And then it was when the unhappy king,
152: --Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth
153: Upon his Irish expedition;
154: From whence he intercepted did return
155: To be deposed and shortly murdered.
156: EARL OF WORCESTER: And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
157: Live scandalized and foully spoken of.
158: HOTSPUR: But soft, I pray you; did King Richard then
159: Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
160: Heir to the crown?
161: NORTHUMBERLAND: He did; myself did hear it.
162: HOTSPUR: Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,
163: That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
164: But shall it be that you, that set the crown
165: Upon the head of this forgetful man
166: And for his sake wear the detested blot
167: Of murderous subornation, shall it be,
168: That you a world of curses undergo,
169: Being the agents, or base second means,
170: The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?
171: O, pardon me that I descend so low,
172: To show the line and the predicament
173: Wherein you range under this subtle king;
174: Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
175: Or fill up chronicles in time to come,
176: That men of your nobility and power
177: Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,
178: As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,
179: To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,
180: An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?
181: And shall it in more shame be further spoken,
182: That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off
183: By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
184: No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem
185: Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
186: Into the good thoughts of the world again,
187: Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
188: Of this proud king, who studies day and night
189: To answer all the debt he owes to you
190: Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:
191: Therefore, I say--
192: EARL OF WORCESTER: Peace, cousin, say no more:
193: And now I will unclasp a secret book,
194: And to your quick-conceiving discontents
195: I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,
196: As full of peril and adventurous spirit
197: As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud
198: On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
199: HOTSPUR: If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:
200: Send danger from the east unto the west,
201: So honour cross it from the north to south,
202: And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs
203: To rouse a lion than to start a hare!
204: NORTHUMBERLAND: Imagination of some great exploit
205: Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.
206: HOTSPUR: By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,
207: To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,
208: Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
209: Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,
210: And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;
211: So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
212: Without corrival, all her dignities:
213: But out upon this half-faced fellowship!
214: EARL OF WORCESTER: He apprehends a world of figures here,
215: But not the form of what he should attend.
216: Good cousin, give me audience for a while.
217: HOTSPUR: I cry you mercy.
218: EARL OF WORCESTER: Those same noble Scots
219: That are your prisoners,--
220: HOTSPUR: I'll keep them all;
221: By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;
222: No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:
223: I'll keep them, by this hand.
224: EARL OF WORCESTER: You start away
225: And lend no ear unto my purposes.
226: Those prisoners you shall keep.
227: HOTSPUR: Nay, I will; that's flat:
228: He said he would not ransom Mortimer;
229: Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;
230: But I will find him when he lies asleep,
231: And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'
232: Nay,
233: I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
234: Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him
235: To keep his anger still in motion.
236: EARL OF WORCESTER: Hear you, cousin; a word.
237: HOTSPUR: All studies here I solemnly defy,
238: Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:
239: And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,
240: But that I think his father loves him not
241: And would be glad he met with some mischance,
242: I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.
243: EARL OF WORCESTER: Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you
244: When you are better temper'd to attend.
245: NORTHUMBERLAND: Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
246: Art thou to break into this woman's mood,
247: Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!
248: HOTSPUR: Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,
249: Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear
250: Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.
251: In Richard's time,--what do you call the place?--
252: A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire;
253: 'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,
254: His uncle York; where I first bow'd my knee
255: Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,--
256: 'Sblood!--
257: When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.
258: NORTHUMBERLAND: At Berkley castle.
259: HOTSPUR: You say true:
260: Why, what a candy deal of courtesy
261: This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!
262: Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,'
263: And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin;'
264: O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!
265: Good uncle, tell your tale; I have done.
266: EARL OF WORCESTER: Nay, if you have not, to it again;
267: We will stay your leisure.
268: HOTSPUR: I have done, i' faith.
269: EARL OF WORCESTER: Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.
270: Deliver them up without their ransom straight,
271: And make the Douglas' son your only mean
272: For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons
273: Which I shall send you written, be assured,
274: Will easily be granted. You, my lord,
275: Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,
276: Shall secretly into the bosom creep
277: Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,
278: The archbishop.
279: HOTSPUR: Of York, is it not?
280: EARL OF WORCESTER: True; who bears hard
281: His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.
282: I speak not this in estimation,
283: As what I think might be, but what I know
284: Is ruminated, plotted and set down,
285: And only stays but to behold the face
286: Of that occasion that shall bring it on.
287: HOTSPUR: I smell it: upon my life, it will do well.
288: NORTHUMBERLAND: Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip.
289: HOTSPUR: Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot;
290: And then the power of Scotland and of York,
291: To join with Mortimer, ha?
292: EARL OF WORCESTER: And so they shall.
293: HOTSPUR: In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd.
294: EARL OF WORCESTER: And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,
295: To save our heads by raising of a head;
296: For, bear ourselves as even as we can,
297: The king will always think him in our debt,
298: And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,
299: Till he hath found a time to pay us home:
300: And see already how he doth begin
301: To make us strangers to his looks of love.
302: HOTSPUR: He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him.
303: EARL OF WORCESTER: Cousin, farewell: no further go in this
304: Than I by letters shall direct your course.
305: When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,
306: I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;
307: Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,
308: As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,
309: To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,
310: Which now we hold at much uncertainty.
311: NORTHUMBERLAND: Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust.
ACT 2 SCENE 1

1: First Carrier: Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day, I'll be
2: hanged: Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and
3: yet our horse not packed. What, ostler!
4: Ostler: [Within] Anon, anon.
5: First Carrier: I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle, put a few flocks
6: in the point; poor jade, is wrung in the withers out
7: of all cess.
8: Second Carrier: Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that
9: is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this
10: house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.
11: First Carrier: Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of oats
12: rose; it was the death of him.
13: Second Carrier: I think this be the most villanous house in all
14: London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench.
15: First Carrier: Like a tench! by the mass, there is ne'er a king
16: christen could be better bit than I have been since
17: the first cock.
18: Second Carrier: Why, they will allow us ne'er a jordan, and then we
19: leak in your chimney; and your chamber-lie breeds
20: fleas like a loach.
21: First Carrier: What, ostler! come away and be hanged!
22: Second Carrier: I have a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,
23: to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.
24: First Carrier: God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite
25: starved. What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou
26: never an eye in thy head? canst not hear? An
27: 'twere not as good deed as drink, to break the pate
28: on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hanged!
29: hast thou no faith in thee?
30: GADSHILL: Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?
31: First Carrier: I think it be two o'clock.
32: GADSHILL: I pray thee lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding
33: in the stable.
34: First Carrier: Nay, by God, soft; I know a trick worth two of that, i' faith.
35: GADSHILL: I pray thee, lend me thine.
36: Second Carrier: Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth
37: he? marry, I'll see thee hanged first.
38: GADSHILL: Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?
39: Second Carrier: Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant
40: thee. Come, neighbour Mugs, we'll call up the
41: gentleman: they will along with company, for they
42: have great charge.
43: GADSHILL: What, ho! chamberlain!
44: Chamberlain: [Within] At hand, quoth pick-purse.
45: GADSHILL: That's even as fair as--at hand, quoth the
46: chamberlain; for thou variest no more from picking
47: of purses than giving direction doth from labouring;
48: thou layest the plot how.
49: Chamberlain: Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that
50: I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the
51: wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with
52: him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his
53: company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one
54: that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.
55: They are up already, and call for eggs and butter;
56: they will away presently.
57: GADSHILL: Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas'
58: clerks, I'll give thee this neck.
59: Chamberlain: No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the
60: hangman; for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas
61: as truly as a man of falsehood may.
62: GADSHILL: What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,
63: I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old
64: Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no
65: starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou
66: dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are
67: content to do the profession some grace; that would,
68: if matters should be looked into, for their own
69: credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no
70: foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,
71: none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms;
72: but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and
73: great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will
74: strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than
75: drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,
76: I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the
77: commonwealth; or rather, not pray to her, but prey
78: on her, for they ride up and down on her and make
79: her their boots.
80: Chamberlain: What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold
81: out water in foul way?
82: GADSHILL: She will, she will; justice hath liquored her. We
83: steal as in a castle, cocksure; we have the receipt
84: of fern-seed, we walk invisible.
85: Chamberlain: Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to
86: the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.
87: GADSHILL: Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in our
88: purchase, as I am a true man.
89: Chamberlain: Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.
90: GADSHILL: Go to; 'homo' is a common name to all men. Bid the
91: ostler bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell,
92: you muddy knave.
ACT 2 SCENE 2

1: POINS: Come, shelter, shelter: I have removed Falstaff's
2: horse, and he frets like a gummed velvet.
3: PRINCE HENRY: Stand close.
4: FALSTAFF: Poins! Poins, and be hanged! Poins!
5: PRINCE HENRY: Peace, ye fat-kidneyed rascal! what a brawling dost
6: thou keep!
7: FALSTAFF: Where's Poins, Hal?
8: PRINCE HENRY: He is walked up to the top of the hill: I'll go seek him.
9: FALSTAFF: I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the
10: rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know
11: not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier
12: further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt
13: not but to die a fair death for all this, if I
14: 'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have
15: forsworn his company hourly any time this two and
16: twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the
17: rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me
18: medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged; it
19: could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!
20: Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!
21: I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere
22: not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man and to
23: leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that
24: ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven
25: ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me;
26: and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:
27: a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!
28: Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you
29: rogues; give me my horse, and be hanged!
30: PRINCE HENRY: Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
31: to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread
32: of travellers.
33: FALSTAFF: Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down?
34: 'Sblood, I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot
35: again for all the coin in thy father's exchequer.
36: What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?
37: PRINCE HENRY: Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.
38: FALSTAFF: I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse,
39: good king's son.
40: PRINCE HENRY: Out, ye rogue! shall I be your ostler?
41: FALSTAFF: Go, hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent
42: garters! If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I
43: have not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy
44: tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison: when a jest
45: is so forward, and afoot too! I hate it.
46: GADSHILL: Stand.
47: FALSTAFF: So I do, against my will.
48: POINS: O, 'tis our setter: I know his voice. Bardolph,
49: what news?
50: BARDOLPH: Case ye, case ye; on with your vizards: there 's
51: money of the king's coming down the hill; 'tis going
52: to the king's exchequer.
53: FALSTAFF: You lie, ye rogue; 'tis going to the king's tavern.
54: GADSHILL: There's enough to make us all.
55: FALSTAFF: To be hanged.
56: PRINCE HENRY: Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane;
57: Ned Poins and I will walk lower: if they 'scape
58: from your encounter, then they light on us.
59: PETO: How many be there of them?
60: GADSHILL: Some eight or ten.
61: FALSTAFF: 'Zounds, will they not rob us?
62: PRINCE HENRY: What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?
63: FALSTAFF: Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather;
64: but yet no coward, Hal.
65: PRINCE HENRY: Well, we leave that to the proof.
66: POINS: Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:
67: when thou needest him, there thou shalt find him.
68: Farewell, and stand fast.
69: FALSTAFF: Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hanged.
70: PRINCE HENRY: Ned, where are our disguises?
71: POINS: Here, hard by: stand close.
72: FALSTAFF: Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I:
73: every man to his business.
74: First Traveller: Come, neighbour: the boy shall lead our horses down
75: the hill; we'll walk afoot awhile, and ease our legs.
76: Thieves: Stand!
77: Travellers: Jesus bless us!
78: FALSTAFF: Strike; down with them; cut the villains' throats:
79: ah! whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they
80: hate us youth: down with them: fleece them.
81: Travellers: O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever!
82: FALSTAFF: Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye
83: fat chuffs: I would your store were here! On,
84: bacons, on! What, ye knaves! young men must live.
85: You are Grand-jurors, are ye? we'll jure ye, 'faith.
86: PRINCE HENRY: The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou
87: and I rob the thieves and go merrily to London, it
88: would be argument for a week, laughter for a month
89: and a good jest for ever.
90: POINS: Stand close; I hear them coming.
91: FALSTAFF: Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse
92: before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two
93: arrant cowards, there's no equity stirring: there's
94: no more valour in that Poins than in a wild-duck.
95: PRINCE HENRY: Your money!
96: POINS: Villains!
97: PRINCE HENRY: Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:
98: The thieves are all scatter'd and possess'd with fear
99: So strongly that they dare not meet each other;
100: Each takes his fellow for an officer.
101: Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death,
102: And lards the lean earth as he walks along:
103: Were 't not for laughing, I should pity him.
104: POINS: How the rogue roar'd!
ACT 2 SCENE 3

1: HOTSPUR: 'But for mine own part, my lord, I could be well
2: contented to be there, in respect of the love I bear
3: your house.' He could be contented: why is he not,
4: then? In respect of the love he bears our house:
5: he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than
6: he loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The
7: purpose you undertake is dangerous;'--why, that's
8: certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to
9: drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this
10: nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The
11: purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you
12: have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and
13: your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so
14: great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so? I say
15: unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and
16: you lie. What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord,
17: our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our
18: friends true and constant: a good plot, good
19: friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot,
20: very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is
21: this! Why, my lord of York commends the plot and the
22: general course of action. 'Zounds, an I were now by
23: this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan.
24: Is there not my father, my uncle and myself? lord
25: Edmund Mortimer, My lord of York and Owen Glendower?
26: is there not besides the Douglas? have I not all
27: their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the
28: next month? and are they not some of them set
29: forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an
30: infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity
31: of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay
32: open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself
33: and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of
34: skim milk with so honourable an action! Hang him!
35: let him tell the king: we are prepared. I will set
36: forward to-night.
37: How now, Kate! I must leave you within these two hours.
38: LADY PERCY: O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?
39: For what offence have I this fortnight been
40: A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?
41: Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee
42: Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep?
43: Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,
44: And start so often when thou sit'st alone?
45: Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;
46: And given my treasures and my rights of thee
47: To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?
48: In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,
49: And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;
50: Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;
51: Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd
52: Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,
53: Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,
54: Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,
55: Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,
56: And all the currents of a heady fight.
57: Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war
58: And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,
59: That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
60: Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;
61: And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,
62: Such as we see when men restrain their breath
63: On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?
64: Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,
65: And I must know it, else he loves me not.
66: HOTSPUR: What, ho!
67: Is Gilliams with the packet gone?
68: Servant: He is, my lord, an hour ago.
69: HOTSPUR: Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?
70: Servant: One horse, my lord, he brought even now.
71: HOTSPUR: What horse? a roan, a crop-ear, is it not?
72: Servant: It is, my lord.
73: HOTSPUR: That roan shall by my throne.
74: Well, I will back him straight: O esperance!
75: Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.
76: LADY PERCY: But hear you, my lord.
77: HOTSPUR: What say'st thou, my lady?
78: LADY PERCY: What is it carries you away?
79: HOTSPUR: Why, my horse, my love, my horse.
80: LADY PERCY: Out, you mad-headed ape!
81: A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
82: As you are toss'd with. In faith,
83: I'll know your business, Harry, that I will.
84: I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir
85: About his title, and hath sent for you
86: To line his enterprise: but if you go,--
87: HOTSPUR: So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.
88: LADY PERCY: Come, come, you paraquito, answer me
89: Directly unto this question that I ask:
90: In faith, I'll break thy little finger, Harry,
91: An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.
92: HOTSPUR: Away,
93: Away, you trifler! Love! I love thee not,
94: I care not for thee, Kate: this is no world
95: To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:
96: We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,
97: And pass them current too. God's me, my horse!
98: What say'st thou, Kate? what would'st thou
99: have with me?
100: LADY PERCY: Do you not love me? do you not, indeed?
101: Well, do not then; for since you love me not,
102: I will not love myself. Do you not love me?
103: Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.
104: HOTSPUR: Come, wilt thou see me ride?
105: And when I am on horseback, I will swear
106: I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate;
107: I must not have you henceforth question me
108: Whither I go, nor reason whereabout:
109: Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,
110: This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.
111: I know you wise, but yet no farther wise
112: Than Harry Percy's wife: constant you are,
113: But yet a woman: and for secrecy,
114: No lady closer; for I well believe
115: Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know;
116: And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.
117: LADY PERCY: How! so far?
118: HOTSPUR: Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:
119: Whither I go, thither shall you go too;
120: To-day will I set forth, to-morrow you.
121: Will this content you, Kate?
122: LADY PERCY: It must of force.
ACT 2 SCENE 4

1: PRINCE HENRY: Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me
2: thy hand to laugh a little.
3: POINS: Where hast been, Hal?
4: PRINCE HENRY: With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four
5: score hogsheads. I have sounded the very
6: base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother
7: to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by
8: their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.
9: They take it already upon their salvation, that
10: though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king
11: of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,
12: like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a
13: good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I
14: am king of England, I shall command all the good
15: lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing
16: scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they
17: cry 'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I
18: am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,
19: that I can drink with any tinker in his own language
20: during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost
21: much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet
22: action. But, sweet Ned,--to sweeten which name of
23: Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped
24: even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that
25: never spake other English in his life than 'Eight
26: shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with
27: this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint
28: of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to
29: drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,
30: do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my
31: puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do
32: thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale
33: to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and
34: I'll show thee a precedent.
35: POINS: Francis!
36: PRINCE HENRY: Thou art perfect.
37: POINS: Francis!
38: FRANCIS: Anon, anon, sir. Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph.
39: PRINCE HENRY: Come hither, Francis.
40: FRANCIS: My lord?
41: PRINCE HENRY: How long hast thou to serve, Francis?
42: FRANCIS: Forsooth, five years, and as much as to--
43: POINS: [Within] Francis!
44: FRANCIS: Anon, anon, sir.
45: PRINCE HENRY: Five year! by'r lady, a long lease for the clinking
46: of pewter. But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant
47: as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it
48: a fair pair of heels and run from it?
49: FRANCIS: O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn upon all the books in
50: England, I could find in my heart.
51: POINS: [Within] Francis!
52: FRANCIS: Anon, sir.
53: PRINCE HENRY: How old art thou, Francis?
54: FRANCIS: Let me see--about Michaelmas next I shall be--
55: POINS: [Within] Francis!
56: FRANCIS: Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord.
57: PRINCE HENRY: Nay, but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou
58: gavest me,'twas a pennyworth, wast't not?
59: FRANCIS: O Lord, I would it had been two!
60: PRINCE HENRY: I will give thee for it a thousand pound: ask me
61: when thou wilt, and thou shalt have it.
62: POINS: [Within] Francis!
63: FRANCIS: Anon, anon.
64: PRINCE HENRY: Anon, Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis;
65: or, Francis, o' Thursday; or indeed, Francis, when
66: thou wilt. But, Francis!
67: FRANCIS: My lord?
68: PRINCE HENRY: Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button,
69: not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter,
70: smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,--
71: FRANCIS: O Lord, sir, who do you mean?
72: PRINCE HENRY: Why, then, your brown bastard is your only drink;
73: for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet
74: will sully: in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much.
75: FRANCIS: What, sir?
76: POINS: [Within] Francis!
77: PRINCE HENRY: Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them call?
78: Vintner: What, standest thou still, and hearest such a
79: calling? Look to the guests within.
80: My lord, old Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are
81: at the door: shall I let them in?
82: PRINCE HENRY: Let them alone awhile, and then open the door.
83: Poins!
84: POINS: Anon, anon, sir.
85: PRINCE HENRY: Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at
86: the door: shall we be merry?
87: POINS: As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what
88: cunning match have you made with this jest of the
89: drawer? come, what's the issue?
90: PRINCE HENRY: I am now of all humours that have showed themselves
91: humours since the old days of goodman Adam to the
92: pupil age of this present twelve o'clock at midnight.
93: What's o'clock, Francis?
94: FRANCIS: Anon, anon, sir.
95: PRINCE HENRY: That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a
96: parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is
97: upstairs and downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of
98: a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's mind, the
99: Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or
100: seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his
101: hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon this quiet
102: life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she,
103: 'how many hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan
104: horse a drench,' says he; and answers 'Some
105: fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I
106: prithee, call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and
107: that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his
108: wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow.
109: POINS: Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been?
110: FALSTAFF: A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too!
111: marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I
112: lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend
113: them and foot them too. A plague of all cowards!
114: Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?
115: PRINCE HENRY: Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?
116: pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale
117: of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound.
118: FALSTAFF: You rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is
119: nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man:
120: yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime
121: in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack;
122: die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be
123: not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a
124: shotten herring. There live not three good men
125: unhanged in England; and one of them is fat and
126: grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say.
127: I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any
128: thing. A plague of all cowards, I say still.
129: PRINCE HENRY: How now, wool-sack! what mutter you?
130: FALSTAFF: A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy
131: kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy
132: subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese,
133: I'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales!
134: PRINCE HENRY: Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?
135: FALSTAFF: Are not you a coward? answer me to that: and Poins there?
136: POINS: 'Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the
137: Lord, I'll stab thee.
138: FALSTAFF: I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call
139: thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I
140: could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight
141: enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your
142: back: call you that backing of your friends? A
143: plague upon such backing! give me them that will
144: face me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I
145: drunk to-day.
146: PRINCE HENRY: O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou
147: drunkest last.
148: FALSTAFF: All's one for that.
149: A plague of all cowards, still say I.
150: PRINCE HENRY: What's the matter?
151: FALSTAFF: What's the matter! there be four of us here have
152: ta'en a thousand pound this day morning.
153: PRINCE HENRY: Where is it, Jack? where is it?
154: FALSTAFF: Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon
155: poor four of us.
156: PRINCE HENRY: What, a hundred, man?
157: FALSTAFF: I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a
158: dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by
159: miracle. I am eight times thrust through the
160: doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut
161: through and through; my sword hacked like a
162: hand-saw--ecce signum! I never dealt better since
163: I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all
164: cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or
165: less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.
166: PRINCE HENRY: Speak, sirs; how was it?
167: GADSHILL: We four set upon some dozen--
168: FALSTAFF: Sixteen at least, my lord.
169: GADSHILL: And bound them.
170: PETO: No, no, they were not bound.
171: FALSTAFF: You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I
172: am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.
173: GADSHILL: As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us--
174: FALSTAFF: And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.
175: PRINCE HENRY: What, fought you with them all?
176: FALSTAFF: All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought
177: not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if
178: there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old
179: Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.
180: PRINCE HENRY: Pray God you have not murdered some of them.
181: FALSTAFF: Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two
182: of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues
183: in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell
184: thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou
185: knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my
186: point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--
187: PRINCE HENRY: What, four? thou saidst but two even now.
188: FALSTAFF: Four, Hal; I told thee four.
189: POINS: Ay, ay, he said four.
190: FALSTAFF: These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at
191: me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven
192: points in my target, thus.
193: PRINCE HENRY: Seven? why, there were but four even now.
194: FALSTAFF: In buckram?
195: POINS: Ay, four, in buckram suits.
196: FALSTAFF: Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.
197: PRINCE HENRY: Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.
198: FALSTAFF: Dost thou hear me, Hal?
199: PRINCE HENRY: Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.
200: FALSTAFF: Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine
201: in buckram that I told thee of--
202: PRINCE HENRY: So, two more already.
203: FALSTAFF: Their points being broken,--
204: POINS: Down fell their hose.
205: FALSTAFF: Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,
206: came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of
207: the eleven I paid.
208: PRINCE HENRY: O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!
209: FALSTAFF: But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten
210: knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
211: at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst
212: not see thy hand.
213: PRINCE HENRY: These lies are like their father that begets them;
214: gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou
215: clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou
216: whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,--
217: FALSTAFF: What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth
218: the truth?
219: PRINCE HENRY: Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal
220: green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy
221: hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?
222: POINS: Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.
223: FALSTAFF: What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the
224: strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would
225: not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on
226: compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as
227: blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon
228: compulsion, I.
229: PRINCE HENRY: I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine
230: coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,
231: this huge hill of flesh,--
232: FALSTAFF: 'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried
233: neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O
234: for breath to utter what is like thee! you
235: tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase; you vile
236: standing-tuck,--
237: PRINCE HENRY: Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and
238: when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,
239: hear me speak but this.
240: POINS: Mark, Jack.
241: PRINCE HENRY: We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and
242: were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain
243: tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you
244: four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your
245: prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in
246: the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts
247: away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared
248: for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard
249: bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword
250: as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!
251: What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst
252: thou now find out to hide thee from this open and
253: apparent shame?
254: POINS: Come, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?
255: FALSTAFF: By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.
256: Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the
257: heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?
258: why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but
259: beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true
260: prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a
261: coward on instinct. I shall think the better of
262: myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant
263: lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,
264: lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap
265: to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.
266: Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles
267: of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be
268: merry? shall we have a play extempore?
269: PRINCE HENRY: Content; and the argument shall be thy running away.
270: FALSTAFF: Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!
271: Hostess: O Jesu, my lord the prince!
272: PRINCE HENRY: How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to
273: me?
274: Hostess: Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at
275: door would speak with you: he says he comes from
276: your father.
277: PRINCE HENRY: Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and
278: send him back again to my mother.
279: FALSTAFF: What manner of man is he?
280: Hostess: An old man.
281: FALSTAFF: What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall
282: I give him his answer?
283: PRINCE HENRY: Prithee, do, Jack.
284: FALSTAFF: 'Faith, and I'll send him packing.
285: PRINCE HENRY: Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair; so did you,
286: Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you
287: ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true
288: prince; no, fie!
289: BARDOLPH: 'Faith, I ran when I saw others run.
290: PRINCE HENRY: 'Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's
291: sword so hacked?
292: PETO: Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would
293: swear truth out of England but he would make you
294: believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.
295: BARDOLPH: Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to
296: make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments
297: with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I
298: did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed
299: to hear his monstrous devices.
300: PRINCE HENRY: O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years
301: ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since
302: thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and
303: sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what
304: instinct hadst thou for it?
305: BARDOLPH: My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold
306: these exhalations?
307: PRINCE HENRY: I do.
308: BARDOLPH: What think you they portend?
309: PRINCE HENRY: Hot livers and cold purses.
310: BARDOLPH: Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.
311: PRINCE HENRY: No, if rightly taken, halter.
312: Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone.
313: How now, my sweet creature of bombast!
314: How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?
315: FALSTAFF: My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was
316: not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have
317: crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of
318: sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a
319: bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was
320: Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the
321: court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the
322: north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the
323: bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the
324: devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh
325: hook--what a plague call you him?
326: POINS: O, Glendower.
327: FALSTAFF: Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,
328: and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of
329: Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill
330: perpendicular,--
331: PRINCE HENRY: He that rides at high speed and with his pistol
332: kills a sparrow flying.
333: FALSTAFF: You have hit it.
334: PRINCE HENRY: So did he never the sparrow.
335: FALSTAFF: Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run.
336: PRINCE HENRY: Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so
337: for running!
338: FALSTAFF: O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot.
339: PRINCE HENRY: Yes, Jack, upon instinct.
340: FALSTAFF: I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,
341: and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:
342: Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's
343: beard is turned white with the news: you may buy
344: land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.
345: PRINCE HENRY: Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and
346: this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads
347: as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds.
348: FALSTAFF: By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we
349: shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,
350: art not thou horrible afeard? thou being
351: heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three
352: such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that
353: spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou
354: not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at
355: it?
356: PRINCE HENRY: Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.
357: FALSTAFF: Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou
358: comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.
359: PRINCE HENRY: Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the
360: particulars of my life.
361: FALSTAFF: Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,
362: this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.
363: PRINCE HENRY: Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden
364: sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich
365: crown for a pitiful bald crown!
366: FALSTAFF: Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,
367: now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to
368: make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have
369: wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it
370: in King Cambyses' vein.
371: PRINCE HENRY: Well, here is my leg.
372: FALSTAFF: And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.
373: Hostess: O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!
374: FALSTAFF: Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain.
375: Hostess: O, the father, how he holds his countenance!
376: FALSTAFF: For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;
377: For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.
378: Hostess: O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry
379: players as ever I see!
380: FALSTAFF: Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.
381: Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy
382: time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though
383: the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster
384: it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the
385: sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have
386: partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,
387: but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
388: foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant
389: me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;
390: why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall
391: the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
392: blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall
393: the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a
394: question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,
395: which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
396: many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,
397: as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth
398: the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not
399: speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in
400: pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in
401: woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I
402: have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.
403: PRINCE HENRY: What manner of man, an it like your majesty?
404: FALSTAFF: A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a
405: cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble
406: carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,
407: by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I
408: remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man
409: should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,
410: I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be
411: known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,
412: peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that
413: Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell
414: me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast
415: thou been this month?
416: PRINCE HENRY: Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,
417: and I'll play my father.
418: FALSTAFF: Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so
419: majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by
420: the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.
421: PRINCE HENRY: Well, here I am set.
422: FALSTAFF: And here I stand: judge, my masters.
423: PRINCE HENRY: Now, Harry, whence come you?
424: FALSTAFF: My noble lord, from Eastcheap.
425: PRINCE HENRY: The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.
426: FALSTAFF: 'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle
427: ye for a young prince, i' faith.
428: PRINCE HENRY: Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look
429: on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:
430: there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an
431: old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why
432: dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that
433: bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel
434: of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed
435: cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with
436: the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that
437: grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in
438: years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and
439: drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a
440: capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?
441: wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,
442: but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?
443: FALSTAFF: I would your grace would take me with you: whom
444: means your grace?
445: PRINCE HENRY: That villanous abominable misleader of youth,
446: Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.
447: FALSTAFF: My lord, the man I know.
448: PRINCE HENRY: I know thou dost.
449: FALSTAFF: But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,
450: were to say more than I know. That he is old, the
451: more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but
452: that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,
453: that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,
454: God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a
455: sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if
456: to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine
457: are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,
458: banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack
459: Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,
460: valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,
461: being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him
462: thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's
463: company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.
464: PRINCE HENRY: I do, I will.
465: BARDOLPH: O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most
466: monstrous watch is at the door.
467: FALSTAFF: Out, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much to
468: say in the behalf of that Falstaff.
469: Hostess: O Jesu, my lord, my lord!
470: PRINCE HENRY: Heigh, heigh! the devil rides upon a fiddlestick:
471: what's the matter?
472: Hostess: The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they
473: are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?
474: FALSTAFF: Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of
475: gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,
476: without seeming so.
477: PRINCE HENRY: And thou a natural coward, without instinct.
478: FALSTAFF: I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,
479: so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart
480: as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!
481: I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.
482: PRINCE HENRY: Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up
483: above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good
484: conscience.
485: FALSTAFF: Both which I have had: but their date is out, and
486: therefore I'll hide me.
487: PRINCE HENRY: Call in the sheriff.
488: Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?
489: Sheriff: First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry
490: Hath follow'd certain men unto this house.
491: PRINCE HENRY: What men?
492: Sheriff: One of them is well known, my gracious lord,
493: A gross fat man.
494: Carrier: As fat as butter.
495: PRINCE HENRY: The man, I do assure you, is not here;
496: For I myself at this time have employ'd him.
497: And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee
498: That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,
499: Send him to answer thee, or any man,
500: For any thing he shall be charged withal:
501: And so let me entreat you leave the house.
502: Sheriff: I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen
503: Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.
504: PRINCE HENRY: It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,
505: He shall be answerable; and so farewell.
506: Sheriff: Good night, my noble lord.
507: PRINCE HENRY: I think it is good morrow, is it not?
508: Sheriff: Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.
509: PRINCE HENRY: This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go,
510: call him forth.
511: PETO: Falstaff!--Fast asleep behind the arras, and
512: snorting like a horse.
513: PRINCE HENRY: Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.
514: What hast thou found?
515: PETO: Nothing but papers, my lord.
516: PRINCE HENRY: Let's see what they be: read them.
517: PETO: [Reads] Item, A capon,. . 2s. 2d.
518: Item, Sauce,. . . 4d.
519: Item, Sack, two gallons, 5s. 8d.
520: Item, Anchovies and sack after supper, 2s. 6d.
521: Item, Bread, ob.
522: PRINCE HENRY: O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to
523: this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,
524: keep close; we'll read it at more advantage: there
525: let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the
526: morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place
527: shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a
528: charge of foot; and I know his death will be a
529: march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid
530: back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in
531: the morning; and so, good morrow, Peto.
ACT 3 SCENE 1

1: MORTIMER: These promises are fair, the parties sure,
2: And our induction full of prosperous hope.
3: HOTSPUR: Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,
4: Will you sit down?
5: And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!
6: I have forgot the map.
7: GLENDOWER: No, here it is.
8: Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,
9: For by that name as oft as Lancaster
10: Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with
11: A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
12: HOTSPUR: And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.
13: GLENDOWER: I cannot blame him: at my nativity
14: The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
15: Of burning cressets; and at my birth
16: The frame and huge foundation of the earth
17: Shaked like a coward.
18: HOTSPUR: Why, so it would have done at the same season, if
19: your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself
20: had never been born.
21: GLENDOWER: I say the earth did shake when I was born.
22: HOTSPUR: And I say the earth was not of my mind,
23: If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
24: GLENDOWER: The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.
25: HOTSPUR: O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,
26: And not in fear of your nativity.
27: Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
28: In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth
29: Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
30: By the imprisoning of unruly wind
31: Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,
32: Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
33: Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth
34: Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,
35: In passion shook.
36: GLENDOWER: Cousin, of many men
37: I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave
38: To tell you once again that at my birth
39: The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
40: The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
41: Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.
42: These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;
43: And all the courses of my life do show
44: I am not in the roll of common men.
45: Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea
46: That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,
47: Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?
48: And bring him out that is but woman's son
49: Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
50: And hold me pace in deep experiments.
51: HOTSPUR: I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.
52: I'll to dinner.
53: MORTIMER: Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.
54: GLENDOWER: I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
55: HOTSPUR: Why, so can I, or so can any man;
56: But will they come when you do call for them?
57: GLENDOWER: Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command
58: The devil.
59: HOTSPUR: And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil
60: By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.
61: If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,
62: And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
63: O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!
64: MORTIMER: Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.
65: GLENDOWER: Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
66: Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye
67: And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him
68: Bootless home and weather-beaten back.
69: HOTSPUR: Home without boots, and in foul weather too!
70: How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?
71: GLENDOWER: Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right
72: According to our threefold order ta'en?
73: MORTIMER: The archdeacon hath divided it
74: Into three limits very equally:
75: England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
76: By south and east is to my part assign'd:
77: All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,
78: And all the fertile land within that bound,
79: To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you
80: The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.
81: And our indentures tripartite are drawn;
82: Which being sealed interchangeably,
83: A business that this night may execute,
84: To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I
85: And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
86: To meet your father and the Scottish power,
87: As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.
88: My father Glendower is not ready yet,
89: Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
90: Within that space you may have drawn together
91: Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.
92: GLENDOWER: A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:
93: And in my conduct shall your ladies come;
94: From whom you now must steal and take no leave,
95: For there will be a world of water shed
96: Upon the parting of your wives and you.
97: HOTSPUR: Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,
98: In quantity equals not one of yours:
99: See how this river comes me cranking in,
100: And cuts me from the best of all my land
101: A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
102: I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;
103: And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
104: In a new channel, fair and evenly;
105: It shall not wind with such a deep indent,
106: To rob me of so rich a bottom here.
107: GLENDOWER: Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.
108: MORTIMER: Yea, but
109: Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up
110: With like advantage on the other side;
111: Gelding the opposed continent as much
112: As on the other side it takes from you.
113: EARL OF WORCESTER: Yea, but a little charge will trench him here
114: And on this north side win this cape of land;
115: And then he runs straight and even.
116: HOTSPUR: I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.
117: GLENDOWER: I'll not have it alter'd.
118: HOTSPUR: Will not you?
119: GLENDOWER: No, nor you shall not.
120: HOTSPUR: Who shall say me nay?
121: GLENDOWER: Why, that will I.
122: HOTSPUR: Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.
123: GLENDOWER: I can speak English, lord, as well as you;
124: For I was train'd up in the English court;
125: Where, being but young, I framed to the harp
126: Many an English ditty lovely well
127: And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,
128: A virtue that was never seen in you.
129: HOTSPUR: Marry,
130: And I am glad of it with all my heart:
131: I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
132: Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;
133: I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,
134: Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;
135: And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,
136: Nothing so much as mincing poetry:
137: 'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.
138: GLENDOWER: Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.
139: HOTSPUR: I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land
140: To any well-deserving friend;
141: But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,
142: I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.
143: Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?
144: GLENDOWER: The moon shines fair; you may away by night:
145: I'll haste the writer and withal
146: Break with your wives of your departure hence:
147: I am afraid my daughter will run mad,
148: So much she doteth on her Mortimer.
149: MORTIMER: Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!
150: HOTSPUR: I cannot choose: sometime he angers me
151: With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,
152: Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,
153: And of a dragon and a finless fish,
154: A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
155: A couching lion and a ramping cat,
156: And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
157: As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;
158: He held me last night at least nine hours
159: In reckoning up the several devils' names
160: That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'
161: But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious
162: As a tired horse, a railing wife;
163: Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live
164: With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,
165: Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
166: In any summer-house in Christendom.
167: MORTIMER: In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,
168: Exceedingly well read, and profited
169: In strange concealments, valiant as a lion
170: And as wondrous affable and as bountiful
171: As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?
172: He holds your temper in a high respect
173: And curbs himself even of his natural scope
174: When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:
175: I warrant you, that man is not alive
176: Might so have tempted him as you have done,
177: Without the taste of danger and reproof:
178: But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.
179: EARL OF WORCESTER: In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;
180: And since your coming hither have done enough
181: To put him quite beside his patience.
182: You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:
183: Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--
184: And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--
185: Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,
186: Defect of manners, want of government,
187: Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:
188: The least of which haunting a nobleman
189: Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
190: Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
191: Beguiling them of commendation.
192: HOTSPUR: Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!
193: Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.
194: MORTIMER: This is the deadly spite that angers me;
195: My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.
196: GLENDOWER: My daughter weeps: she will not part with you;
197: She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.
198: MORTIMER: Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy
199: Shall follow in your conduct speedily.
200: GLENDOWER: She is desperate here; a peevish self-wind harlotry,
201: one that no persuasion can do good upon.
202: MORTIMER: I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh
203: Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens
204: I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,
205: In such a parley should I answer thee.
206: I understand thy kisses and thou mine,
207: And that's a feeling disputation:
208: But I will never be a truant, love,
209: Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue
210: Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,
211: Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,
212: With ravishing division, to her lute.
213: GLENDOWER: Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.
214: MORTIMER: O, I am ignorance itself in this!
215: GLENDOWER: She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
216: And rest your gentle head upon her lap,
217: And she will sing the song that pleaseth you
218: And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.
219: Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,
220: Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep
221: As is the difference betwixt day and night
222: The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team
223: Begins his golden progress in the east.
224: MORTIMER: With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:
225: By that time will our book, I think, be drawn
226: GLENDOWER: Do so;
227: And those musicians that shall play to you
228: Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,
229: And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.
230: HOTSPUR: Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,
231: quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.
232: LADY PERCY: Go, ye giddy goose.
233: HOTSPUR: Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;
234: And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.
235: By'r lady, he is a good musician.
236: LADY PERCY: Then should you be nothing but musical for you are
237: altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,
238: and hear the lady sing in Welsh.
239: HOTSPUR: I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.
240: LADY PERCY: Wouldst thou have thy head broken?
241: HOTSPUR: No.
242: LADY PERCY: Then be still.
243: HOTSPUR: Neither;'tis a woman's fault.
244: LADY PERCY: Now God help thee!
245: HOTSPUR: To the Welsh lady's bed.
246: LADY PERCY: What's that?
247: HOTSPUR: Peace! she sings.
248: Come, Kate, I'll have your song too.
249: LADY PERCY: Not mine, in good sooth.
250: HOTSPUR: Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a
251: comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and
252: 'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and
253: 'as sure as day,'
254: And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,
255: As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.
256: Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,
257: A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'
258: And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,
259: To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.
260: Come, sing.
261: LADY PERCY: I will not sing.
262: HOTSPUR: 'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast
263: teacher. An the indentures be drawn, I'll away
264: within these two hours; and so, come in when ye will.
265: GLENDOWER: Come, come, Lord Mortimer; you are as slow
266: As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.
267: By this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,
268: And then to horse immediately.
269: MORTIMER: With all my heart.
ACT 3 SCENE 2

1: KING HENRY IV: Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I
2: Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,
3: For we shall presently have need of you.
4: I know not whether God will have it so,
5: For some displeasing service I have done,
6: That, in his secret doom, out of my blood
7: He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;
8: But thou dost in thy passages of life
9: Make me believe that thou art only mark'd
10: For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
11: To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,
12: Could such inordinate and low desires,
13: Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,
14: Such barren pleasures, rude society,
15: As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,
16: Accompany the greatness of thy blood
17: And hold their level with thy princely heart?
18: PRINCE HENRY: So please your majesty, I would I could
19: Quit all offences with as clear excuse
20: As well as I am doubtless I can purge
21: Myself of many I am charged withal:
22: Yet such extenuation let me beg,
23: As, in reproof of many tales devised,
24: which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,
25: By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,
26: I may, for some things true, wherein my youth
27: Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,
28: Find pardon on my true submission.
29: KING HENRY IV: God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,
30: At thy affections, which do hold a wing
31: Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
32: Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.
33: Which by thy younger brother is supplied,
34: And art almost an alien to the hearts
35: Of all the court and princes of my blood:
36: The hope and expectation of thy time
37: Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man
38: Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.
39: Had I so lavish of my presence been,
40: So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,
41: So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
42: Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
43: Had still kept loyal to possession
44: And left me in reputeless banishment,
45: A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
46: By being seldom seen, I could not stir
47: But like a comet I was wonder'd at;
48: That men would tell their children 'This is he;'
49: Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'
50: And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
51: And dress'd myself in such humility
52: That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
53: Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
54: Even in the presence of the crowned king.
55: Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;
56: My presence, like a robe pontifical,
57: Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,
58: Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast
59: And won by rareness such solemnity.
60: The skipping king, he ambled up and down
61: With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
62: Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,
63: Mingled his royalty with capering fools,
64: Had his great name profaned with their scorns
65: And gave his countenance, against his name,
66: To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
67: Of every beardless vain comparative,
68: Grew a companion to the common streets,
69: Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
70: That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,
71: They surfeited with honey and began
72: To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
73: More than a little is by much too much.
74: So when he had occasion to be seen,
75: He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
76: Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes
77: As, sick and blunted with community,
78: Afford no extraordinary gaze,
79: Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
80: When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;
81: But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,
82: Slept in his face and render'd such aspect
83: As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
84: Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.
85: And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;
86: For thou has lost thy princely privilege
87: With vile participation: not an eye
88: But is a-weary of thy common sight,
89: Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;
90: Which now doth that I would not have it do,
91: Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.
92: PRINCE HENRY: I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,
93: Be more myself.
94: KING HENRY IV: For all the world
95: As thou art to this hour was Richard then
96: When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,
97: And even as I was then is Percy now.
98: Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,
99: He hath more worthy interest to the state
100: Than thou the shadow of succession;
101: For of no right, nor colour like to right,
102: He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
103: Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,
104: And, being no more in debt to years than thou,
105: Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
106: To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
107: What never-dying honour hath he got
108: Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,
109: Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
110: Holds from all soldiers chief majority
111: And military title capital
112: Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:
113: Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
114: This infant warrior, in his enterprises
115: Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,
116: Enlarged him and made a friend of him,
117: To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
118: And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
119: And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
120: The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,
121: Capitulate against us and are up.
122: But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
123: Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,
124: Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?
125: Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,
126: Base inclination and the start of spleen
127: To fight against me under Percy's pay,
128: To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,
129: To show how much thou art degenerate.
130: PRINCE HENRY: Do not think so; you shall not find it so:
131: And God forgive them that so much have sway'd
132: Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!
133: I will redeem all this on Percy's head
134: And in the closing of some glorious day
135: Be bold to tell you that I am your son;
136: When I will wear a garment all of blood
137: And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
138: Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:
139: And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,
140: That this same child of honour and renown,
141: This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,
142: And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
143: For every honour sitting on his helm,
144: Would they were multitudes, and on my head
145: My shames redoubled! for the time will come,
146: That I shall make this northern youth exchange
147: His glorious deeds for my indignities.
148: Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
149: To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;
150: And I will call him to so strict account,
151: That he shall render every glory up,
152: Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,
153: Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
154: This, in the name of God, I promise here:
155: The which if He be pleased I shall perform,
156: I do beseech your majesty may salve
157: The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:
158: If not, the end of life cancels all bands;
159: And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
160: Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
161: KING HENRY IV: A hundred thousand rebels die in this:
162: Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.
163: How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed.
164: SIR WALTER BLUNT: So hath the business that I come to speak of.
165: Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
166: That Douglas and the English rebels met
167: The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury
168: A mighty and a fearful head they are,
169: If promises be kept on every hand,
170: As ever offer'd foul play in the state.
171: KING HENRY IV: The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day;
172: With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;
173: For this advertisement is five days old:
174: On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward;
175: On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting
176: Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march
177: Through Gloucestershire; by which account,
178: Our business valued, some twelve days hence
179: Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.
180: Our hands are full of business: let's away;
181: Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay.
182: Scene III: Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.
183: FALSTAFF: Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last
184: action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my
185: skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose
186: gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,
187: I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some
188: liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I
189: shall have no strength to repent. An I have not
190: forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I
191: am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a
192: church! Company, villanous company, hath been the
193: spoil of me.
194: BARDOLPH: Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.
195: FALSTAFF: Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make
196: me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman
197: need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not
198: above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once
199: in a quarter--of an hour; paid money that I
200: borrowed, three of four times; lived well and in
201: good compass: and now I live out of all order, out
202: of all compass.
203: BARDOLPH: Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs
204: be out of all compass, out of all reasonable
205: compass, Sir John.
206: FALSTAFF: Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:
207: thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in
208: the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the
209: Knight of the Burning Lamp.
210: BARDOLPH: Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.
211: FALSTAFF: No, I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many
212: a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I
213: never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and
214: Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his
215: robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way
216: given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath
217: should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but
218: thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but
219: for the light in thy face, the son of utter
220: darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the
221: night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou
222: hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,
223: there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a
224: perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!
225: Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and
226: torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt
227: tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast
228: drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
229: at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have
230: maintained that salamander of yours with fire any
231: time this two and thirty years; God reward me for
232: it!
233: BARDOLPH: 'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!
234: FALSTAFF: God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burned.
235: How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired
236: yet who picked my pocket?
237: Hostess: Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you
238: think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,
239: I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy
240: by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair
241: was never lost in my house before.
242: FALSTAFF: Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many
243: a hair; and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go
244: to, you are a woman, go.
245: Hostess: Who, I? no; I defy thee: God's light, I was never
246: called so in mine own house before.
247: FALSTAFF: Go to, I know you well enough.
248: Hostess: No, Sir John; You do not know me, Sir John. I know
249: you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and now
250: you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought
251: you a dozen of shirts to your back.
252: FALSTAFF: Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to
253: bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them.
254: Hostess: Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight
255: shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir
256: John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent
257: you, four and twenty pound.
258: FALSTAFF: He had his part of it; let him pay.
259: Hostess: He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.
260: FALSTAFF: How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich?
261: let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:
262: Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker
263: of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I
264: shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a
265: seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.
266: Hostess: O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know not
267: how oft, that ring was copper!
268: FALSTAFF: How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood, an
269: he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he
270: would say so.
271: How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i' faith?
272: must we all march?
273: BARDOLPH: Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.
274: Hostess: My lord, I pray you, hear me.
275: PRINCE HENRY: What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy
276: husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.
277: Hostess: Good my lord, hear me.
278: FALSTAFF: Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.
279: PRINCE HENRY: What sayest thou, Jack?
280: FALSTAFF: The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras
281: and had my pocket picked: this house is turned
282: bawdy-house; they pick pockets.
283: PRINCE HENRY: What didst thou lose, Jack?
284: FALSTAFF: Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of
285: forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my
286: grandfather's.
287: PRINCE HENRY: A trifle, some eight-penny matter.
288: Hostess: So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your
289: grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely
290: of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said
291: he would cudgel you.
292: PRINCE HENRY: What! he did not?
293: Hostess: There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.
294: FALSTAFF: There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
295: prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn
296: fox; and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the
297: deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,
298: go
299: Hostess: Say, what thing? what thing?
300: FALSTAFF: What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.
301: Hostess: I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou
302: shouldst know it; I am an honest man's wife: and,
303: setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to
304: call me so.
305: FALSTAFF: Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say
306: otherwise.
307: Hostess: Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?
308: FALSTAFF: What beast! why, an otter.
309: PRINCE HENRY: An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?
310: FALSTAFF: Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not
311: where to have her.
312: Hostess: Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any
313: man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!
314: PRINCE HENRY: Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.
315: Hostess: So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you
316: ought him a thousand pound.
317: PRINCE HENRY: Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?
318: FALSTAFF: A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth
319: a million: thou owest me thy love.
320: Hostess: Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would
321: cudgel you.
322: FALSTAFF: Did I, Bardolph?
323: BARDOLPH: Indeed, Sir John, you said so.
324: FALSTAFF: Yea, if he said my ring was copper.
325: PRINCE HENRY: I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?
326: FALSTAFF: Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:
327: but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the
328: roaring of a lion's whelp.
329: PRINCE HENRY: And why not as the lion?
330: FALSTAFF: The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou
331: think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an
332: I do, I pray God my girdle break.
333: PRINCE HENRY: O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy
334: knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,
335: truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all
336: filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest
337: woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,
338: impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in
339: thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of
340: bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of
341: sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket
342: were enriched with any other injuries but these, I
343: am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will
344: not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?
345: FALSTAFF: Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of
346: innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack
347: Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I
348: have more flesh than another man, and therefore more
349: frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?
350: PRINCE HENRY: It appears so by the story.
351: FALSTAFF: Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast;
352: love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy
353: guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest
354: reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,
355: prithee, be gone.
356: Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,
357: lad, how is that answered?
358: PRINCE HENRY: O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to
359: thee: the money is paid back again.
360: FALSTAFF: O, I do not like that paying back; 'tis a double labour.
361: PRINCE HENRY: I am good friends with my father and may do any thing.
362: FALSTAFF: Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and
363: do it with unwashed hands too.
364: BARDOLPH: Do, my lord.
365: PRINCE HENRY: I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.
366: FALSTAFF: I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find
367: one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the
368: age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am
369: heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for
370: these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I
371: laud them, I praise them.
372: PRINCE HENRY: Bardolph!
373: BARDOLPH: My lord?
374: PRINCE HENRY: Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, to my
375: brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.
376: Go, Peto, to horse, to horse; for thou and I have
377: thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.
378: Jack, meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two
379: o'clock in the afternoon.
380: There shalt thou know thy charge; and there receive
381: Money and order for their furniture.
382: The land is burning; Percy stands on high;
383: And either we or they must lower lie.
ACT 4 SCENE 1

1: HOTSPUR: Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth
2: In this fine age were not thought flattery,
3: Such attribution should the Douglas have,
4: As not a soldier of this season's stamp
5: Should go so general current through the world.
6: By God, I cannot flatter; I do defy
7: The tongues of soothers; but a braver place
8: In my heart's love hath no man than yourself:
9: Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.
10: EARL OF DOUGLAS: Thou art the king of honour:
11: No man so potent breathes upon the ground
12: But I will beard him.
13: HOTSPUR: Do so, and 'tis well.
14: What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you.
15: Messenger: These letters come from your father.
16: HOTSPUR: Letters from him! why comes he not himself?
17: Messenger: He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.
18: HOTSPUR: 'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick
19: In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?
20: Under whose government come they along?
21: Messenger: His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.
22: EARL OF WORCESTER: I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?
23: Messenger: He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;
24: And at the time of my departure thence
25: He was much fear'd by his physicians.
26: EARL OF WORCESTER: I would the state of time had first been whole
27: Ere he by sickness had been visited:
28: His health was never better worth than now.
29: HOTSPUR: Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
30: The very life-blood of our enterprise;
31: 'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.
32: He writes me here, that inward sickness--
33: And that his friends by deputation could not
34: So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet
35: To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
36: On any soul removed but on his own.
37: Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,
38: That with our small conjunction we should on,
39: To see how fortune is disposed to us;
40: For, as he writes, there is no quailing now.
41: Because the king is certainly possess'd
42: Of all our purposes. What say you to it?
43: EARL OF WORCESTER: Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
44: HOTSPUR: A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:
45: And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want
46: Seems more than we shall find it: were it good
47: To set the exact wealth of all our states
48: All at one cast? to set so rich a main
49: On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?
50: It were not good; for therein should we read
51: The very bottom and the soul of hope,
52: The very list, the very utmost bound
53: Of all our fortunes.
54: EARL OF DOUGLAS: 'Faith, and so we should;
55: Where now remains a sweet reversion:
56: We may boldly spend upon the hope of what
57: Is to come in:
58: A comfort of retirement lives in this.
59: HOTSPUR: A rendezvous, a home to fly unto.
60: If that the devil and mischance look big
61: Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.
62: EARL OF WORCESTER: But yet I would your father had been here.
63: The quality and hair of our attempt
64: Brooks no division: it will be thought
65: By some, that know not why he is away,
66: That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike
67: Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:
68: And think how such an apprehension
69: May turn the tide of fearful faction
70: And breed a kind of question in our cause;
71: For well you know we of the offering side
72: Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,
73: And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence
74: The eye of reason may pry in upon us:
75: This absence of your father's draws a curtain,
76: That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
77: Before not dreamt of.
78: HOTSPUR: You strain too far.
79: I rather of his absence make this use:
80: It lends a lustre and more great opinion,
81: A larger dare to our great enterprise,
82: Than if the earl were here; for men must think,
83: If we without his help can make a head
84: To push against a kingdom, with his help
85: We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.
86: Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.
87: EARL OF DOUGLAS: As heart can think: there is not such a word
88: Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.
89: HOTSPUR: My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul.
90: VERNON: Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.
91: The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,
92: Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.
93: HOTSPUR: No harm: what more?
94: VERNON: And further, I have learn'd,
95: The king himself in person is set forth,
96: Or hitherwards intended speedily,
97: With strong and mighty preparation.
98: HOTSPUR: He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,
99: The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,
100: And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,
101: And bid it pass?
102: VERNON: All furnish'd, all in arms;
103: All plumed like estridges that with the wind
104: Baited like eagles having lately bathed;
105: Glittering in golden coats, like images;
106: As full of spirit as the month of May,
107: And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;
108: Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.
109: I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,
110: His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd
111: Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,
112: And vaulted with such ease into his seat,
113: As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,
114: To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
115: And witch the world with noble horsemanship.
116: HOTSPUR: No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,
117: This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:
118: They come like sacrifices in their trim,
119: And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war
120: All hot and bleeding will we offer them:
121: The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit
122: Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire
123: To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
124: And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,
125: Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
126: Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:
127: Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,
128: Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.
129: O that Glendower were come!
130: VERNON: There is more news:
131: I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,
132: He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.
133: EARL OF DOUGLAS: That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.
134: WORCESTER: Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.
135: HOTSPUR: What may the king's whole battle reach unto?
136: VERNON: To thirty thousand.
137: HOTSPUR: Forty let it be:
138: My father and Glendower being both away,
139: The powers of us may serve so great a day
140: Come, let us take a muster speedily:
141: Doomsday is near; die all, die merrily.
142: EARL OF DOUGLAS: Talk not of dying: I am out of fear
143: Of death or death's hand for this one-half year.
ACT 4 SCENE 2

1: FALSTAFF: Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry; fill me a
2: bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through;
3: we'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight.
4: BARDOLPH: Will you give me money, captain?
5: FALSTAFF: Lay out, lay out.
6: BARDOLPH: This bottle makes an angel.
7: FALSTAFF: An if it do, take it for thy labour; and if it make
8: twenty, take them all; I'll answer the coinage. Bid
9: my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end.
10: BARDOLPH: I will, captain: farewell.
11: FALSTAFF: If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused
12: gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.
13: I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty
14: soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me
15: none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire
16: me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked
17: twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,
18: as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as
19: fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
20: fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such
21: toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no
22: bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out
23: their services; and now my whole charge consists of
24: ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of
25: companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the
26: painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his
27: sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but
28: discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to
29: younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers
30: trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a
31: long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than
32: an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up
33: the rooms of them that have bought out their
34: services, that you would think that I had a hundred
35: and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
36: swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad
37: fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded
38: all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye
39: hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through
40: Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the
41: villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had
42: gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of
43: prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my
44: company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked
45: together and thrown over the shoulders like an
46: herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say
47: the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or
48: the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all
49: one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge.
50: PRINCE HENRY: How now, blown Jack! how now, quilt!
51: FALSTAFF: What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou
52: in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I
53: cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been
54: at Shrewsbury.
55: WESTMORELAND: Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were
56: there, and you too; but my powers are there already.
57: The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must
58: away all night.
59: FALSTAFF: Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to
60: steal cream.
61: PRINCE HENRY: I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath
62: already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose
63: fellows are these that come after?
64: FALSTAFF: Mine, Hal, mine.
65: PRINCE HENRY: I did never see such pitiful rascals.
66: FALSTAFF: Tut, tut; good enough to toss; food for powder, food
67: for powder; they'll fill a pit as well as better:
68: tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.
69: WESTMORELAND: Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor
70: and bare, too beggarly.
71: FALSTAFF: 'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had
72: that; and for their bareness, I am sure they never
73: learned that of me.
74: PRINCE HENRY: No I'll be sworn; unless you call three fingers on
75: the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is
76: already in the field.
77: FALSTAFF: What, is the king encamped?
78: WESTMORELAND: He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long.
79: FALSTAFF: Well,
80: To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast
81: Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.
ACT 4 SCENE 3

1: HOTSPUR: We'll fight with him to-night.
2: EARL OF WORCESTER: It may not be.
3: EARL OF DOUGLAS: You give him then the advantage.
4: VERNON: Not a whit.
5: HOTSPUR: Why say you so? looks he not for supply?
6: VERNON: So do we.
7: HOTSPUR: His is certain, ours is doubtful.
8: EARL OF WORCESTER: Good cousin, be advised; stir not tonight.
9: VERNON: Do not, my lord.
10: EARL OF DOUGLAS: You do not counsel well:
11: You speak it out of fear and cold heart.
12: VERNON: Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life,
13: And I dare well maintain it with my life,
14: If well-respected honour bid me on,
15: I hold as little counsel with weak fear
16: As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives:
17: Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle
18: Which of us fears.
19: EARL OF DOUGLAS: Yea, or to-night.
20: VERNON: Content.
21: HOTSPUR: To-night, say I.
22: VERNON: Come, come it nay not be. I wonder much,
23: Being men of such great leading as you are,
24: That you foresee not what impediments
25: Drag back our expedition: certain horse
26: Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up:
27: Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today;
28: And now their pride and mettle is asleep,
29: Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,
30: That not a horse is half the half of himself.
31: HOTSPUR: So are the horses of the enemy
32: In general, journey-bated and brought low:
33: The better part of ours are full of rest.
34: EARL OF WORCESTER: The number of the king exceedeth ours:
35: For God's sake. cousin, stay till all come in.
36: SIR WALTER BLUNT: I come with gracious offers from the king,
37: if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.
38: HOTSPUR: Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God
39: You were of our determination!
40: Some of us love you well; and even those some
41: Envy your great deservings and good name,
42: Because you are not of our quality,
43: But stand against us like an enemy.
44: SIR WALTER BLUNT: And God defend but still I should stand so,
45: So long as out of limit and true rule
46: You stand against anointed majesty.
47: But to my charge. The king hath sent to know
48: The nature of your griefs, and whereupon
49: You conjure from the breast of civil peace
50: Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land
51: Audacious cruelty. If that the king
52: Have any way your good deserts forgot,
53: Which he confesseth to be manifold,
54: He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed
55: You shall have your desires with interest
56: And pardon absolute for yourself and these
57: Herein misled by your suggestion.
58: HOTSPUR: The king is kind; and well we know the king
59: Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
60: My father and my uncle and myself
61: Did give him that same royalty he wears;
62: And when he was not six and twenty strong,
63: Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,
64: A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
65: My father gave him welcome to the shore;
66: And when he heard him swear and vow to God
67: He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,
68: To sue his livery and beg his peace,
69: With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,
70: My father, in kind heart and pity moved,
71: Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.
72: Now when the lords and barons of the realm
73: Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,
74: The more and less came in with cap and knee;
75: Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,
76: Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,
77: Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,
78: Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him
79: Even at the heels in golden multitudes.
80: He presently, as greatness knows itself,
81: Steps me a little higher than his vow
82: Made to my father, while his blood was poor,
83: Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;
84: And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
85: Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
86: That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,
87: Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep
88: Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,
89: This seeming brow of justice, did he win
90: The hearts of all that he did angle for;
91: Proceeded further; cut me off the heads
92: Of all the favourites that the absent king
93: In deputation left behind him here,
94: When he was personal in the Irish war.
95: SIR WALTER BLUNT: Tut, I came not to hear this.
96: HOTSPUR: Then to the point.
97: In short time after, he deposed the king;
98: Soon after that, deprived him of his life;
99: And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:
100: To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,
101: Who is, if every owner were well placed,
102: Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,
103: There without ransom to lie forfeited;
104: Disgraced me in my happy victories,
105: Sought to entrap me by intelligence;
106: Rated mine uncle from the council-board;
107: In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;
108: Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,
109: And in conclusion drove us to seek out
110: This head of safety; and withal to pry
111: Into his title, the which we find
112: Too indirect for long continuance.
113: SIR WALTER BLUNT: Shall I return this answer to the king?
114: HOTSPUR: Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.
115: Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd
116: Some surety for a safe return again,
117: And in the morning early shall my uncle
118: Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.
119: SIR WALTER BLUNT: I would you would accept of grace and love.
120: HOTSPUR: And may be so we shall.
121: SIR WALTER BLUNT: Pray God you do.
ACT 4 SCENE 4

1: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: Hie, good Sir Michael; bear this sealed brief
2: With winged haste to the lord marshal;
3: This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest
4: To whom they are directed. If you knew
5: How much they do to import, you would make haste.
6: SIR MICHAEL: My good lord,
7: I guess their tenor.
8: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: Like enough you do.
9: To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day
10: Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
11: Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,
12: As I am truly given to understand,
13: The king with mighty and quick-raised power
14: Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,
15: What with the sickness of Northumberland,
16: Whose power was in the first proportion,
17: And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,
18: Who with them was a rated sinew too
19: And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,
20: I fear the power of Percy is too weak
21: To wage an instant trial with the king.
22: SIR MICHAEL: Why, my good lord, you need not fear;
23: There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.
24: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: No, Mortimer is not there.
25: SIR MICHAEL: But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,
26: And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head
27: Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.
28: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn
29: The special head of all the land together:
30: The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,
31: The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;
32: And moe corrivals and dear men
33: Of estimation and command in arms.
34: SIR MICHAEL: Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.
ACT 5 SCENE 1

1: KING HENRY IV: How bloodily the sun begins to peer
2: Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale
3: At his distemperature.
4: PRINCE HENRY: The southern wind
5: Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,
6: And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
7: Foretells a tempest and a blustering day.
8: KING HENRY IV: Then with the losers let it sympathize,
9: For nothing can seem foul to those that win.
10: How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well
11: That you and I should meet upon such terms
12: As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,
13: And made us doff our easy robes of peace,
14: To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:
15: This is not well, my lord, this is not well.
16: What say you to it? will you again unknit
17: This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?
18: And move in that obedient orb again
19: Where you did give a fair and natural light,
20: And be no more an exhaled meteor,
21: A prodigy of fear and a portent
22: Of broached mischief to the unborn times?
23: EARL OF WORCESTER: Hear me, my liege:
24: For mine own part, I could be well content
25: To entertain the lag-end of my life
26: With quiet hours; for I do protest,
27: I have not sought the day of this dislike.
28: KING HENRY IV: You have not sought it! how comes it, then?
29: FALSTAFF: Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.
30: PRINCE HENRY: Peace, chewet, peace!
31: EARL OF WORCESTER: It pleased your majesty to turn your looks
32: Of favour from myself and all our house;
33: And yet I must remember you, my lord,
34: We were the first and dearest of your friends.
35: For you my staff of office did I break
36: In Richard's time; and posted day and night
37: to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,
38: When yet you were in place and in account
39: Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
40: It was myself, my brother and his son,
41: That brought you home and boldly did outdare
42: The dangers of the time. You swore to us,
43: And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,
44: That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;
45: Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,
46: The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:
47: To this we swore our aid. But in short space
48: It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;
49: And such a flood of greatness fell on you,
50: What with our help, what with the absent king,
51: What with the injuries of a wanton time,
52: The seeming sufferances that you had borne,
53: And the contrarious winds that held the king
54: So long in his unlucky Irish wars
55: That all in England did repute him dead:
56: And from this swarm of fair advantages
57: You took occasion to be quickly woo'd
58: To gripe the general sway into your hand;
59: Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;
60: And being fed by us you used us so
61: As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,
62: Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;
63: Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
64: That even our love durst not come near your sight
65: For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing
66: We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly
67: Out of sight and raise this present head;
68: Whereby we stand opposed by such means
69: As you yourself have forged against yourself
70: By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,
71: And violation of all faith and troth
72: Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.
73: KING HENRY IV: These things indeed you have articulate,
74: Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,
75: To face the garment of rebellion
76: With some fine colour that may please the eye
77: Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,
78: Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
79: Of hurlyburly innovation:
80: And never yet did insurrection want
81: Such water-colours to impaint his cause;
82: Nor moody beggars, starving for a time
83: Of pellmell havoc and confusion.
84: PRINCE HENRY: In both your armies there is many a soul
85: Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,
86: If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,
87: The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
88: In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,
89: This present enterprise set off his head,
90: I do not think a braver gentleman,
91: More active-valiant or more valiant-young,
92: More daring or more bold, is now alive
93: To grace this latter age with noble deeds.
94: For my part, I may speak it to my shame,
95: I have a truant been to chivalry;
96: And so I hear he doth account me too;
97: Yet this before my father's majesty--
98: I am content that he shall take the odds
99: Of his great name and estimation,
100: And will, to save the blood on either side,
101: Try fortune with him in a single fight.
102: KING HENRY IV: And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,
103: Albeit considerations infinite
104: Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,
105: We love our people well; even those we love
106: That are misled upon your cousin's part;
107: And, will they take the offer of our grace,
108: Both he and they and you, every man
109: Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:
110: So tell your cousin, and bring me word
111: What he will do: but if he will not yield,
112: Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
113: And they shall do their office. So, be gone;
114: We will not now be troubled with reply:
115: We offer fair; take it advisedly.
116: PRINCE HENRY: It will not be accepted, on my life:
117: The Douglas and the Hotspur both together
118: Are confident against the world in arms.
119: KING HENRY IV: Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge;
120: For, on their answer, will we set on them:
121: And God befriend us, as our cause is just!
122: FALSTAFF: Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride
123: me, so; 'tis a point of friendship.
124: PRINCE HENRY: Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.
125: Say thy prayers, and farewell.
126: FALSTAFF: I would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well.
127: PRINCE HENRY: Why, thou owest God a death.
128: FALSTAFF: 'Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before
129: his day. What need I be so forward with him that
130: calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honour pricks
131: me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I
132: come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or
133: an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.
134: Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is
135: honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what
136: is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?
137: he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.
138: Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,
139: to the dead. But will it not live with the living?
140: no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore
141: I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so
142: ends my catechism.
ACT 5 SCENE 2

1: EARL OF WORCESTER: O, no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,
2: The liberal and kind offer of the king.
3: VERNON: 'Twere best he did.
4: EARL OF WORCESTER: Then are we all undone.
5: It is not possible, it cannot be,
6: The king should keep his word in loving us;
7: He will suspect us still and find a time
8: To punish this offence in other faults:
9: Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;
10: For treason is but trusted like the fox,
11: Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,
12: Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.
13: Look how we can, or sad or merrily,
14: Interpretation will misquote our looks,
15: And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
16: The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.
17: My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;
18: it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,
19: And an adopted name of privilege,
20: A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen:
21: All his offences live upon my head
22: And on his father's; we did train him on,
23: And, his corruption being ta'en from us,
24: We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.
25: Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,
26: In any case, the offer of the king.
27: VERNON: Deliver what you will; I'll say 'tis so.
28: Here comes your cousin.
29: HOTSPUR: My uncle is return'd:
30: Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.
31: Uncle, what news?
32: EARL OF WORCESTER: The king will bid you battle presently.
33: EARL OF DOUGLAS: Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.
34: HOTSPUR: Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.
35: EARL OF DOUGLAS: Marry, and shall, and very willingly.
36: EARL OF WORCESTER: There is no seeming mercy in the king.
37: HOTSPUR: Did you beg any? God forbid!
38: EARL OF WORCESTER: I told him gently of our grievances,
39: Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,
40: By now forswearing that he is forsworn:
41: He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
42: With haughty arms this hateful name in us.
43: EARL OF DOUGLAS: Arm, gentlemen; to arms! for I have thrown
44: A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
45: And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it;
46: Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.
47: EARL OF WORCESTER: The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king,
48: And, nephew, challenged you to single fight.
49: HOTSPUR: O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,
50: And that no man might draw short breath today
51: But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,
52: How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?
53: VERNON: No, by my soul; I never in my life
54: Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,
55: Unless a brother should a brother dare
56: To gentle exercise and proof of arms.
57: He gave you all the duties of a man;
58: Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue,
59: Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle,
60: Making you ever better than his praise
61: By still dispraising praise valued in you;
62: And, which became him like a prince indeed,
63: He made a blushing cital of himself;
64: And chid his truant youth with such a grace
65: As if he master'd there a double spirit.
66: Of teaching and of learning instantly.
67: There did he pause: but let me tell the world,
68: If he outlive the envy of this day,
69: England did never owe so sweet a hope,
70: So much misconstrued in his wantonness.
71: HOTSPUR: Cousin, I think thou art enamoured
72: On his follies: never did I hear
73: Of any prince so wild a libertine.
74: But be he as he will, yet once ere night
75: I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,
76: That he shall shrink under my courtesy.
77: Arm, arm with speed: and, fellows, soldiers, friends,
78: Better consider what you have to do
79: Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,
80: Can lift your blood up with persuasion.
81: Messenger: My lord, here are letters for you.
82: HOTSPUR: I cannot read them now.
83: O gentlemen, the time of life is short!
84: To spend that shortness basely were too long,
85: If life did ride upon a dial's point,
86: Still ending at the arrival of an hour.
87: An if we live, we live to tread on kings;
88: If die, brave death, when princes die with us!
89: Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair,
90: When the intent of bearing them is just.
91: Messenger: My lord, prepare; the king comes on apace.
92: HOTSPUR: I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,
93: For I profess not talking; only this--
94: Let each man do his best: and here draw I
95: A sword, whose temper I intend to stain
96: With the best blood that I can meet withal
97: In the adventure of this perilous day.
98: Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on.
99: Sound all the lofty instruments of war,
100: And by that music let us all embrace;
101: For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall
102: A second time do such a courtesy.
ACT 5 SCENE 3

1: SIR WALTER BLUNT: What is thy name, that in the battle thus
2: Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek
3: Upon my head?
4: EARL OF DOUGLAS: Know then, my name is Douglas;
5: And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
6: Because some tell me that thou art a king.
7: SIR WALTER BLUNT: They tell thee true.
8: EARL OF DOUGLAS: The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought
9: Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,
10: This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,
11: Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.
12: SIR WALTER BLUNT: I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;
13: And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
14: Lord Stafford's death.
15: HOTSPUR: O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,
16: never had triumph'd upon a Scot.
17: EARL OF DOUGLAS: All's done, all's won; here breathless lies the king.
18: HOTSPUR: Where?
19: EARL OF DOUGLAS: Here.
20: HOTSPUR: This, Douglas? no: I know this face full well:
21: A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
22: Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.
23: EARL OF DOUGLAS: A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!
24: A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear:
25: Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?
26: HOTSPUR: The king hath many marching in his coats.
27: EARL OF DOUGLAS: Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
28: I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,
29: Until I meet the king.
30: HOTSPUR: Up, and away!
31: Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.
32: FALSTAFF: Though I could 'scape shot-free at London, I fear
33: the shot here; here's no scoring but upon the pate.
34: Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour
35: for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten
36: lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I
37: need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have
38: led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's
39: not three of my hundred and fifty left alive; and
40: they are for the town's end, to beg during life.
41: But who comes here?
42: PRINCE HENRY: What, stand'st thou idle here? lend me thy sword:
43: Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff
44: Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,
45: Whose deaths are yet unrevenged: I prithee,
46: lend me thy sword.
47: FALSTAFF: O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile.
48: Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have
49: done this day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure.
50: PRINCE HENRY: He is, indeed; and living to kill thee. I prithee,
51: lend me thy sword.
52: FALSTAFF: Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'st
53: not my sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt.
54: PRINCE HENRY: Give it to me: what, is it in the case?
55: FALSTAFF: Ay, Hal; 'tis hot, 'tis hot; there's that will sack a city.
56: PRINCE HENRY: What, is it a time to jest and dally now?
57: FALSTAFF: Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do
58: come in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in his
59: willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like
60: not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath: give me
61: life: which if I can save, so; if not, honour comes
62: unlooked for, and there's an end.
ACT 5 SCENE 4

1: KING HENRY IV: I prithee,
2: Harry, withdraw thyself; thou bleed'st too much.
3: Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.
4: LANCASTER: Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.
5: PRINCE HENRY: I beseech your majesty, make up,
6: Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.
7: KING HENRY IV: I will do so.
8: My Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent.
9: WESTMORELAND: Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent.
10: PRINCE HENRY: Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help:
11: And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
12: The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,
13: Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,
14: and rebels' arms triumph in massacres!
15: LANCASTER: We breathe too long: come, cousin Westmoreland,
16: Our duty this way lies; for God's sake come.
17: PRINCE HENRY: By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster;
18: I did not think thee lord of such a spirit:
19: Before, I loved thee as a brother, John;
20: But now, I do respect thee as my soul.
21: KING HENRY IV: I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
22: With lustier maintenance than I did look for
23: Of such an ungrown warrior.
24: PRINCE HENRY: O, this boy
25: Lends mettle to us all!
26: EARL OF DOUGLAS: Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:
27: I am the Douglas, fatal to all those
28: That wear those colours on them: what art thou,
29: That counterfeit'st the person of a king?
30: KING HENRY IV: The king himself; who, Douglas, grieves at heart
31: So many of his shadows thou hast met
32: And not the very king. I have two boys
33: Seek Percy and thyself about the field:
34: But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,
35: I will assay thee: so, defend thyself.
36: EARL OF DOUGLAS: I fear thou art another counterfeit;
37: And yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king:
38: But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,
39: And thus I win thee.
40: PRINCE HENRY: Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
41: Never to hold it up again! the spirits
42: Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms:
43: It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee;
44: Who never promiseth but he means to pay.
45: Cheerly, my lord how fares your grace?
46: Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,
47: And so hath Clifton: I'll to Clifton straight.
48: KING HENRY IV: Stay, and breathe awhile:
49: Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,
50: And show'd thou makest some tender of my life,
51: In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.
52: PRINCE HENRY: O God! they did me too much injury
53: That ever said I hearken'd for your death.
54: If it were so, I might have let alone
55: The insulting hand of Douglas over you,
56: Which would have been as speedy in your end
57: As all the poisonous potions in the world
58: And saved the treacherous labour of your son.
59: KING HENRY IV: Make up to Clifton: I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.
60: HOTSPUR: If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.
61: PRINCE HENRY: Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.
62: HOTSPUR: My name is Harry Percy.
63: PRINCE HENRY: Why, then I see
64: A very valiant rebel of the name.
65: I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,
66: To share with me in glory any more:
67: Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;
68: Nor can one England brook a double reign,
69: Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.
70: HOTSPUR: Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come
71: To end the one of us; and would to God
72: Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!
73: PRINCE HENRY: I'll make it greater ere I part from thee;
74: And all the budding honours on thy crest
75: I'll crop, to make a garland for my head.
76: HOTSPUR: I can no longer brook thy vanities.
77: FALSTAFF: Well said, Hal! to it Hal! Nay, you shall find no
78: boy's play here, I can tell you.
79: HOTSPUR: O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!
80: I better brook the loss of brittle life
81: Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;
82: They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:
83: But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;
84: And time, that takes survey of all the world,
85: Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,
86: But that the earthy and cold hand of death
87: Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust
88: And food for--
89: PRINCE HENRY: For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart!
90: Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!
91: When that this body did contain a spirit,
92: A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
93: But now two paces of the vilest earth
94: Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead
95: Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.
96: If thou wert sensible of courtesy,
97: I should not make so dear a show of zeal:
98: But let my favours hide thy mangled face;
99: And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself
100: For doing these fair rites of tenderness.
101: Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!
102: Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,
103: But not remember'd in thy epitaph!
104: What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh
105: Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
106: I could have better spared a better man:
107: O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,
108: If I were much in love with vanity!
109: Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,
110: Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.
111: Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
112: Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.
113: FALSTAFF: [Rising up] Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,
114: I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too
115: to-morrow. 'Sblood,'twas time to counterfeit, or
116: that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.
117: Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,
118: is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the
119: counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:
120: but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby
121: liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and
122: perfect image of life indeed. The better part of
123: valour is discretion; in the which better part I
124: have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this
125: gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he
126: should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am
127: afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.
128: Therefore I'll make him sure; yea, and I'll swear I
129: killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?
130: Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.
131: Therefore, sirrah,
132: with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me.
133: PRINCE HENRY: Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd
134: Thy maiden sword.
135: LANCASTER: But, soft! whom have we here?
136: Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?
137: PRINCE HENRY: I did; I saw him dead,
138: Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art
139: thou alive?
140: Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?
141: I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes
142: Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.
143: FALSTAFF: No, that's certain; I am not a double man: but if I
144: be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:
145: if your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let
146: him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either
147: earl or duke, I can assure you.
148: PRINCE HENRY: Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.
149: FALSTAFF: Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to
150: lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;
151: and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and
152: fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be
153: believed, so; if not, let them that should reward
154: valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take
155: it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the
156: thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,
157: 'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.
158: LANCASTER: This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.
159: PRINCE HENRY: This is the strangest fellow, brother John.
160: Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:
161: For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,
162: I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.
163: The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.
164: Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,
165: To see what friends are living, who are dead.
166: FALSTAFF: I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that
167: rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,
168: I'll grow less; for I'll purge, and leave sack, and
169: live cleanly as a nobleman should do.
ACT 5 SCENE 5

1: KING HENRY IV: Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
2: Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,
3: Pardon and terms of love to all of you?
4: And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?
5: Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?
6: Three knights upon our party slain to-day,
7: A noble earl and many a creature else
8: Had been alive this hour,
9: If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne
10: Betwixt our armies true intelligence.
11: EARL OF WORCESTER: What I have done my safety urged me to;
12: And I embrace this fortune patiently,
13: Since not to be avoided it falls on me.
14: KING HENRY IV: Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too:
15: Other offenders we will pause upon.
16: How goes the field?
17: PRINCE HENRY: The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw
18: The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,
19: The noble Percy slain, and all his men
20: Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;
21: And falling from a hill, he was so bruised
22: That the pursuers took him. At my tent
23: The Douglas is; and I beseech your grace
24: I may dispose of him.
25: KING HENRY IV: With all my heart.
26: PRINCE HENRY: Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you
27: This honourable bounty shall belong:
28: Go to the Douglas, and deliver him
29: Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free:
30: His valour shown upon our crests to-day
31: Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
32: Even in the bosom of our adversaries.
33: LANCASTER: I thank your grace for this high courtesy,
34: Which I shall give away immediately.
