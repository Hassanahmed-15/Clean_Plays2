ACT 1 SCENE 1

1: KING JOHN: Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?
2: CHATILLON: Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France
3: In my behavior to the majesty,
4: The borrow'd majesty, of England here.
5: QUEEN ELINOR: A strange beginning: 'borrow'd majesty!'
6: KING JOHN: Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.
7: CHATILLON: Philip of France, in right and true behalf
8: Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,
9: Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim
10: To this fair island and the territories,
11: To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,
12: Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
13: Which sways usurpingly these several titles,
14: And put these same into young Arthur's hand,
15: Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.
16: KING JOHN: What follows if we disallow of this?
17: CHATILLON: The proud control of fierce and bloody war,
18: To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.
19: KING JOHN: Here have we war for war and blood for blood,
20: Controlment for controlment: so answer France.
21: CHATILLON: Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,
22: The farthest limit of my embassy.
23: KING JOHN: Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:
24: Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;
25: For ere thou canst report I will be there,
26: The thunder of my cannon shall be heard:
27: So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath
28: And sullen presage of your own decay.
29: An honourable conduct let him have:
30: Pembroke, look to 't. Farewell, Chatillon.
31: QUEEN ELINOR: What now, my son! have I not ever said
32: How that ambitious Constance would not cease
33: Till she had kindled France and all the world,
34: Upon the right and party of her son?
35: This might have been prevented and made whole
36: With very easy arguments of love,
37: Which now the manage of two kingdoms must
38: With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.
39: KING JOHN: Our strong possession and our right for us.
40: QUEEN ELINOR: Your strong possession much more than your right,
41: Or else it must go wrong with you and me:
42: So much my conscience whispers in your ear,
43: Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.
44: ESSEX: My liege, here is the strangest controversy
45: Come from country to be judged by you,
46: That e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?
47: KING JOHN: Let them approach.
48: Our abbeys and our priories shall pay
49: This expedition's charge.
50: What men are you?
51: BASTARD: Your faithful subject I, a gentleman
52: Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,
53: As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,
54: A soldier, by the honour-giving hand
55: Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.
56: KING JOHN: What art thou?
57: ROBERT: The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.
58: KING JOHN: Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
59: You came not of one mother then, it seems.
60: BASTARD: Most certain of one mother, mighty king;
61: That is well known; and, as I think, one father:
62: But for the certain knowledge of that truth
63: I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:
64: Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.
65: QUEEN ELINOR: Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother
66: And wound her honour with this diffidence.
67: BASTARD: I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;
68: That is my brother's plea and none of mine;
69: The which if he can prove, a' pops me out
70: At least from fair five hundred pound a year:
71: Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!
72: KING JOHN: A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
73: Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?
74: BASTARD: I know not why, except to get the land.
75: But once he slander'd me with bastardy:
76: But whether I be as true begot or no,
77: That still I lay upon my mother's head,
78: But that I am as well begot, my liege,--
79: Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--
80: Compare our faces and be judge yourself.
81: If old sir Robert did beget us both
82: And were our father and this son like him,
83: O old sir Robert, father, on my knee
84: I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!
85: KING JOHN: Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
86: QUEEN ELINOR: He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;
87: The accent of his tongue affecteth him.
88: Do you not read some tokens of my son
89: In the large composition of this man?
90: KING JOHN: Mine eye hath well examined his parts
91: And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,
92: What doth move you to claim your brother's land?
93: BASTARD: Because he hath a half-face, like my father.
94: With half that face would he have all my land:
95: A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!
96: ROBERT: My gracious liege, when that my father lived,
97: Your brother did employ my father much,--
98: BASTARD: Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:
99: Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.
100: ROBERT: And once dispatch'd him in an embassy
101: To Germany, there with the emperor
102: To treat of high affairs touching that time.
103: The advantage of his absence took the king
104: And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;
105: Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,
106: But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores
107: Between my father and my mother lay,
108: As I have heard my father speak himself,
109: When this same lusty gentleman was got.
110: Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd
111: His lands to me, and took it on his death
112: That this my mother's son was none of his;
113: And if he were, he came into the world
114: Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
115: Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
116: My father's land, as was my father's will.
117: KING JOHN: Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;
118: Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,
119: And if she did play false, the fault was hers;
120: Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
121: That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,
122: Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,
123: Had of your father claim'd this son for his?
124: In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
125: This calf bred from his cow from all the world;
126: In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's,
127: My brother might not claim him; nor your father,
128: Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;
129: My mother's son did get your father's heir;
130: Your father's heir must have your father's land.
131: ROBERT: Shall then my father's will be of no force
132: To dispossess that child which is not his?
133: BASTARD: Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
134: Than was his will to get me, as I think.
135: QUEEN ELINOR: Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge
136: And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,
137: Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,
138: Lord of thy presence and no land beside?
139: BASTARD: Madam, an if my brother had my shape,
140: And I had his, sir Robert's his, like him;
141: And if my legs were two such riding-rods,
142: My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin
143: That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
144: Lest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'
145: And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,
146: Would I might never stir from off this place,
147: I would give it every foot to have this face;
148: I would not be sir Nob in any case.
149: QUEEN ELINOR: I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
150: Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?
151: I am a soldier and now bound to France.
152: BASTARD: Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
153: Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,
154: Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.
155: Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.
156: QUEEN ELINOR: Nay, I would have you go before me thither.
157: BASTARD: Our country manners give our betters way.
158: KING JOHN: What is thy name?
159: BASTARD: Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,
160: Philip, good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son.
161: KING JOHN: From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear'st:
162: Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,
163: Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.
164: BASTARD: Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand:
165: My father gave me honour, yours gave land.
166: Now blessed by the hour, by night or day,
167: When I was got, sir Robert was away!
168: QUEEN ELINOR: The very spirit of Plantagenet!
169: I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.
170: BASTARD: Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?
171: Something about, a little from the right,
172: In at the window, or else o'er the hatch:
173: Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,
174: And have is have, however men do catch:
175: Near or far off, well won is still well shot,
176: And I am I, howe'er I was begot.
177: KING JOHN: Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;
178: A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
179: Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed
180: For France, for France, for it is more than need.
181: BASTARD: Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!
182: For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.
183: A foot of honour better than I was;
184: But many a many foot of land the worse.
185: Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
186: 'Good den, sir Richard!'--'God-a-mercy, fellow!'--
187: And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
188: For new-made honour doth forget men's names;
189: 'Tis too respective and too sociable
190: For your conversion. Now your traveller,
191: He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,
192: And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,
193: Why then I suck my teeth and catechise
194: My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'
195: Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,
196: 'I shall beseech you'--that is question now;
197: And then comes answer like an Absey book:
198: 'O sir,' says answer, 'at your best command;
199: At your employment; at your service, sir;'
200: 'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'
201: And so, ere answer knows what question would,
202: Saving in dialogue of compliment,
203: And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
204: The Pyrenean and the river Po,
205: It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
206: But this is worshipful society
207: And fits the mounting spirit like myself,
208: For he is but a bastard to the time
209: That doth not smack of observation;
210: And so am I, whether I smack or no;
211: And not alone in habit and device,
212: Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
213: But from the inward motion to deliver
214: Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:
215: Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
216: Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
217: For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
218: But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
219: What woman-post is this? hath she no husband
220: That will take pains to blow a horn before her?
221: O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!
222: What brings you here to court so hastily?
223: LADY FAULCONBRIDGE: Where is that slave, thy brother? where is he,
224: That holds in chase mine honour up and down?
225: BASTARD: My brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?
226: Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?
227: Is it sir Robert's son that you seek so?
228: LADY FAULCONBRIDGE: Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,
229: Sir Robert's son: why scorn'st thou at sir Robert?
230: He is sir Robert's son, and so art thou.
231: BASTARD: James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?
232: GURNEY: Good leave, good Philip.
233: BASTARD: Philip! sparrow: James,
234: There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.
235: Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:
236: Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
237: Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:
238: Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,
239: Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:
240: We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,
241: To whom am I beholding for these limbs?
242: Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.
243: LADY FAULCONBRIDGE: Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,
244: That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?
245: What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?
246: BASTARD: Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.
247: What! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder.
248: But, mother, I am not sir Robert's son;
249: I have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land;
250: Legitimation, name and all is gone:
251: Then, good my mother, let me know my father;
252: Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?
253: LADY FAULCONBRIDGE: Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?
254: BASTARD: As faithfully as I deny the devil.
255: LADY FAULCONBRIDGE: King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:
256: By long and vehement suit I was seduced
257: To make room for him in my husband's bed:
258: Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!
259: Thou art the issue of my dear offence,
260: Which was so strongly urged past my defence.
ACT 2 SCENE 1

1: LEWIS: Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.
2: Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,
3: Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart
4: And fought the holy wars in Palestine,
5: By this brave duke came early to his grave:
6: And for amends to his posterity,
7: At our importance hither is he come,
8: To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf,
9: And to rebuke the usurpation
10: Of thy unnatural uncle, English John:
11: Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.
12: ARTHUR: God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death
13: The rather that you give his offspring life,
14: Shadowing their right under your wings of war:
15: I give you welcome with a powerless hand,
16: But with a heart full of unstained love:
17: Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke.
18: LEWIS: A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?
19: AUSTRIA: Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
20: As seal to this indenture of my love,
21: That to my home I will no more return,
22: Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,
23: Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,
24: Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides
25: And coops from other lands her islanders,
26: Even till that England, hedged in with the main,
27: That water-walled bulwark, still secure
28: And confident from foreign purposes,
29: Even till that utmost corner of the west
30: Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,
31: Will I not think of home, but follow arms.
32: CONSTANCE: O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,
33: Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
34: To make a more requital to your love!
35: AUSTRIA: The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
36: In such a just and charitable war.
37: KING PHILIP: Well then, to work: our cannon shall be bent
38: Against the brows of this resisting town.
39: Call for our chiefest men of discipline,
40: To cull the plots of best advantages:
41: We'll lay before this town our royal bones,
42: Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood,
43: But we will make it subject to this boy.
44: CONSTANCE: Stay for an answer to your embassy,
45: Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood:
46: My Lord Chatillon may from England bring,
47: That right in peace which here we urge in war,
48: And then we shall repent each drop of blood
49: That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.
50: KING PHILIP: A wonder, lady! lo, upon thy wish,
51: Our messenger Chatillon is arrived!
52: What England says, say briefly, gentle lord;
53: We coldly pause for thee; Chatillon, speak.
54: CHATILLON: Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
55: And stir them up against a mightier task.
56: England, impatient of your just demands,
57: Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,
58: Whose leisure I have stay'd, have given him time
59: To land his legions all as soon as I;
60: His marches are expedient to this town,
61: His forces strong, his soldiers confident.
62: With him along is come the mother-queen,
63: An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;
64: With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain;
65: With them a bastard of the king's deceased,
66: And all the unsettled humours of the land,
67: Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,
68: With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens,
69: Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,
70: Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,
71: To make hazard of new fortunes here:
72: In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits
73: Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er
74: Did nearer float upon the swelling tide,
75: To do offence and scath in Christendom.
76: The interruption of their churlish drums
77: Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand,
78: To parley or to fight; therefore prepare.
79: KING PHILIP: How much unlook'd for is this expedition!
80: AUSTRIA: By how much unexpected, by so much
81: We must awake endavour for defence;
82: For courage mounteth with occasion:
83: Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.
84: KING JOHN: Peace be to France, if France in peace permit
85: Our just and lineal entrance to our own;
86: If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,
87: Whiles we, God's wrathful agent, do correct
88: Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven.
89: KING PHILIP: Peace be to England, if that war return
90: From France to England, there to live in peace.
91: England we love; and for that England's sake
92: With burden of our armour here we sweat.
93: This toil of ours should be a work of thine;
94: But thou from loving England art so far,
95: That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king
96: Cut off the sequence of posterity,
97: Out-faced infant state and done a rape
98: Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.
99: Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face;
100: These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his:
101: This little abstract doth contain that large
102: Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time
103: Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.
104: That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,
105: And this his son; England was Geffrey's right
106: And this is Geffrey's: in the name of God
107: How comes it then that thou art call'd a king,
108: When living blood doth in these temples beat,
109: Which owe the crown that thou o'ermasterest?
110: KING JOHN: From whom hast thou this great commission, France,
111: To draw my answer from thy articles?
112: KING PHILIP: From that supernal judge, that stirs good thoughts
113: In any breast of strong authority,
114: To look into the blots and stains of right:
115: That judge hath made me guardian to this boy:
116: Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong
117: And by whose help I mean to chastise it.
118: KING JOHN: Alack, thou dost usurp authority.
119: KING PHILIP: Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
120: QUEEN ELINOR: Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?
121: CONSTANCE: Let me make answer; thy usurping son.
122: QUEEN ELINOR: Out, insolent! thy bastard shall be king,
123: That thou mayst be a queen, and cheque the world!
124: CONSTANCE: My bed was ever to thy son as true
125: As thine was to thy husband; and this boy
126: Liker in feature to his father Geffrey
127: Than thou and John in manners; being as like
128: As rain to water, or devil to his dam.
129: My boy a bastard! By my soul, I think
130: His father never was so true begot:
131: It cannot be, an if thou wert his mother.
132: QUEEN ELINOR: There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.
133: CONSTANCE: There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.
134: AUSTRIA: Peace!
135: BASTARD: Hear the crier.
136: AUSTRIA: What the devil art thou?
137: BASTARD: One that will play the devil, sir, with you,
138: An a' may catch your hide and you alone:
139: You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,
140: Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard;
141: I'll smoke your skin-coat, an I catch you right;
142: Sirrah, look to't; i' faith, I will, i' faith.
143: BLANCH: O, well did he become that lion's robe
144: That did disrobe the lion of that robe!
145: BASTARD: It lies as sightly on the back of him
146: As great Alcides' shows upon an ass:
147: But, ass, I'll take that burthen from your back,
148: Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.
149: AUSTRIA: What craker is this same that deafs our ears
150: With this abundance of superfluous breath?
151: KING PHILIP: Lewis, determine what we shall do straight.
152: LEWIS: Women and fools, break off your conference.
153: King John, this is the very sum of all;
154: England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,
155: In right of Arthur do I claim of thee:
156: Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?
157: KING JOHN: My life as soon: I do defy thee, France.
158: Arthur of Bretagne, yield thee to my hand;
159: And out of my dear love I'll give thee more
160: Than e'er the coward hand of France can win:
161: Submit thee, boy.
162: QUEEN ELINOR: Come to thy grandam, child.
163: CONSTANCE: Do, child, go to it grandam, child:
164: Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will
165: Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig:
166: There's a good grandam.
167: ARTHUR: Good my mother, peace!
168: I would that I were low laid in my grave:
169: I am not worth this coil that's made for me.
170: QUEEN ELINOR: His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.
171: CONSTANCE: Now shame upon you, whether she does or no!
172: His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,
173: Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,
174: Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;
175: Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed
176: To do him justice and revenge on you.
177: QUEEN ELINOR: Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!
178: CONSTANCE: Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth!
179: Call not me slanderer; thou and thine usurp
180: The dominations, royalties and rights
181: Of this oppressed boy: this is thy eld'st son's son,
182: Infortunate in nothing but in thee:
183: Thy sins are visited in this poor child;
184: The canon of the law is laid on him,
185: Being but the second generation
186: Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.
187: KING JOHN: Bedlam, have done.
188: CONSTANCE: I have but this to say,
189: That he is not only plagued for her sin,
190: But God hath made her sin and her the plague
191: On this removed issue, plague for her
192: And with her plague; her sin his injury,
193: Her injury the beadle to her sin,
194: All punish'd in the person of this child,
195: And all for her; a plague upon her!
196: QUEEN ELINOR: Thou unadvised scold, I can produce
197: A will that bars the title of thy son.
198: CONSTANCE: Ay, who doubts that? a will! a wicked will:
199: A woman's will; a canker'd grandam's will!
200: KING PHILIP: Peace, lady! pause, or be more temperate:
201: It ill beseems this presence to cry aim
202: To these ill-tuned repetitions.
203: Some trumpet summon hither to the walls
204: These men of Angiers: let us hear them speak
205: Whose title they admit, Arthur's or John's.
206: First Citizen: Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?
207: KING PHILIP: 'Tis France, for England.
208: KING JOHN: England, for itself.
209: You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects--
210: KING PHILIP: You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects,
211: Our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle--
212: KING JOHN: For our advantage; therefore hear us first.
213: These flags of France, that are advanced here
214: Before the eye and prospect of your town,
215: Have hither march'd to your endamagement:
216: The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,
217: And ready mounted are they to spit forth
218: Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls:
219: All preparation for a bloody siege
220: All merciless proceeding by these French
221: Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;
222: And but for our approach those sleeping stones,
223: That as a waist doth girdle you about,
224: By the compulsion of their ordinance
225: By this time from their fixed beds of lime
226: Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made
227: For bloody power to rush upon your peace.
228: But on the sight of us your lawful king,
229: Who painfully with much expedient march
230: Have brought a countercheque before your gates,
231: To save unscratch'd your city's threatened cheeks,
232: Behold, the French amazed vouchsafe a parle;
233: And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,
234: To make a shaking fever in your walls,
235: They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,
236: To make a faithless error in your ears:
237: Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,
238: And let us in, your king, whose labour'd spirits,
239: Forwearied in this action of swift speed,
240: Crave harbourage within your city walls.
241: KING PHILIP: When I have said, make answer to us both.
242: Lo, in this right hand, whose protection
243: Is most divinely vow'd upon the right
244: Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,
245: Son to the elder brother of this man,
246: And king o'er him and all that he enjoys:
247: For this down-trodden equity, we tread
248: In warlike march these greens before your town,
249: Being no further enemy to you
250: Than the constraint of hospitable zeal
251: In the relief of this oppressed child
252: Religiously provokes. Be pleased then
253: To pay that duty which you truly owe
254: To that owes it, namely this young prince:
255: And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,
256: Save in aspect, hath all offence seal'd up;
257: Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent
258: Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven;
259: And with a blessed and unvex'd retire,
260: With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruised,
261: We will bear home that lusty blood again
262: Which here we came to spout against your town,
263: And leave your children, wives and you in peace.
264: But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer,
265: 'Tis not the roundure of your old-faced walls
266: Can hide you from our messengers of war,
267: Though all these English and their discipline
268: Were harbour'd in their rude circumference.
269: Then tell us, shall your city call us lord,
270: In that behalf which we have challenged it?
271: Or shall we give the signal to our rage
272: And stalk in blood to our possession?
273: First Citizen: In brief, we are the king of England's subjects:
274: For him, and in his right, we hold this town.
275: KING JOHN: Acknowledge then the king, and let me in.
276: First Citizen: That can we not; but he that proves the king,
277: To him will we prove loyal: till that time
278: Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world.
279: KING JOHN: Doth not the crown of England prove the king?
280: And if not that, I bring you witnesses,
281: Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed,--
282: BASTARD: Bastards, and else.
283: KING JOHN: To verify our title with their lives.
284: KING PHILIP: As many and as well-born bloods as those,--
285: BASTARD: Some bastards too.
286: KING PHILIP: Stand in his face to contradict his claim.
287: First Citizen: Till you compound whose right is worthiest,
288: We for the worthiest hold the right from both.
289: KING JOHN: Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
290: That to their everlasting residence,
291: Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet,
292: In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king!
293: KING PHILIP: Amen, amen! Mount, chevaliers! to arms!
294: BASTARD: Saint George, that swinged the dragon, and e'er since
295: Sits on his horseback at mine hostess' door,
296: Teach us some fence!
297: Sirrah, were I at home,
298: At your den, sirrah, with your lioness
299: I would set an ox-head to your lion's hide,
300: And make a monster of you.
301: AUSTRIA: Peace! no more.
302: BASTARD: O tremble, for you hear the lion roar.
303: KING JOHN: Up higher to the plain; where we'll set forth
304: In best appointment all our regiments.
305: BASTARD: Speed then, to take advantage of the field.
306: KING PHILIP: It shall be so; and at the other hill
307: Command the rest to stand. God and our right!
308: French Herald: You men of Angiers, open wide your gates,
309: And let young Arthur, Duke of Bretagne, in,
310: Who by the hand of France this day hath made
311: Much work for tears in many an English mother,
312: Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground;
313: Many a widow's husband grovelling lies,
314: Coldly embracing the discolour'd earth;
315: And victory, with little loss, doth play
316: Upon the dancing banners of the French,
317: Who are at hand, triumphantly display'd,
318: To enter conquerors and to proclaim
319: Arthur of Bretagne England's king and yours.
320: English Herald: Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
321: King John, your king and England's doth approach,
322: Commander of this hot malicious day:
323: Their armours, that march'd hence so silver-bright,
324: Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood;
325: There stuck no plume in any English crest
326: That is removed by a staff of France;
327: Our colours do return in those same hands
328: That did display them when we first march'd forth;
329: And, like a troop of jolly huntsmen, come
330: Our lusty English, all with purpled hands,
331: Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:
332: Open your gates and gives the victors way.
333: First Citizen: Heralds, from off our towers we might behold,
334: From first to last, the onset and retire
335: Of both your armies; whose equality
336: By our best eyes cannot be censured:
337: Blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows;
338: Strength match'd with strength, and power confronted power:
339: Both are alike; and both alike we like.
340: One must prove greatest: while they weigh so even,
341: We hold our town for neither, yet for both.
342: KING JOHN: France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?
343: Say, shall the current of our right run on?
344: Whose passage, vex'd with thy impediment,
345: Shall leave his native channel and o'erswell
346: With course disturb'd even thy confining shores,
347: Unless thou let his silver water keep
348: A peaceful progress to the ocean.
349: KING PHILIP: England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
350: In this hot trial, more than we of France;
351: Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,
352: That sways the earth this climate overlooks,
353: Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,
354: We'll put thee down, 'gainst whom these arms we bear,
355: Or add a royal number to the dead,
356: Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss
357: With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.
358: BASTARD: Ha, majesty! how high thy glory towers,
359: When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!
360: O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel;
361: The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;
362: And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,
363: In undetermined differences of kings.
364: Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?
365: Cry, 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field,
366: You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits!
367: Then let confusion of one part confirm
368: The other's peace: till then, blows, blood and death!
369: KING JOHN: Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?
370: KING PHILIP: Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?
371: First Citizen: The king of England; when we know the king.
372: KING PHILIP: Know him in us, that here hold up his right.
373: KING JOHN: In us, that are our own great deputy
374: And bear possession of our person here,
375: Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.
376: First Citizen: A greater power then we denies all this;
377: And till it be undoubted, we do lock
378: Our former scruple in our strong-barr'd gates;
379: King'd of our fears, until our fears, resolved,
380: Be by some certain king purged and deposed.
381: BASTARD: By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,
382: And stand securely on their battlements,
383: As in a theatre, whence they gape and point
384: At your industrious scenes and acts of death.
385: Your royal presences be ruled by me:
386: Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,
387: Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
388: Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town:
389: By east and west let France and England mount
390: Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,
391: Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down
392: The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:
393: I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,
394: Even till unfenced desolation
395: Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.
396: That done, dissever your united strengths,
397: And part your mingled colours once again;
398: Turn face to face and bloody point to point;
399: Then, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth
400: Out of one side her happy minion,
401: To whom in favour she shall give the day,
402: And kiss him with a glorious victory.
403: How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?
404: Smacks it not something of the policy?
405: KING JOHN: Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,
406: I like it well. France, shall we knit our powers
407: And lay this Angiers even to the ground;
408: Then after fight who shall be king of it?
409: BASTARD: An if thou hast the mettle of a king,
410: Being wronged as we are by this peevish town,
411: Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,
412: As we will ours, against these saucy walls;
413: And when that we have dash'd them to the ground,
414: Why then defy each other and pell-mell
415: Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.
416: KING PHILIP: Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
417: KING JOHN: We from the west will send destruction
418: Into this city's bosom.
419: AUSTRIA: I from the north.
420: KING PHILIP: Our thunder from the south
421: Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.
422: BASTARD: O prudent discipline! From north to south:
423: Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth:
424: I'll stir them to it. Come, away, away!
425: First Citizen: Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,
426: And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league;
427: Win you this city without stroke or wound;
428: Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,
429: That here come sacrifices for the field:
430: Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.
431: KING JOHN: Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.
432: First Citizen: That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,
433: Is niece to England: look upon the years
434: Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:
435: If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,
436: Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?
437: If zealous love should go in search of virtue,
438: Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?
439: If love ambitious sought a match of birth,
440: Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?
441: Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,
442: Is the young Dauphin every way complete:
443: If not complete of, say he is not she;
444: And she again wants nothing, to name want,
445: If want it be not that she is not he:
446: He is the half part of a blessed man,
447: Left to be finished by such as she;
448: And she a fair divided excellence,
449: Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.
450: O, two such silver currents, when they join,
451: Do glorify the banks that bound them in;
452: And two such shores to two such streams made one,
453: Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,
454: To these two princes, if you marry them.
455: This union shall do more than battery can
456: To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,
457: With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,
458: The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,
459: And give you entrance: but without this match,
460: The sea enraged is not half so deaf,
461: Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
462: More free from motion, no, not Death himself
463: In moral fury half so peremptory,
464: As we to keep this city.
465: BASTARD: Here's a stay
466: That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
467: Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,
468: That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,
469: Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
470: As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!
471: What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?
472: He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce;
473: He gives the bastinado with his tongue:
474: Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
475: But buffets better than a fist of France:
476: Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words
477: Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.
478: QUEEN ELINOR: Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;
479: Give with our niece a dowry large enough:
480: For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
481: Thy now unsured assurance to the crown,
482: That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
483: The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.
484: I see a yielding in the looks of France;
485: Mark, how they whisper: urge them while their souls
486: Are capable of this ambition,
487: Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
488: Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,
489: Cool and congeal again to what it was.
490: First Citizen: Why answer not the double majesties
491: This friendly treaty of our threaten'd town?
492: KING PHILIP: Speak England first, that hath been forward first
493: To speak unto this city: what say you?
494: KING JOHN: If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,
495: Can in this book of beauty read 'I love,'
496: Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen:
497: For Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,
498: And all that we upon this side the sea,
499: Except this city now by us besieged,
500: Find liable to our crown and dignity,
501: Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
502: In titles, honours and promotions,
503: As she in beauty, education, blood,
504: Holds hand with any princess of the world.
505: KING PHILIP: What say'st thou, boy? look in the lady's face.
506: LEWIS: I do, my lord; and in her eye I find
507: A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,
508: The shadow of myself form'd in her eye:
509: Which being but the shadow of your son,
510: Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow:
511: I do protest I never loved myself
512: Till now infixed I beheld myself
513: Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.
514: BASTARD: Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!
515: Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!
516: And quarter'd in her heart! he doth espy
517: Himself love's traitor: this is pity now,
518: That hang'd and drawn and quartered, there should be
519: In such a love so vile a lout as he.
520: BLANCH: My uncle's will in this respect is mine:
521: If he see aught in you that makes him like,
522: That any thing he sees, which moves his liking,
523: I can with ease translate it to my will;
524: Or if you will, to speak more properly,
525: I will enforce it easily to my love.
526: Further I will not flatter you, my lord,
527: That all I see in you is worthy love,
528: Than this; that nothing do I see in you,
529: Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,
530: That I can find should merit any hate.
531: KING JOHN: What say these young ones? What say you my niece?
532: BLANCH: That she is bound in honour still to do
533: What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.
534: KING JOHN: Speak then, prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?
535: LEWIS: Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;
536: For I do love her most unfeignedly.
537: KING JOHN: Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,
538: Poictiers and Anjou, these five provinces,
539: With her to thee; and this addition more,
540: Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.
541: Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,
542: Command thy son and daughter to join hands.
543: KING PHILIP: It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.
544: AUSTRIA: And your lips too; for I am well assured
545: That I did so when I was first assured.
546: KING PHILIP: Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,
547: Let in that amity which you have made;
548: For at Saint Mary's chapel presently
549: The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.
550: Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?
551: I know she is not, for this match made up
552: Her presence would have interrupted much:
553: Where is she and her son? tell me, who knows.
554: LEWIS: She is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.
555: KING PHILIP: And, by my faith, this league that we have made
556: Will give her sadness very little cure.
557: Brother of England, how may we content
558: This widow lady? In her right we came;
559: Which we, God knows, have turn'd another way,
560: To our own vantage.
561: KING JOHN: We will heal up all;
562: For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne
563: And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town
564: We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;
565: Some speedy messenger bid her repair
566: To our solemnity: I trust we shall,
567: If not fill up the measure of her will,
568: Yet in some measure satisfy her so
569: That we shall stop her exclamation.
570: Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,
571: To this unlook'd for, unprepared pomp.
ACT 3 SCENE 1

1: CONSTANCE: Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!
2: False blood to false blood join'd! gone to be friends!
3: Shall Lewis have Blanch, and Blanch those provinces?
4: It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard:
5: Be well advised, tell o'er thy tale again:
6: It cannot be; thou dost but say 'tis so:
7: I trust I may not trust thee; for thy word
8: Is but the vain breath of a common man:
9: Believe me, I do not believe thee, man;
10: I have a king's oath to the contrary.
11: Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,
12: For I am sick and capable of fears,
13: Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears,
14: A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,
15: A woman, naturally born to fears;
16: And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,
17: With my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce,
18: But they will quake and tremble all this day.
19: What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?
20: Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?
21: What means that hand upon that breast of thine?
22: Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,
23: Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?
24: Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?
25: Then speak again; not all thy former tale,
26: But this one word, whether thy tale be true.
27: SALISBURY: As true as I believe you think them false
28: That give you cause to prove my saying true.
29: CONSTANCE: O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,
30: Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,
31: And let belief and life encounter so
32: As doth the fury of two desperate men
33: Which in the very meeting fall and die.
34: Lewis marry Blanch! O boy, then where art thou?
35: France friend with England, what becomes of me?
36: Fellow, be gone: I cannot brook thy sight:
37: This news hath made thee a most ugly man.
38: SALISBURY: What other harm have I, good lady, done,
39: But spoke the harm that is by others done?
40: CONSTANCE: Which harm within itself so heinous is
41: As it makes harmful all that speak of it.
42: ARTHUR: I do beseech you, madam, be content.
43: CONSTANCE: If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,
44: Ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb,
45: Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,
46: Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,
47: Patch'd with foul moles and eye-offending marks,
48: I would not care, I then would be content,
49: For then I should not love thee, no, nor thou
50: Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown.
51: But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,
52: Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:
53: Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,
54: And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,
55: She is corrupted, changed and won from thee;
56: She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,
57: And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France
58: To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,
59: And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.
60: France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,
61: That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!
62: Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?
63: Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
64: And leave those woes alone which I alone
65: Am bound to under-bear.
66: SALISBURY: Pardon me, madam,
67: I may not go without you to the kings.
68: CONSTANCE: Thou mayst, thou shalt; I will not go with thee:
69: I will instruct my sorrows to be proud;
70: For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.
71: To me and to the state of my great grief
72: Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great
73: That no supporter but the huge firm earth
74: Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit;
75: Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it.
76: KING PHILIP: 'Tis true, fair daughter; and this blessed day
77: Ever in France shall be kept festival:
78: To solemnize this day the glorious sun
79: Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,
80: Turning with splendor of his precious eye
81: The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold:
82: The yearly course that brings this day about
83: Shall never see it but a holiday.
84: CONSTANCE: A wicked day, and not a holy day!
85: What hath this day deserved? what hath it done,
86: That it in golden letters should be set
87: Among the high tides in the calendar?
88: Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
89: This day of shame, oppression, perjury.
90: Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child
91: Pray that their burthens may not fall this day,
92: Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd:
93: But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;
94: No bargains break that are not this day made:
95: This day, all things begun come to ill end,
96: Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!
97: KING PHILIP: By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause
98: To curse the fair proceedings of this day:
99: Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty?
100: CONSTANCE: You have beguiled me with a counterfeit
101: Resembling majesty, which, being touch'd and tried,
102: Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn;
103: You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,
104: But now in arms you strengthen it with yours:
105: The grappling vigour and rough frown of war
106: Is cold in amity and painted peace,
107: And our oppression hath made up this league.
108: Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured kings!
109: A widow cries; be husband to me, heavens!
110: Let not the hours of this ungodly day
111: Wear out the day in peace; but, ere sunset,
112: Set armed discord 'twixt these perjured kings!
113: Hear me, O, hear me!
114: AUSTRIA: Lady Constance, peace!
115: CONSTANCE: War! war! no peace! peace is to me a war
116: O Lymoges! O Austria! thou dost shame
117: That bloody spoil: thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!
118: Thou little valiant, great in villany!
119: Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!
120: Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight
121: But when her humorous ladyship is by
122: To teach thee safety! thou art perjured too,
123: And soothest up greatness. What a fool art thou,
124: A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
125: Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
126: Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,
127: Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend
128: Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,
129: And dost thou now fall over to my fores?
130: Thou wear a lion's hide! doff it for shame,
131: And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
132: AUSTRIA: O, that a man should speak those words to me!
133: BASTARD: And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
134: AUSTRIA: Thou darest not say so, villain, for thy life.
135: BASTARD: And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
136: KING JOHN: We like not this; thou dost forget thyself.
137: KING PHILIP: Here comes the holy legate of the pope.
138: CARDINAL PANDULPH: Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!
139: To thee, King John, my holy errand is.
140: I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,
141: And from Pope Innocent the legate here,
142: Do in his name religiously demand
143: Why thou against the church, our holy mother,
144: So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce
145: Keep Stephen Langton, chosen archbishop
146: Of Canterbury, from that holy see?
147: This, in our foresaid holy father's name,
148: Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.
149: KING JOHN: What earthy name to interrogatories
150: Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
151: Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name
152: So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,
153: To charge me to an answer, as the pope.
154: Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England
155: Add thus much more, that no Italian priest
156: Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;
157: But as we, under heaven, are supreme head,
158: So under Him that great supremacy,
159: Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,
160: Without the assistance of a mortal hand:
161: So tell the pope, all reverence set apart
162: To him and his usurp'd authority.
163: KING PHILIP: Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.
164: KING JOHN: Though you and all the kings of Christendom
165: Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,
166: Dreading the curse that money may buy out;
167: And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,
168: Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,
169: Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,
170: Though you and all the rest so grossly led
171: This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,
172: Yet I alone, alone do me oppose
173: Against the pope and count his friends my foes.
174: CARDINAL PANDULPH: Then, by the lawful power that I have,
175: Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate.
176: And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
177: From his allegiance to an heretic;
178: And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,
179: Canonized and worshipped as a saint,
180: That takes away by any secret course
181: Thy hateful life.
182: CONSTANCE: O, lawful let it be
183: That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!
184: Good father cardinal, cry thou amen
185: To my keen curses; for without my wrong
186: There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.
187: CARDINAL PANDULPH: There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.
188: CONSTANCE: And for mine too: when law can do no right,
189: Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong:
190: Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,
191: For he that holds his kingdom holds the law;
192: Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,
193: How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
194: CARDINAL PANDULPH: Philip of France, on peril of a curse,
195: Let go the hand of that arch-heretic;
196: And raise the power of France upon his head,
197: Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
198: QUEEN ELINOR: Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.
199: CONSTANCE: Look to that, devil; lest that France repent,
200: And by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul.
201: AUSTRIA: King Philip, listen to the cardinal.
202: BASTARD: And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.
203: AUSTRIA: Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs, Because--
204: BASTARD: Your breeches best may carry them.
205: KING JOHN: Philip, what say'st thou to the cardinal?
206: CONSTANCE: What should he say, but as the cardinal?
207: LEWIS: Bethink you, father; for the difference
208: Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,
209: Or the light loss of England for a friend:
210: Forego the easier.
211: BLANCH: That's the curse of Rome.
212: CONSTANCE: O Lewis, stand fast! the devil tempts thee here
213: In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.
214: BLANCH: The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,
215: But from her need.
216: CONSTANCE: O, if thou grant my need,
217: Which only lives but by the death of faith,
218: That need must needs infer this principle,
219: That faith would live again by death of need.
220: O then, tread down my need, and faith mounts up;
221: Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!
222: KING JOHN: The king is moved, and answers not to this.
223: CONSTANCE: O, be removed from him, and answer well!
224: AUSTRIA: Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
225: BASTARD: Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.
226: KING PHILIP: I am perplex'd, and know not what to say.
227: CARDINAL PANDULPH: What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,
228: If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?
229: KING PHILIP: Good reverend father, make my person yours,
230: And tell me how you would bestow yourself.
231: This royal hand and mine are newly knit,
232: And the conjunction of our inward souls
233: Married in league, coupled and linked together
234: With all religious strength of sacred vows;
235: The latest breath that gave the sound of words
236: Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love
237: Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,
238: And even before this truce, but new before,
239: No longer than we well could wash our hands
240: To clap this royal bargain up of peace,
241: Heaven knows, they were besmear'd and over-stain'd
242: With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint
243: The fearful difference of incensed kings:
244: And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,
245: So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,
246: Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?
247: Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,
248: Make such unconstant children of ourselves,
249: As now again to snatch our palm from palm,
250: Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed
251: Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,
252: And make a riot on the gentle brow
253: Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,
254: My reverend father, let it not be so!
255: Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose
256: Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest
257: To do your pleasure and continue friends.
258: CARDINAL PANDULPH: All form is formless, order orderless,
259: Save what is opposite to England's love.
260: Therefore to arms! be champion of our church,
261: Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,
262: A mother's curse, on her revolting son.
263: France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,
264: A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
265: A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
266: Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.
267: KING PHILIP: I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.
268: CARDINAL PANDULPH: So makest thou faith an enemy to faith;
269: And like a civil war set'st oath to oath,
270: Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow
271: First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,
272: That is, to be the champion of our church!
273: What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself
274: And may not be performed by thyself,
275: For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
276: Is not amiss when it is truly done,
277: And being not done, where doing tends to ill,
278: The truth is then most done not doing it:
279: The better act of purposes mistook
280: Is to mistake again; though indirect,
281: Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
282: And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
283: Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.
284: It is religion that doth make vows kept;
285: But thou hast sworn against religion,
286: By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,
287: And makest an oath the surety for thy truth
288: Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure
289: To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;
290: Else what a mockery should it be to swear!
291: But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;
292: And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.
293: Therefore thy later vows against thy first
294: Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;
295: And better conquest never canst thou make
296: Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
297: Against these giddy loose suggestions:
298: Upon which better part our prayers come in,
299: If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know
300: The peril of our curses light on thee
301: So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,
302: But in despair die under their black weight.
303: AUSTRIA: Rebellion, flat rebellion!
304: BASTARD: Will't not be?
305: Will not a calfs-skin stop that mouth of thine?
306: LEWIS: Father, to arms!
307: BLANCH: Upon thy wedding-day?
308: Against the blood that thou hast married?
309: What, shall our feast be kept with slaughter'd men?
310: Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,
311: Clamours of hell, be measures to our pomp?
312: O husband, hear me! ay, alack, how new
313: Is husband in my mouth! even for that name,
314: Which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce,
315: Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms
316: Against mine uncle.
317: CONSTANCE: O, upon my knee,
318: Made hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee,
319: Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom
320: Forethought by heaven!
321: BLANCH: Now shall I see thy love: what motive may
322: Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?
323: CONSTANCE: That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,
324: His honour: O, thine honour, Lewis, thine honour!
325: LEWIS: I muse your majesty doth seem so cold,
326: When such profound respects do pull you on.
327: CARDINAL PANDULPH: I will denounce a curse upon his head.
328: KING PHILIP: Thou shalt not need. England, I will fall from thee.
329: CONSTANCE: O fair return of banish'd majesty!
330: QUEEN ELINOR: O foul revolt of French inconstancy!
331: KING JOHN: France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.
332: BASTARD: Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,
333: Is it as he will? well then, France shall rue.
334: BLANCH: The sun's o'ercast with blood: fair day, adieu!
335: Which is the side that I must go withal?
336: I am with both: each army hath a hand;
337: And in their rage, I having hold of both,
338: They swirl asunder and dismember me.
339: Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win;
340: Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;
341: Father, I may not wish the fortune thine;
342: Grandam, I will not wish thy fortunes thrive:
343: Whoever wins, on that side shall I lose
344: Assured loss before the match be play'd.
345: LEWIS: Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.
346: BLANCH: There where my fortune lives, there my life dies.
347: KING JOHN: Cousin, go draw our puissance together.
348: France, I am burn'd up with inflaming wrath;
349: A rage whose heat hath this condition,
350: That nothing can allay, nothing but blood,
351: The blood, and dearest-valued blood, of France.
352: KING PHILIP: Thy rage sham burn thee up, and thou shalt turn
353: To ashes, ere our blood shall quench that fire:
354: Look to thyself, thou art in jeopardy.
355: KING JOHN: No more than he that threats. To arms let's hie!
ACT 3 SCENE 4

1: KING PHILIP: So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,
2: A whole armado of convicted sail
3: Is scatter'd and disjoin'd from fellowship.
4: CARDINAL PANDULPH: Courage and comfort! all shall yet go well.
5: KING PHILIP: What can go well, when we have run so ill?
6: Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?
7: Arthur ta'en prisoner? divers dear friends slain?
8: And bloody England into England gone,
9: O'erbearing interruption, spite of France?
10: LEWIS: What he hath won, that hath he fortified:
11: So hot a speed with such advice disposed,
12: Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,
13: Doth want example: who hath read or heard
14: Of any kindred action like to this?
15: KING PHILIP: Well could I bear that England had this praise,
16: So we could find some pattern of our shame.
17: Look, who comes here! a grave unto a soul;
18: Holding the eternal spirit against her will,
19: In the vile prison of afflicted breath.
20: I prithee, lady, go away with me.
21: CONSTANCE: Lo, now I now see the issue of your peace.
22: KING PHILIP: Patience, good lady! comfort, gentle Constance!
23: CONSTANCE: No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
24: But that which ends all counsel, true redress,
25: Death, death; O amiable lovely death!
26: Thou odouriferous stench! sound rottenness!
27: Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,
28: Thou hate and terror to prosperity,
29: And I will kiss thy detestable bones
30: And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
31: And ring these fingers with thy household worms
32: And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
33: And be a carrion monster like thyself:
34: Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smilest
35: And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,
36: O, come to me!
37: KING PHILIP: O fair affliction, peace!
38: CONSTANCE: No, no, I will not, having breath to cry:
39: O, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!
40: Then with a passion would I shake the world;
41: And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
42: Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice,
43: Which scorns a modern invocation.
44: CARDINAL PANDULPH: Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.
45: CONSTANCE: Thou art not holy to belie me so;
46: I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;
47: My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;
48: Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:
49: I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!
50: For then, 'tis like I should forget myself:
51: O, if I could, what grief should I forget!
52: Preach some philosophy to make me mad,
53: And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal;
54: For being not mad but sensible of grief,
55: My reasonable part produces reason
56: How I may be deliver'd of these woes,
57: And teaches me to kill or hang myself:
58: If I were mad, I should forget my son,
59: Or madly think a babe of clouts were he:
60: I am not mad; too well, too well I feel
61: The different plague of each calamity.
62: KING PHILIP: Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note
63: In the fair multitude of those her hairs!
64: Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen,
65: Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
66: Do glue themselves in sociable grief,
67: Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,
68: Sticking together in calamity.
69: CONSTANCE: To England, if you will.
70: KING PHILIP: Bind up your hairs.
71: CONSTANCE: Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?
72: I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
73: 'O that these hands could so redeem my son,
74: As they have given these hairs their liberty!'
75: But now I envy at their liberty,
76: And will again commit them to their bonds,
77: Because my poor child is a prisoner.
78: And, father cardinal, I have heard you say
79: That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:
80: If that be true, I shall see my boy again;
81: For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,
82: To him that did but yesterday suspire,
83: There was not such a gracious creature born.
84: But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud
85: And chase the native beauty from his cheek
86: And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
87: As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,
88: And so he'll die; and, rising so again,
89: When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
90: I shall not know him: therefore never, never
91: Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.
92: CARDINAL PANDULPH: You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
93: CONSTANCE: He talks to me that never had a son.
94: KING PHILIP: You are as fond of grief as of your child.
95: CONSTANCE: Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
96: Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,
97: Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,
98: Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
99: Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;
100: Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?
101: Fare you well: had you such a loss as I,
102: I could give better comfort than you do.
103: I will not keep this form upon my head,
104: When there is such disorder in my wit.
105: O Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!
106: My life, my joy, my food, my all the world!
107: My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' cure!
108: KING PHILIP: I fear some outrage, and I'll follow her.
109: LEWIS: There's nothing in this world can make me joy:
110: Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale
111: Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
112: And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste
113: That it yields nought but shame and bitterness.
114: CARDINAL PANDULPH: Before the curing of a strong disease,
115: Even in the instant of repair and health,
116: The fit is strongest; evils that take leave,
117: On their departure most of all show evil:
118: What have you lost by losing of this day?
119: LEWIS: All days of glory, joy and happiness.
120: CARDINAL PANDULPH: If you had won it, certainly you had.
121: No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,
122: She looks upon them with a threatening eye.
123: 'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
124: In this which he accounts so clearly won:
125: Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?
126: LEWIS: As heartily as he is glad he hath him.
127: CARDINAL PANDULPH: Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.
128: Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;
129: For even the breath of what I mean to speak
130: Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,
131: Out of the path which shall directly lead
132: Thy foot to England's throne; and therefore mark.
133: John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be
134: That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,
135: The misplaced John should entertain an hour,
136: One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
137: A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
138: Must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd;
139: And he that stands upon a slippery place
140: Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up:
141: That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall;
142: So be it, for it cannot be but so.
143: LEWIS: But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?
144: CARDINAL PANDULPH: You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,
145: May then make all the claim that Arthur did.
146: LEWIS: And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.
147: CARDINAL PANDULPH: How green you are and fresh in this old world!
148: John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;
149: For he that steeps his safety in true blood
150: Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.
151: This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts
152: Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,
153: That none so small advantage shall step forth
154: To cheque his reign, but they will cherish it;
155: No natural exhalation in the sky,
156: No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,
157: No common wind, no customed event,
158: But they will pluck away his natural cause
159: And call them meteors, prodigies and signs,
160: Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,
161: Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.
162: LEWIS: May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,
163: But hold himself safe in his prisonment.
164: CARDINAL PANDULPH: O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,
165: If that young Arthur be not gone already,
166: Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts
167: Of all his people shall revolt from him
168: And kiss the lips of unacquainted change
169: And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
170: Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.
171: Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:
172: And, O, what better matter breeds for you
173: Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge
174: Is now in England, ransacking the church,
175: Offending charity: if but a dozen French
176: Were there in arms, they would be as a call
177: To train ten thousand English to their side,
178: Or as a little snow, tumbled about,
179: Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,
180: Go with me to the king: 'tis wonderful
181: What may be wrought out of their discontent,
182: Now that their souls are topful of offence.
183: For England go: I will whet on the king.
ACT 4 SCENE 1

1: HUBERT: Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand
2: Within the arras: when I strike my foot
3: Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth,
4: And bind the boy which you shall find with me
5: Fast to the chair: be heedful: hence, and watch.
6: First Executioner: I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.
7: HUBERT: Uncleanly scruples! fear not you: look to't.
8: Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you.
9: ARTHUR: Good morrow, Hubert.
10: HUBERT: Good morrow, little prince.
11: ARTHUR: As little prince, having so great a title
12: To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.
13: HUBERT: Indeed, I have been merrier.
14: ARTHUR: Mercy on me!
15: Methinks no body should be sad but I:
16: Yet, I remember, when I was in France,
17: Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,
18: Only for wantonness. By my christendom,
19: So I were out of prison and kept sheep,
20: I should be as merry as the day is long;
21: And so I would be here, but that I doubt
22: My uncle practises more harm to me:
23: He is afraid of me and I of him:
24: Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?
25: No, indeed, is't not; and I would to heaven
26: I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.
27: HUBERT: [Aside] If I talk to him, with his innocent prate
28: He will awake my mercy which lies dead:
29: Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.
30: ARTHUR: Are you sick, Hubert? you look pale to-day:
31: In sooth, I would you were a little sick,
32: That I might sit all night and watch with you:
33: I warrant I love you more than you do me.
34: HUBERT: [Aside] His words do take possession of my bosom.
35: Read here, young Arthur.
36: How now, foolish rheum!
37: Turning dispiteous torture out of door!
38: I must be brief, lest resolution drop
39: Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.
40: Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?
41: ARTHUR: Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect:
42: Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?
43: HUBERT: Young boy, I must.
44: ARTHUR: And will you?
45: HUBERT: And I will.
46: ARTHUR: Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,
47: I knit my handercher about your brows,
48: The best I had, a princess wrought it me,
49: And I did never ask it you again;
50: And with my hand at midnight held your head,
51: And like the watchful minutes to the hour,
52: Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,
53: Saying, 'What lack you?' and 'Where lies your grief?'
54: Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'
55: Many a poor man's son would have lien still
56: And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;
57: But you at your sick service had a prince.
58: Nay, you may think my love was crafty love
59: And call it cunning: do, an if you will:
60: If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,
61: Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?
62: These eyes that never did nor never shall
63: So much as frown on you.
64: HUBERT: I have sworn to do it;
65: And with hot irons must I burn them out.
66: ARTHUR: Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!
67: The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,
68: Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears
69: And quench his fiery indignation
70: Even in the matter of mine innocence;
71: Nay, after that, consume away in rust
72: But for containing fire to harm mine eye.
73: Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?
74: An if an angel should have come to me
75: And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,
76: I would not have believed him,--no tongue but Hubert's.
77: HUBERT: Come forth.
78: Do as I bid you do.
79: ARTHUR: O, save me, Hubert, save me! my eyes are out
80: Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.
81: HUBERT: Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.
82: ARTHUR: Alas, what need you be so boisterous-rough?
83: I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.
84: For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!
85: Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,
86: And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;
87: I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,
88: Nor look upon the iron angerly:
89: Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,
90: Whatever torment you do put me to.
91: HUBERT: Go, stand within; let me alone with him.
92: First Executioner: I am best pleased to be from such a deed.
93: ARTHUR: Alas, I then have chid away my friend!
94: He hath a stern look, but a gentle heart:
95: Let him come back, that his compassion may
96: Give life to yours.
97: HUBERT: Come, boy, prepare yourself.
98: ARTHUR: Is there no remedy?
99: HUBERT: None, but to lose your eyes.
100: ARTHUR: O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,
101: A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
102: Any annoyance in that precious sense!
103: Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,
104: Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.
105: HUBERT: Is this your promise? go to, hold your tongue.
106: ARTHUR: Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues
107: Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:
108: Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert;
109: Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,
110: So I may keep mine eyes: O, spare mine eyes.
111: Though to no use but still to look on you!
112: Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold
113: And would not harm me.
114: HUBERT: I can heat it, boy.
115: ARTHUR: No, in good sooth: the fire is dead with grief,
116: Being create for comfort, to be used
117: In undeserved extremes: see else yourself;
118: There is no malice in this burning coal;
119: The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out
120: And strew'd repentent ashes on his head.
121: HUBERT: But with my breath I can revive it, boy.
122: ARTHUR: An if you do, you will but make it blush
123: And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert:
124: Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;
125: And like a dog that is compell'd to fight,
126: Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.
127: All things that you should use to do me wrong
128: Deny their office: only you do lack
129: That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,
130: Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.
131: HUBERT: Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye
132: For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:
133: Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,
134: With this same very iron to burn them out.
135: ARTHUR: O, now you look like Hubert! all this while
136: You were disguised.
137: HUBERT: Peace; no more. Adieu.
138: Your uncle must not know but you are dead;
139: I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports:
140: And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,
141: That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,
142: Will not offend thee.
143: ARTHUR: O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.
144: HUBERT: Silence; no more: go closely in with me:
145: Much danger do I undergo for thee.
ACT 4 SCENE 2

1: KING JOHN: Here once again we sit, once again crown'd,
2: And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.
3: PEMBROKE: This 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,
4: Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,
5: And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,
6: The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;
7: Fresh expectation troubled not the land
8: With any long'd-for change or better state.
9: SALISBURY: Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,
10: To guard a title that was rich before,
11: To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,
12: To throw a perfume on the violet,
13: To smooth the ice, or add another hue
14: Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light
15: To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,
16: Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.
17: PEMBROKE: But that your royal pleasure must be done,
18: This act is as an ancient tale new told,
19: And in the last repeating troublesome,
20: Being urged at a time unseasonable.
21: SALISBURY: In this the antique and well noted face
22: Of plain old form is much disfigured;
23: And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,
24: It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,
25: Startles and frights consideration,
26: Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,
27: For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.
28: PEMBROKE: When workmen strive to do better than well,
29: They do confound their skill in covetousness;
30: And oftentimes excusing of a fault
31: Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
32: As patches set upon a little breach
33: Discredit more in hiding of the fault
34: Than did the fault before it was so patch'd.
35: SALISBURY: To this effect, before you were new crown'd,
36: We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness
37: To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,
38: Since all and every part of what we would
39: Doth make a stand at what your highness will.
40: KING JOHN: Some reasons of this double coronation
41: I have possess'd you with and think them strong;
42: And more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,
43: I shall indue you with: meantime but ask
44: What you would have reform'd that is not well,
45: And well shall you perceive how willingly
46: I will both hear and grant you your requests.
47: PEMBROKE: Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,
48: To sound the purpose of all their hearts,
49: Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,
50: Your safety, for the which myself and them
51: Bend their best studies, heartily request
52: The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint
53: Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
54: To break into this dangerous argument,--
55: If what in rest you have in right you hold,
56: Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend
57: The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up
58: Your tender kinsman and to choke his days
59: With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
60: The rich advantage of good exercise?
61: That the time's enemies may not have this
62: To grace occasions, let it be our suit
63: That you have bid us ask his liberty;
64: Which for our goods we do no further ask
65: Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,
66: Counts it your weal he have his liberty.
67: KING JOHN: Let it be so: I do commit his youth
68: To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?
69: PEMBROKE: This is the man should do the bloody deed;
70: He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:
71: The image of a wicked heinous fault
72: Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
73: Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;
74: And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,
75: What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.
76: SALISBURY: The colour of the king doth come and go
77: Between his purpose and his conscience,
78: Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:
79: His passion is so ripe, it needs must break.
80: PEMBROKE: And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence
81: The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.
82: KING JOHN: We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:
83: Good lords, although my will to give is living,
84: The suit which you demand is gone and dead:
85: He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.
86: SALISBURY: Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
87: PEMBROKE: Indeed we heard how near his death he was
88: Before the child himself felt he was sick:
89: This must be answer'd either here or hence.
90: KING JOHN: Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
91: Think you I bear the shears of destiny?
92: Have I commandment on the pulse of life?
93: SALISBURY: It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame
94: That greatness should so grossly offer it:
95: So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.
96: PEMBROKE: Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,
97: And find the inheritance of this poor child,
98: His little kingdom of a forced grave.
99: That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,
100: Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!
101: This must not be thus borne: this will break out
102: To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.
103: KING JOHN: They burn in indignation. I repent:
104: There is no sure foundation set on blood,
105: No certain life achieved by others' death.
106: A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood
107: That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?
108: So foul a sky clears not without a storm:
109: Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?
110: Messenger: From France to England. Never such a power
111: For any foreign preparation
112: Was levied in the body of a land.
113: The copy of your speed is learn'd by them;
114: For when you should be told they do prepare,
115: The tidings come that they are all arrived.
116: KING JOHN: O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?
117: Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,
118: That such an army could be drawn in France,
119: And she not hear of it?
120: Messenger: My liege, her ear
121: Is stopp'd with dust; the first of April died
122: Your noble mother: and, as I hear, my lord,
123: The Lady Constance in a frenzy died
124: Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue
125: I idly heard; if true or false I know not.
126: KING JOHN: Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!
127: O, make a league with me, till I have pleased
128: My discontented peers! What! mother dead!
129: How wildly then walks my estate in France!
130: Under whose conduct came those powers of France
131: That thou for truth givest out are landed here?
132: Messenger: Under the Dauphin.
133: KING JOHN: Thou hast made me giddy
134: With these ill tidings.
135: Now, what says the world
136: To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff
137: My head with more ill news, for it is full.
138: BASTARD: But if you be afeard to hear the worst,
139: Then let the worst unheard fall on your bead.
140: KING JOHN: Bear with me cousin, for I was amazed
141: Under the tide: but now I breathe again
142: Aloft the flood, and can give audience
143: To any tongue, speak it of what it will.
144: BASTARD: How I have sped among the clergymen,
145: The sums I have collected shall express.
146: But as I travell'd hither through the land,
147: I find the people strangely fantasied;
148: Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,
149: Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:
150: And here a prophet, that I brought with me
151: From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found
152: With many hundreds treading on his heels;
153: To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,
154: That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,
155: Your highness should deliver up your crown.
156: KING JOHN: Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?
157: PETER: Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.
158: KING JOHN: Hubert, away with him; imprison him;
159: And on that day at noon whereon he says
160: I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang'd.
161: Deliver him to safety; and return,
162: For I must use thee.
163: O my gentle cousin,
164: Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?
165: BASTARD: The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it:
166: Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,
167: With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,
168: And others more, going to seek the grave
169: Of Arthur, who they say is kill'd to-night
170: On your suggestion.
171: KING JOHN: Gentle kinsman, go,
172: And thrust thyself into their companies:
173: I have a way to win their loves again;
174: Bring them before me.
175: BASTARD: I will seek them out.
176: KING JOHN: Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.
177: O, let me have no subject enemies,
178: When adverse foreigners affright my towns
179: With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!
180: Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,
181: And fly like thought from them to me again.
182: BASTARD: The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.
183: KING JOHN: Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.
184: Go after him; for he perhaps shall need
185: Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;
186: And be thou he.
187: Messenger: With all my heart, my liege.
188: KING JOHN: My mother dead!
189: HUBERT: My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;
190: Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about
191: The other four in wondrous motion.
192: KING JOHN: Five moons!
193: HUBERT: Old men and beldams in the streets
194: Do prophesy upon it dangerously:
195: Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:
196: And when they talk of him, they shake their heads
197: And whisper one another in the ear;
198: And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,
199: Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,
200: With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.
201: I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,
202: The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,
203: With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;
204: Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,
205: Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste
206: Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,
207: Told of a many thousand warlike French
208: That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:
209: Another lean unwash'd artificer
210: Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.
211: KING JOHN: Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
212: Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?
213: Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause
214: To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.
215: HUBERT: No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?
216: KING JOHN: It is the curse of kings to be attended
217: By slaves that take their humours for a warrant
218: To break within the bloody house of life,
219: And on the winking of authority
220: To understand a law, to know the meaning
221: Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns
222: More upon humour than advised respect.
223: HUBERT: Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
224: KING JOHN: O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
225: Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal
226: Witness against us to damnation!
227: How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
228: Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,
229: A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
230: Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,
231: This murder had not come into my mind:
232: But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,
233: Finding thee fit for bloody villany,
234: Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,
235: I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;
236: And thou, to be endeared to a king,
237: Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.
238: HUBERT: My lord--
239: KING JOHN: Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
240: When I spake darkly what I purposed,
241: Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,
242: As bid me tell my tale in express words,
243: Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,
244: And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:
245: But thou didst understand me by my signs
246: And didst in signs again parley with sin;
247: Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,
248: And consequently thy rude hand to act
249: The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.
250: Out of my sight, and never see me more!
251: My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,
252: Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:
253: Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
254: This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
255: Hostility and civil tumult reigns
256: Between my conscience and my cousin's death.
257: HUBERT: Arm you against your other enemies,
258: I'll make a peace between your soul and you.
259: Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine
260: Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,
261: Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
262: Within this bosom never enter'd yet
263: The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;
264: And you have slander'd nature in my form,
265: Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,
266: Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
267: Than to be butcher of an innocent child.
268: KING JOHN: Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,
269: Throw this report on their incensed rage,
270: And make them tame to their obedience!
271: Forgive the comment that my passion made
272: Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
273: And foul imaginary eyes of blood
274: Presented thee more hideous than thou art.
275: O, answer not, but to my closet bring
276: The angry lords with all expedient haste.
277: I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.
ACT 4 SCENE 3

1: ARTHUR: The wall is high, and yet will I leap down:
2: Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!
3: There's few or none do know me: if they did,
4: This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.
5: I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.
6: If I get down, and do not break my limbs,
7: I'll find a thousand shifts to get away:
8: As good to die and go, as die and stay.
9: O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones:
10: Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!
11: SALISBURY: Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury:
12: It is our safety, and we must embrace
13: This gentle offer of the perilous time.
14: PEMBROKE: Who brought that letter from the cardinal?
15: SALISBURY: The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,
16: Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love
17: Is much more general than these lines import.
18: BIGOT: To-morrow morning let us meet him then.
19: SALISBURY: Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be
20: Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.
21: BASTARD: Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!
22: The king by me requests your presence straight.
23: SALISBURY: The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:
24: We will not line his thin bestained cloak
25: With our pure honours, nor attend the foot
26: That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.
27: Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
28: BASTARD: Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.
29: SALISBURY: Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.
30: BASTARD: But there is little reason in your grief;
31: Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.
32: PEMBROKE: Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.
33: BASTARD: 'Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else.
34: SALISBURY: This is the prison. What is he lies here?
35: PEMBROKE: O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!
36: The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.
37: SALISBURY: Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
38: Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.
39: BIGOT: Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,
40: Found it too precious-princely for a grave.
41: SALISBURY: Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,
42: Or have you read or heard? or could you think?
43: Or do you almost think, although you see,
44: That you do see? could thought, without this object,
45: Form such another? This is the very top,
46: The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,
47: Of murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,
48: The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,
49: That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage
50: Presented to the tears of soft remorse.
51: PEMBROKE: All murders past do stand excused in this:
52: And this, so sole and so unmatchable,
53: Shall give a holiness, a purity,
54: To the yet unbegotten sin of times;
55: And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,
56: Exampled by this heinous spectacle.
57: BASTARD: It is a damned and a bloody work;
58: The graceless action of a heavy hand,
59: If that it be the work of any hand.
60: SALISBURY: If that it be the work of any hand!
61: We had a kind of light what would ensue:
62: It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;
63: The practise and the purpose of the king:
64: From whose obedience I forbid my soul,
65: Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,
66: And breathing to his breathless excellence
67: The incense of a vow, a holy vow,
68: Never to taste the pleasures of the world,
69: Never to be infected with delight,
70: Nor conversant with ease and idleness,
71: Till I have set a glory to this hand,
72: By giving it the worship of revenge.
73: BIGOT: Our souls religiously confirm thy words.
74: HUBERT: Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you:
75: Arthur doth live; the king hath sent for you.
76: SALISBURY: O, he is old and blushes not at death.
77: Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!
78: HUBERT: I am no villain.
79: SALISBURY: Must I rob the law?
80: BASTARD: Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.
81: SALISBURY: Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.
82: HUBERT: Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;
83: By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours:
84: I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,
85: Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;
86: Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget
87: Your worth, your greatness and nobility.
88: BIGOT: Out, dunghill! darest thou brave a nobleman?
89: HUBERT: Not for my life: but yet I dare defend
90: My innocent life against an emperor.
91: SALISBURY: Thou art a murderer.
92: HUBERT: Do not prove me so;
93: Yet I am none: whose tongue soe'er speaks false,
94: Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.
95: PEMBROKE: Cut him to pieces.
96: BASTARD: Keep the peace, I say.
97: SALISBURY: Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.
98: BASTARD: Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury:
99: If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,
100: Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,
101: I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;
102: Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,
103: That you shall think the devil is come from hell.
104: BIGOT: What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?
105: Second a villain and a murderer?
106: HUBERT: Lord Bigot, I am none.
107: BIGOT: Who kill'd this prince?
108: HUBERT: 'Tis not an hour since I left him well:
109: I honour'd him, I loved him, and will weep
110: My date of life out for his sweet life's loss.
111: SALISBURY: Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,
112: For villany is not without such rheum;
113: And he, long traded in it, makes it seem
114: Like rivers of remorse and innocency.
115: Away with me, all you whose souls abhor
116: The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;
117: For I am stifled with this smell of sin.
118: BIGOT: Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!
119: PEMBROKE: There tell the king he may inquire us out.
120: BASTARD: Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
121: Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
122: Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,
123: Art thou damn'd, Hubert.
124: HUBERT: Do but hear me, sir.
125: BASTARD: Ha! I'll tell thee what;
126: Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay, nothing is so black;
127: Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:
128: There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
129: As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.
130: HUBERT: Upon my soul--
131: BASTARD: If thou didst but consent
132: To this most cruel act, do but despair;
133: And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread
134: That ever spider twisted from her womb
135: Will serve to strangle thee, a rush will be a beam
136: To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,
137: Put but a little water in a spoon,
138: And it shall be as all the ocean,
139: Enough to stifle such a villain up.
140: I do suspect thee very grievously.
141: HUBERT: If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,
142: Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
143: Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,
144: Let hell want pains enough to torture me.
145: I left him well.
ACT 5 SCENE 1

1: KING JOHN: Thus have I yielded up into your hand
2: The circle of my glory.
3: CARDINAL PANDULPH: Take again
4: From this my hand, as holding of the pope
5: Your sovereign greatness and authority.
6: KING JOHN: Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,
7: And from his holiness use all your power
8: To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed.
9: Our discontented counties do revolt;
10: Our people quarrel with obedience,
11: Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
12: To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
13: This inundation of mistemper'd humour
14: Rests by you only to be qualified:
15: Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,
16: That present medicine must be minister'd,
17: Or overthrow incurable ensues.
18: CARDINAL PANDULPH: It was my breath that blew this tempest up,
19: Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;
20: But since you are a gentle convertite,
21: My tongue shall hush again this storm of war
22: And make fair weather in your blustering land.
23: On this Ascension-day, remember well,
24: Upon your oath of service to the pope,
25: Go I to make the French lay down their arms.
26: KING JOHN: Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
27: Say that before Ascension-day at noon
28: My crown I should give off? Even so I have:
29: I did suppose it should be on constraint:
30: But, heaven be thank'd, it is but voluntary.
31: BASTARD: All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out
32: But Dover castle: London hath received,
33: Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers:
34: Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone
35: To offer service to your enemy,
36: And wild amazement hurries up and down
37: The little number of your doubtful friends.
38: KING JOHN: Would not my lords return to me again,
39: After they heard young Arthur was alive?
40: BASTARD: They found him dead and cast into the streets,
41: An empty casket, where the jewel of life
42: By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away.
43: KING JOHN: That villain Hubert told me he did live.
44: BASTARD: So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.
45: But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?
46: Be great in act, as you have been in thought;
47: Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
48: Govern the motion of a kingly eye:
49: Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;
50: Threaten the threatener and outface the brow
51: Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,
52: That borrow their behaviors from the great,
53: Grow great by your example and put on
54: The dauntless spirit of resolution.
55: Away, and glister like the god of war,
56: When he intendeth to become the field:
57: Show boldness and aspiring confidence.
58: What, shall they seek the lion in his den,
59: And fright him there? and make him tremble there?
60: O, let it not be said: forage, and run
61: To meet displeasure farther from the doors,
62: And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.
63: KING JOHN: The legate of the pope hath been with me,
64: And I have made a happy peace with him;
65: And he hath promised to dismiss the powers
66: Led by the Dauphin.
67: BASTARD: O inglorious league!
68: Shall we, upon the footing of our land,
69: Send fair-play orders and make compromise,
70: Insinuation, parley and base truce
71: To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,
72: A cocker'd silken wanton, brave our fields,
73: And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,
74: Mocking the air with colours idly spread,
75: And find no cheque? Let us, my liege, to arms:
76: Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;
77: Or if he do, let it at least be said
78: They saw we had a purpose of defence.
79: KING JOHN: Have thou the ordering of this present time.
80: BASTARD: Away, then, with good courage! yet, I know,
81: Our party may well meet a prouder foe.
ACT 5 SCENE 2

1: LEWIS: My Lord Melun, let this be copied out,
2: And keep it safe for our remembrance:
3: Return the precedent to these lords again;
4: That, having our fair order written down,
5: Both they and we, perusing o'er these notes,
6: May know wherefore we took the sacrament
7: And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.
8: SALISBURY: Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
9: And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear
10: A voluntary zeal and an unurged faith
11: To your proceedings; yet believe me, prince,
12: I am not glad that such a sore of time
13: Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,
14: And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
15: By making many. O, it grieves my soul,
16: That I must draw this metal from my side
17: To be a widow-maker! O, and there
18: Where honourable rescue and defence
19: Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!
20: But such is the infection of the time,
21: That, for the health and physic of our right,
22: We cannot deal but with the very hand
23: Of stern injustice and confused wrong.
24: And is't not pity, O my grieved friends,
25: That we, the sons and children of this isle,
26: Were born to see so sad an hour as this;
27: Wherein we step after a stranger march
28: Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up
29: Her enemies' ranks,--I must withdraw and weep
30: Upon the spot of this enforced cause,--
31: To grace the gentry of a land remote,
32: And follow unacquainted colours here?
33: What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!
34: That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,
35: Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,
36: And grapple thee unto a pagan shore;
37: Where these two Christian armies might combine
38: The blood of malice in a vein of league,
39: And not to spend it so unneighbourly!
40: LEWIS: A noble temper dost thou show in this;
41: And great affections wrestling in thy bosom
42: Doth make an earthquake of nobility.
43: O, what a noble combat hast thou fought
44: Between compulsion and a brave respect!
45: Let me wipe off this honourable dew,
46: That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:
47: My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,
48: Being an ordinary inundation;
49: But this effusion of such manly drops,
50: This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,
51: Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amazed
52: Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
53: Figured quite o'er with burning meteors.
54: Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,
55: And with a great heart heave away the storm:
56: Commend these waters to those baby eyes
57: That never saw the giant world enraged;
58: Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
59: Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.
60: Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
61: Into the purse of rich prosperity
62: As Lewis himself: so, nobles, shall you all,
63: That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.
64: And even there, methinks, an angel spake:
65: Look, where the holy legate comes apace,
66: To give us warrant from the hand of heaven
67: And on our actions set the name of right
68: With holy breath.
69: CARDINAL PANDULPH: Hail, noble prince of France!
70: The next is this, King John hath reconciled
71: Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in,
72: That so stood out against the holy church,
73: The great metropolis and see of Rome:
74: Therefore thy threatening colours now wind up;
75: And tame the savage spirit of wild war,
76: That like a lion foster'd up at hand,
77: It may lie gently at the foot of peace,
78: And be no further harmful than in show.
79: LEWIS: Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back:
80: I am too high-born to be propertied,
81: To be a secondary at control,
82: Or useful serving-man and instrument,
83: To any sovereign state throughout the world.
84: Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
85: Between this chastised kingdom and myself,
86: And brought in matter that should feed this fire;
87: And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out
88: With that same weak wind which enkindled it.
89: You taught me how to know the face of right,
90: Acquainted me with interest to this land,
91: Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;
92: And come ye now to tell me John hath made
93: His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?
94: I, by the honour of my marriage-bed,
95: After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;
96: And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back
97: Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?
98: Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,
99: What men provided, what munition sent,
100: To underprop this action? Is't not I
101: That undergo this charge? who else but I,
102: And such as to my claim are liable,
103: Sweat in this business and maintain this war?
104: Have I not heard these islanders shout out
105: 'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?
106: Have I not here the best cards for the game,
107: To win this easy match play'd for a crown?
108: And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?
109: No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.
110: CARDINAL PANDULPH: You look but on the outside of this work.
111: LEWIS: Outside or inside, I will not return
112: Till my attempt so much be glorified
113: As to my ample hope was promised
114: Before I drew this gallant head of war,
115: And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world,
116: To outlook conquest and to win renown
117: Even in the jaws of danger and of death.
118: What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?
119: BASTARD: According to the fair play of the world,
120: Let me have audience; I am sent to speak:
121: My holy lord of Milan, from the king
122: I come, to learn how you have dealt for him;
123: And, as you answer, I do know the scope
124: And warrant limited unto my tongue.
125: CARDINAL PANDULPH: The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,
126: And will not temporize with my entreaties;
127: He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.
128: BASTARD: By all the blood that ever fury breathed,
129: The youth says well. Now hear our English king;
130: For thus his royalty doth speak in me.
131: He is prepared, and reason too he should:
132: This apish and unmannerly approach,
133: This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,
134: This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,
135: The king doth smile at; and is well prepared
136: To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,
137: From out the circle of his territories.
138: That hand which had the strength, even at your door,
139: To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,
140: To dive like buckets in concealed wells,
141: To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
142: To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,
143: To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out
144: In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake
145: Even at the crying of your nation's crow,
146: Thinking his voice an armed Englishman;
147: Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,
148: That in your chambers gave you chastisement?
149: No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
150: And like an eagle o'er his aery towers,
151: To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.
152: And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,
153: You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
154: Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;
155: For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids
156: Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
157: Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,
158: Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts
159: To fierce and bloody inclination.
160: LEWIS: There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;
161: We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well;
162: We hold our time too precious to be spent
163: With such a brabbler.
164: CARDINAL PANDULPH: Give me leave to speak.
165: BASTARD: No, I will speak.
166: LEWIS: We will attend to neither.
167: Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war
168: Plead for our interest and our being here.
169: BASTARD: Indeed your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
170: And so shall you, being beaten: do but start
171: An echo with the clamour of thy drum,
172: And even at hand a drum is ready braced
173: That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;
174: Sound but another, and another shall
175: As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
176: And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,
177: Not trusting to this halting legate here,
178: Whom he hath used rather for sport than need
179: Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits
180: A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
181: To feast upon whole thousands of the French.
182: LEWIS: Strike up our drums, to find this danger out.
183: BASTARD: And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.
ACT 5 SCENE 3

1: KING JOHN: How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.
2: HUBERT: Badly, I fear. How fares your majesty?
3: KING JOHN: This fever, that hath troubled me so long,
4: Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
5: Messenger: My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,
6: Desires your majesty to leave the field
7: And send him word by me which way you go.
8: KING JOHN: Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.
9: Messenger: Be of good comfort; for the great supply
10: That was expected by the Dauphin here,
11: Are wreck'd three nights ago on Goodwin Sands.
12: This news was brought to Richard but even now:
13: The French fight coldly, and retire themselves.
14: KING JOHN: Ay me! this tyrant fever burns me up,
15: And will not let me welcome this good news.
16: Set on toward Swinstead: to my litter straight;
17: Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.
ACT 5 SCENE 4

1: SALISBURY: I did not think the king so stored with friends.
2: PEMBROKE: Up once again; put spirit in the French:
3: If they miscarry, we miscarry too.
4: SALISBURY: That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,
5: In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.
6: PEMBROKE: They say King John sore sick hath left the field.
7: MELUN: Lead me to the revolts of England here.
8: SALISBURY: When we were happy we had other names.
9: PEMBROKE: It is the Count Melun.
10: SALISBURY: Wounded to death.
11: MELUN: Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;
12: Unthread the rude eye of rebellion
13: And welcome home again discarded faith.
14: Seek out King John and fall before his feet;
15: For if the French be lords of this loud day,
16: He means to recompense the pains you take
17: By cutting off your heads: thus hath he sworn
18: And I with him, and many moe with me,
19: Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;
20: Even on that altar where we swore to you
21: Dear amity and everlasting love.
22: SALISBURY: May this be possible? may this be true?
23: MELUN: Have I not hideous death within my view,
24: Retaining but a quantity of life,
25: Which bleeds away, even as a form of wax
26: Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?
27: What in the world should make me now deceive,
28: Since I must lose the use of all deceit?
29: Why should I then be false, since it is true
30: That I must die here and live hence by truth?
31: I say again, if Lewis do win the day,
32: He is forsworn, if e'er those eyes of yours
33: Behold another day break in the east:
34: But even this night, whose black contagious breath
35: Already smokes about the burning crest
36: Of the old, feeble and day-wearied sun,
37: Even this ill night, your breathing shall expire,
38: Paying the fine of rated treachery
39: Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,
40: If Lewis by your assistance win the day.
41: Commend me to one Hubert with your king:
42: The love of him, and this respect besides,
43: For that my grandsire was an Englishman,
44: Awakes my conscience to confess all this.
45: In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence
46: From forth the noise and rumour of the field,
47: Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
48: In peace, and part this body and my soul
49: With contemplation and devout desires.
50: SALISBURY: We do believe thee: and beshrew my soul
51: But I do love the favour and the form
52: Of this most fair occasion, by the which
53: We will untread the steps of damned flight,
54: And like a bated and retired flood,
55: Leaving our rankness and irregular course,
56: Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd
57: And cabby run on in obedience
58: Even to our ocean, to our great King John.
59: My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;
60: For I do see the cruel pangs of death
61: Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
62: And happy newness, that intends old right.
ACT 5 SCENE 5

1: LEWIS: The sun of heaven methought was loath to set,
2: But stay'd and made the western welkin blush,
3: When English measure backward their own ground
4: In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,
5: When with a volley of our needless shot,
6: After such bloody toil, we bid good night;
7: And wound our tattering colours clearly up,
8: Last in the field, and almost lords of it!
9: Messenger: Where is my prince, the Dauphin?
10: LEWIS: Here: what news?
11: Messenger: The Count Melun is slain; the English lords
12: By his persuasion are again fall'n off,
13: And your supply, which you have wish'd so long,
14: Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.
15: LEWIS: Ah, foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart!
16: I did not think to be so sad to-night
17: As this hath made me. Who was he that said
18: King John did fly an hour or two before
19: The stumbling night did part our weary powers?
20: Messenger: Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.
21: LEWIS: Well; keep good quarter and good care to-night:
22: The day shall not be up so soon as I,
23: To try the fair adventure of to-morrow.
ACT 5 SCENE 6

1: HUBERT: Who's there? speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.
2: BASTARD: A friend. What art thou?
3: HUBERT: Of the part of England.
4: BASTARD: Whither dost thou go?
5: HUBERT: What's that to thee? why may not I demand
6: Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?
7: BASTARD: Hubert, I think?
8: HUBERT: Thou hast a perfect thought:
9: I will upon all hazards well believe
10: Thou art my friend, that know'st my tongue so well.
11: Who art thou?
12: BASTARD: Who thou wilt: and if thou please,
13: Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
14: I come one way of the Plantagenets.
15: HUBERT: Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
16: Have done me shame: brave soldier, pardon me,
17: That any accent breaking from thy tongue
18: Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.
19: BASTARD: Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?
20: HUBERT: Why, here walk I in the black brow of night,
21: To find you out.
22: BASTARD: Brief, then; and what's the news?
23: HUBERT: O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,
24: Black, fearful, comfortless and horrible.
25: BASTARD: Show me the very wound of this ill news:
26: I am no woman, I'll not swoon at it.
27: HUBERT: The king, I fear, is poison'd by a monk:
28: I left him almost speechless; and broke out
29: To acquaint you with this evil, that you might
30: The better arm you to the sudden time,
31: Than if you had at leisure known of this.
32: BASTARD: How did he take it? who did taste to him?
33: HUBERT: A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,
34: Whose bowels suddenly burst out: the king
35: Yet speaks and peradventure may recover.
36: BASTARD: Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?
37: HUBERT: Why, know you not? the lords are all come back,
38: And brought Prince Henry in their company;
39: At whose request the king hath pardon'd them,
40: And they are all about his majesty.
41: BASTARD: Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
42: And tempt us not to bear above our power!
43: I'll tell tree, Hubert, half my power this night,
44: Passing these flats, are taken by the tide;
45: These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;
46: Myself, well mounted, hardly have escaped.
47: Away before: conduct me to the king;
48: I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.
ACT 5 SCENE 7

1: PRINCE HENRY: It is too late: the life of all his blood
2: Is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain,
3: Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,
4: Doth by the idle comments that it makes
5: Foretell the ending of mortality.
6: PEMBROKE: His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief
7: That, being brought into the open air,
8: It would allay the burning quality
9: Of that fell poison which assaileth him.
10: PRINCE HENRY: Let him be brought into the orchard here.
11: Doth he still rage?
12: PEMBROKE: He is more patient
13: Than when you left him; even now he sung.
14: PRINCE HENRY: O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes
15: In their continuance will not feel themselves.
16: Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
17: Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now
18: Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds
19: With many legions of strange fantasies,
20: Whi ch, in their throng and press to that last hold,
21: Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death
22: should sing.
23: I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,
24: Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,
25: And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
26: His soul and body to their lasting rest.
27: SALISBURY: Be of good comfort, prince; for you are born
28: To set a form upon that indigest
29: Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.
30: KING JOHN: Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;
31: It would not out at windows nor at doors.
32: There is so hot a summer in my bosom,
33: That all my bowels crumble up to dust:
34: I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen
35: Upon a parchment, and against this fire
36: Do I shrink up.
37: PRINCE HENRY: How fares your majesty?
38: KING JOHN: Poison'd,--ill fare--dead, forsook, cast off:
39: And none of you will bid the winter come
40: To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,
41: Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
42: Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
43: To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
44: And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,
45: I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait
46: And so ingrateful, you deny me that.
47: PRINCE HENRY: O that there were some virtue in my tears,
48: That might relieve you!
49: KING JOHN: The salt in them is hot.
50: Within me is a hell; and there the poison
51: Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize
52: On unreprievable condemned blood.
53: BASTARD: O, I am scalded with my violent motion,
54: And spleen of speed to see your majesty!
55: KING JOHN: O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye:
56: The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd,
57: And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
58: Are turned to one thread, one little hair:
59: My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,
60: Which holds but till thy news be uttered;
61: And then all this thou seest is but a clod
62: And module of confounded royalty.
63: BASTARD: The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,
64: Where heaven He knows how we shall answer him;
65: For in a night the best part of my power,
66: As I upon advantage did remove,
67: Were in the Washes all unwarily
68: Devoured by the unexpected flood.
69: SALISBURY: You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
70: My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus.
71: PRINCE HENRY: Even so must I run on, and even so stop.
72: What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,
73: When this was now a king, and now is clay?
74: BASTARD: Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind
75: To do the office for thee of revenge,
76: And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,
77: As it on earth hath been thy servant still.
78: Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
79: Where be your powers? show now your mended faiths,
80: And instantly return with me again,
81: To push destruction and perpetual shame
82: Out of the weak door of our fainting land.
83: Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;
84: The Dauphin rages at our very heels.
85: SALISBURY: It seems you know not, then, so much as we:
86: The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,
87: Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,
88: And brings from him such offers of our peace
89: As we with honour and respect may take,
90: With purpose presently to leave this war.
91: BASTARD: He will the rather do it when he sees
92: Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.
93: SALISBURY: Nay, it is in a manner done already;
94: For many carriages he hath dispatch'd
95: To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel
96: To the disposing of the cardinal:
97: With whom yourself, myself and other lords,
98: If you think meet, this afternoon will post
99: To consummate this business happily.
100: BASTARD: Let it be so: and you, my noble prince,
101: With other princes that may best be spared,
102: Shall wait upon your father's funeral.
103: PRINCE HENRY: At Worcester must his body be interr'd;
104: For so he will'd it.
105: BASTARD: Thither shall it then:
106: And happily may your sweet self put on
107: The lineal state and glory of the land!
108: To whom with all submission, on my knee
109: I do bequeath my faithful services
110: And true subjection everlastingly.
111: SALISBURY: And the like tender of our love we make,
112: To rest without a spot for evermore.
113: PRINCE HENRY: I have a kind soul that would give you thanks
114: And knows not how to do it but with tears.
