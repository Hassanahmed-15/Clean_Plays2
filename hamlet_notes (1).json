A brave man is never so peremptory as when he fears that he is afraid. Tschischwitz finds a 'psychological motive' in thus representing Bernardo as so forgetful of all military use and wont as to challenge Francisco who is on guard. Evidently Bernardo is afraid to meet the Ghost all alone, and it is because he feels so unmanned that his last words to Francisco are to bid Horatio and Marcellus make haste.

Tschischwitz: Marcellus is a firm believer in the Ghost, and the allusion to it as a “thing” betokening contempt and doubt can come only from the skeptic, Horatio. Hudson: There is a temperate skepticism well befitting a scholar in this speech of Horatio's. On the other hand, Elze advocates Marcellus.

This passage seems to contradict the critical law that what is told makes a faint impression compared with what is beholden; for it does indeed convey to the mind more than the eye can see; whilst the interruption of the narrative at the very moment when we are most intensely listening for the sequel, and have our thoughts diverted from the dreaded sight in expectation of the desired, yet almost dreaded, tale,—this gives all the suddenness and surprise of the original appearance."

        "German commentators have found more difficulty in this phrase than the English. Tieck supposes (and so translates) that the king 'dashed his sliding Pole axe on the ice.' 'Sledded,' he adds, 'according to a license frequent in Shakespeare, stands for \"sledding,\" which Tieck mistook for \"sliding.\"' The folly of this interpretation and its errors were exposed by Delius. But the spelling of the Qq sleaded, and the lack of a capital P in pollax, together with its Roman letters (proper names in the old copies being usually printed in Italics), still presented inexplicable difficulties. Friesen inclined to Tieck, believing it more 'conceivable that the king dashed down on the ice his sleaded battle-axe (whatever that might be) than that he struck an enemy or smote him to the ground, for in this case the king's visor would have been down, and Horatio could not have seen the frown on his face.' Wherefore, he concludes, there is greater likelihood of finding verbal obscurities in Shakespeare's text than downright nonsense. Elze and Delius follow the English commentators, and scout the idea of 'poleaxe.' The former follows Pope, on the ground that Polack is generally found in the singular, and refers to the Polish king, just as 'the Dane' is used in line 19 of this scene. Tschischwitz also follows Pope, because the plural Polacks would signify the whole Polish army, and it would be monstrous to suppose that the whole army could travel in sleighs; the 'sledded Polack' is therefore merely the Polish king, who, and who alone, had come to the conference on a sled. If the word 'Poleaxe' be adopted, insuperable difficulties attend the interpretation of 'sledded.' If it mean sledged, it refers to a battle-axe, to which a war-club (Old North German sleggja) has been added, and the words 'on the ice' are used instead of the more natural phrase on the ground to indicate that the parle took place on some frozen neutral river. Leo (Notes and Queries, November 19, 1864): 'I always regarded \"sleaded,\" or, as the modern editors read, \"sledded,\" as nonsense. What a ridiculous position it must have been to see a king, in full armour, smiting down a sledded man, i.e. a man sitting in a sledge! It would rather not have been a king-like action. And it was, of course, not a remarkable, not a memorable, fact, that in the cold Scandinavian country in winter-time, people were found sitting in a sledge; nobody would have wondered at it, — perhaps more at the contrary. When the king frowned in an angry parle he must have been provoked to it by an irritating behaviour of the adversary, and Horatio, remembering the fact, will also bear in mind the cause of it, and so, I suppose, he used an epithet which points out the provoking manner of the Polack; and, following as much as possible the form \"sleaded,\" I should like to propose the word sturdy, or, as it would have been written in Shakespeare's time, sturdy. Moltke believes that he has discovered the correct reading on aesthetic as well as philological grounds; Shakespeare wishes to portray to us the character of the deceased king, which must be full of grandeur and dignity. Such rage as Tieck's interpretation implies would be most unseemly; besides, by dashing down his poleaxe, he would disarm himself, which would be silly. The idea, therefore, conveyed by the word 'smite' must be personal to the king; it must be some gesture, not a blow delivered on an enemy. What, therefore, more natural than that he should strike his Poleaxe violently on the ice, just as any honest citizen is wont by-way of emphasis to strike his fist on the table? \"Sledded\" is a sophistication of the printers, and the correct text is his leaded poleaxe, i.e. his poleaxe loaded with lead; or his edged poleaxe, i.e. sharpened; or, for aught to the contrary, his sledged poleaxe. This emendation of Moltke's Clarendon pronounces an anticlimax; Shakespeare having mentioned \"Norway\" in the first clause would certainly have told us with whom the \"angry parle\" was held. Curiously enough, this emendation of Moltke's has been anticipated not by a German, but by an Englishman. In the Athenæum, 3d April, 1875, C. Eliot Browne gives some notes on Hamlet by the Earl of Rochester, 1761, and on the present passage is the following: 'Sleaded agrees with an axe, but not with a man; and signifies loaded with lead. ... The king was then in an angry parle (which can't signify fighting), and because he could not have his will most furiously struck his loaded or heavy battle-axe into the ice.' Johnson: 'Polack' is the name of an inhabitant of Poland. Polaque is French. As in Davison's translation of Passeratius's Epitaph on Henry III of France, published by Camden: 'This little stone a great king's heart doth hold, Who ruled the fickle French and Polacks bold.' Malone: The corrupted form in the Qq shows that Shakespeare wrote 'Polacks.' Since, as Dyce adds, the singular is afterwards spelled in this play 'Polacke,' 'Pollacke,' 'Poleak,' 'Pollock.' and 'Polake.' Steevens preferred the singular, because we cannot well suppose that in a parley the king belaboured many, as it is not likely that provocation was given by more than one, or that on such an occasion he would have condescended to strike a meaner person than a prince. Boswell: May not Poleax be put for the person who carried the pole-axe, a mark of rank, — as we should talk at the present day ' of the gold stick in waiting.' 'He sent a great and glorious duke, one of them that held the golden pole-axe, with his retinue,' etc.—Milton's Brief Hist, of Moscovia."

The term is taken from the French 'prest,' ready, and is so written in Henry VII's Book of Household Expenses. The word is here used in its ordinary signification, as shown by the Concordance. Lord Campbell (p. 103): Such confidence has there been in Shakespeare's accuracy, that this passage has been quoted both by text-writers and by judges on the bench as an authority upon the legality of the press-gang, and upon the debated question whether shipwrights, as well as common seamen, are liable to be pressed into the service of the royal navy.

Hoc esse signum praescii Norunt repromissae spei, Qua nos soporis liberi Speramus adventum Dei.” Douce quotes from another hymn, said to have been composed by Saint Ambrose, and formerly used in the Salisbury service: “It contains the following lines, which so much resemble the speech of Hor. that one might almost suppose Sh. to have seen them: ‘Preco diei jam sonat, Noctis profundae pervigil; Nocturna lux viantibus, A nocte noctem segregans.

        "Malone says Sh. should have written allows, and that many writers fall into this error, when a plural noun immediately precedes the verb. Steevens asserts that all such defects in Sh. were merely the errors of illiterate transcribers or printers. Caldecott boldly maintains that Sh. was fully justified, in cases like the present, by the usage of the best scholars and writers of the time, and gives instances from Queen Elizabeth's Seneca, and King James's Reylis and Cautelis of Scottis Poesie, from Puttenham's Arte of English Poesie, and Daniel's Apologie for Rytne; and, further, that this usage was proper because the ear abhors the cacophony of an accumulation of ss, more especially in poetry, whose province is to please the ear, not offend it. Knight says that the use of the plural verb with the nominative singular, a plural genitive intervening, can scarcely be detected as an error. 'The truth is, that it is only within the last half century that the construction of our language has attained that uniform precision which is now required. ... It is remarkable that the very commentators, who were always ready to fix the charge of ignorance of the rudiments of grammar upon Sh., have admitted the following passage in a note to 2 Hen. IV by that elegant modern scholar, T. Warton: \"Beaumont and Fletcher's play contains many satirical strokes against Heywood's comedy, the force of which are entirely lost to those who have not seen that comedy.\" ' Elze ingeniously suggests that 'allow' may be in the subjunctive, and Tschischwitz roundly asserts that it is, 'because it is preceded by the idea of comparison implied by \"than,\" which in Old English and Anglo-Saxon usually governed the subjunctive.' Abbott gives this as an instance of confusion of agreement by proximity (§ 412). For many instances (which Dyce with truth says might be multiplied without end) of apparent lack of agreement between the nominative and the verb, see Abbott, § 332 et seqq.; Macb. II, i, 61, and Ham. III, ii, 194; III, iii, 14."

In this instance, after having in the first scene made us take sides with Hamlet against the King, and after having still further fostered this feeling of sympathy for the one and dislike for the other by the King's hypocritical speech from the throne, it is of the utmost importance that this opposition between the two should be emphasized, and that Hamlet himself should be shown, not only as perfectly aware of it himself, but as equally determined that the King himself should be aware of it. All these objects fail if the speech be spoken aside.",
        "Hanmer: Probably a proverbial expression for a relationship so confused and blended that it was hard to define it. Johnson supposes 'kind' to be here the German word for child. That is, 'I am more than cousin and less than son.' This conjecture Steevens properly disposes of by requiring some proof that 'kind' was ever used by any English writer for child. He adds: A jingle of the same sort is found in Mother Bombie, 1594, '—the nearer we are in blood, the further we must be from love, the greater the kindred is, the less the kindness must be.' Again, in Gorboduc, 1561, 'In kinde a father, but not kindelynesse.' As 'kind,' however, signifies nature, Hamlet may mean that his relationship had become an unnatural one, as it was partly founded on incest. 'Kind' is used for nature in Jul. Ces., Ant. & Cleo., Rich. II, and Tit. And. So, too, we have 'kindness,' i.e. unnatural, in Ham. II, ii, 609. Malone gives substantially the best paraphrase: 'I am a little more than thy kinsman (for I am thy step-son), and am somewhat less than kind to thee (for I hate thee, as being the person who has incestuously married my mother).' Steevens says that it was the King who was 'less than kind;' so also does Caldecott, who somewhat darkly interprets (yet Moberly quotes it approvingly): More than a common relation, having a confusedly accumulated title of relationship, you have less than benevolent, or less than even natural, feeling; by a play upon 'kind' in its double use and double sense—its use as an adjective, signifying benevolent; and its sense as a substantive, signifying nature. We have 'unkind' in this sense in Ven. & Ad. 204. 'Surely,' says Knight, 'Hamlet applies these words to himself. The King has called him, \"My cousin Hamlet.\" He says, in a suppressed tone, \"A little more than kin,\"—a little more than cousin. The King adds, \"and my son.\" Hamlet says, \"less than kind;\"—I am little of the same nature with you.' Singer follows Steevens and Caldecott in applying these words to the King. 'By \"less than kind\" Hamlet means degenerate and base. \"Going out of kinde,\" (says Baret,) which goeth out of kinde, which doth, or worketh dishonour to his kindred. Degener: Forlignant.'—Alvearie, K. 59. \"Forligner\" says Cotgrave, \"to degenerate, or grow out of kind, to differ in conditions from his auncestors.\" That less than kind and out of kind have the same meaning who can doubt?' Collier aptly cites the following: 'I would he were not so near to us in kindred, then sure he would be nearer in kindness.'—Rowley, Search for Money, 1609, sig. B. (reprinted for the Percy Society). Elze calls attention to the fact that probably in no other work is the word 'kind' used so frequently and so unambiguously as in The Tragedie of Gorboduc. White and Hudson follow Steevens, Caldecott, and Singer in referring these words to the King. The former paraphrases: In marrying my mother, you have made yourself something more than my kinsman, and, at the same time, have shown yourself unworthy of our race, our kind. Coleridge: This playing on words may be attributed to many causes or motives; as, either to an exuberant activity of mind, as in the higher comedy of Sh. generally; or to an imitation of it as a mere fashion, as if it were said,—'Is not this better than groaning?'—or to a contemptuous exultation in minds vulgarized and overset by their success, as in the poetic instance of Milton's Devils in the battle; or it is the language of resentment, as is familiar to every one who has witnessed the quarrels of the lower orders, where is invariably a profusion of punning invective, whence, perhaps, nicknames have in a considerable degree sprung up: or it is the language of suppressed passion, and especially of a hardly-smothered personal dislike. The first and last of these combine in Hamlet's case; and I have little doubt that Farmer is right in supposing the equivocation carried on in the expression, 'too much i' the sun,' or son."

        "Johnson: A probable allusion to the proverb: 'Out of heaven's blessing into the warm sun.' Farmer suggested that a quibble was here intended between 'sun' and son. Caldecott: Adopting this suggestion of Farmer's, the passage must mean, 'I have too much about me of the character of expectancy, at the same time that I am torn prematurely from my sorrows, and thrown into the broad glare of the sun and day; have too much of the son and successor and public staging without possession of my rights, and without a due interval to assuage my grief.' But a closer observer, (continues Caldecott), here says: 'One part of Farmer's suggestion is right; Hamlet means that he had not possession of his rights; but there was no quibble; the allusion is to the proverb referred to by Johnson, which means, to be out of house and home,' or, at least, to be in a worse temporal condition than a man was, or should be. Thus in Lear, II, ii, 168, and '—they were brought from the good to the bad, and from Goddes blessyng (as the proverbe is) in to a warme sonne.'—Preface to Grindal's Profitable Doctrine, 1555. And again, 'By such art he thought to have removed him, as we say, out of God's blessing into the warm sun.'—Raleigh's Hist, of the World, 1677. His being deprived of his right, i.e. his succession to the kingdom, Hamlet might therefore call 'being too much i' the sun.' Knight: There is no quibble. His meaning is explained by the old proverb. Staunton: Hamlet may mean, 'I am too much in the way; a mote in the royal eye;' but his reply is purposely enigmatical. Dyce [Gloss, s. v. heaven's benediction, &c.): The proverbial expression alluded to by Johnson is found in various authors, from Heywood down to Swift; the former has, 'In your running from him to me, eye runne Out of God's blessing into the warmer Sunne.'—Dialogue on Proverbs, Workers, sig. G 2 ver. 1598; and the latter: 'Lord Sparkish. They say, marriages are made in heaven; but I doubt, when she was married, she had no friend there. Never out. Well, she's got out of God's blessing into the warm sun.'—Polite Conversation, Dialogue I, Works, vol. ix, p. 423. Ray gives as its equivalent, Ab equis ad asinos.—Proverbs, p. 192, ed. 1768. Hudson inclines to Farmer's suggestion, and adds: 'Perhaps there is the further meaning implied, that he finds too much sunshine of jollity in the Court, considering what has lately happened.' In Much Ado, II, i, 331, Beatrice says of herself, 'I am sun-burned,' and this phrase Hunter (i. 250) ingeniously explains, and gives it a signification akin to the present passage. '\"To be in the sun,\" \"to be in the warm sun,\" \"to be sun-burned,\" were phrases,' says Hunter, 'not uncommon in the time of Sh., and for a century later, to express the state of being without family connections, destitute of the comforts of domestic life. There must have been some reason for this association of discomfort with what is generally considered comfort, at least among northern nations, and this reason is found in the old English version of the One Hundred and Twenty-first Psalm, in which occurs the passage, \"So that the sun shall not burn thee by day, nor the moon by night;\" and as this psalm, in the earlier Rituals of the Church, was used in the Churching of Women, it followed that the matron who was surrounded by her husband and children was one who had received the benediction that the sun should not burn her, while the unmarried woman, who had received no such benediction, came to be spoken of by those who allowed themselves to use such jocular expressions as one \"still left exposed to the burning of the sun,\" or, as Beatrice says, \"sun-burned.\" When the translation of the Scriptures was revised, in the reign of James I, the word \"smite\" was substituted in this verse for \"burn,\" probably on account of these ludicrous associations; and for the same reason, on the last revision of the Liturgy, this psalm was left out of the service altogether. In the first and original use of this phrase, then, it denoted the state of being unmarried; thus Beatrice uses it. It then expanded so as to include the state of those who were without family connections of any kind; thus Hamlet uses it. It expanded still wider and included the state of those who have no home, and thus it is used in Lear, II, ii, 168. And it seems to have expanded wider still, and to have been sometimes used for any species of destitution, or distress, or evil. Hamlet therefore means, \"I have lost father and mother; you heap upon me the terms 'cousin' and 'son,' but I find myself forlorn, with none of the comforts remaining which arise out of the charities of kindred.\"' Ingenious as this explanation of Hunter's is, it applies with more force to the phrase used by Beatrice than to that used by Hamlet; we have no examples given us that 'to be in the sun' was ever thus understood, and for it we must take Hunter's unsupported assertion. Nicholson (N. & Q. 25 May, 1867) thus paraphrases: Ham. turns off the King's query with an apparently courtly compliment,—Nay, my lord, I am too much in the sunshine of your favour, where I show but as a shadow (too much am I in that sunshine which I detest); deposed by you as heir and successor to the throne on which by God's providence I was placed, I am now gone to the world; instead of being in clouds and rain, amid sorrow and tears for my dead father and king, I find myself in the midst of marriage festivities and carousings. Moberly thinks the proverb may have meant that a person loses all special advantages, and is reduced to light and sunshine, which are the common inheritance of all."

Read, therefore, 'with't no less nobility,' &c. Hanmer adopted this suggestion. Johnson says 'impart' is impart myself, communicate whatever I can bestow; and Heath and Capell both approve of this interpretation. Mason (p. 374): 'To impart toward' a person is not English. Moreover 'impart' is never neuter. Read, therefore, 'and still no less nobility of love' instead of 'with no less,' &c.; or else read 'Do I my part toward you' instead of 'do I impart.' Delius suggests that Sh. probably regarded 'no less nobility of love' as the object of 'impart,' and forgot, owing to the intermediate clause, that he had written 'with no less.' Badham (Cambridge Essays, 1856, p. 272) believes all difficulties removed by a slight transposition, thus: 'And with nobility no less of love,' &c. The nobility that he grants him is that of heir-presumptive. Dyce pronounces this reading of Badham's 'very improper.' What would he have said had he seen Tschischwitz's reading, which substitutes 'wu' for 'with,' that is, I wis (as in Mer. of Ven. II, ix, 68, for the old 'y-wiss'), meaning assuredly? Keightley would read, 'Mine do I impart toward you,' &c."

        "Steevens having said that the crown of Denmark was elective, Blackstone (in a note which is not given among the other notes by him in vol. xii of the Sh. Soc.) agrees with him, adding: Though it must be customary, in elections, to pay some attention to the royal blood, which by degrees produced hereditary succession. Why, then, do the rest of the commentators so often treat Claudius as an usurper, who had deprived young Hamlet of his right by heirship to his father's crown? Hamlet calls him drunkard, murderer, and villain; one who had carried the election by low and mean practices; had 'Popp'd in between the election and my hopes—;' had 'From a shelf the precious diadem stole, And put it in his pocket;' but never hints at his being an usurper. His discontent arose from his uncle's being preferred before him, not from any legal right which he pretended to set up to the crown. Some regard was probably had to the recommendation of the preceding prince in electing the successor. And therefore young Hamlet had 'the voice of the king himself for his succession in Denmark;' and he at his own death prophesies that 'the election would light on Fortinbras, who had his dying voice,' conceiving that by the death of his uncle he himself had been king for an instant, and had therefore a right to recommend. When, in the fourth Act, the rabble wished to choose Laertes king, I understand that antiquity was forgot, and custom violated, by electing a new king in the lifetime of the old one, and perhaps also by the calling in a stranger to the royal blood. Elze: It is not exactly consistent with this elective character that the queen should be called 'the imperial jointress of this warlike state.' Marshall (p. 16): Perhaps the comparative youth of Ham., and the fact that the kingdom was threatened by the Norwegians, were the reasons which induced the royal councillors to place the sceptre in the hands of Claudius."

        "Nares pointed out the intensive effect of this reduplication, giving instances from Holinshed and Spenser, and adding that it is common. Halliwell (Sh. Soc. Papers, 1844, i, 39) showed that 'too-too' is a provincial word recognized by Ray, and explained by him as meaning 'very well or good,' and that Watson a few years afterwards says it is 'often used to denote exceeding.' In proof 'that too-too, as used by our early writers, is one word, denoting \"exceedingly\" and that it ought to be so printed,' Halliwell gives from the poets twelve instances, from Skelton down to Hudibras, and refers to over thirty other passages where the phrase is found, extending from Promos and Cassandra to Young's Night Thoughts. [After all, Halliwell did not so print it in his edition.] Hunter doubts if this reduplication be emphatic. It appears to him to have been in sense neither more nor less than too, and he cites many instances from prose writers. Palsgrave, he adds, has beside to-much, to-little, &c, to to much, to to great, to to little, to to small, answering to par trop trop peu, par trop trop grant, par trop trop petit. The pronunciation was too-to6, as appears by this line of Constable's: 'But I did too-too inestimable wey her.' That the phrase was used with intensifying iteration, White thinks is clear from instances like the present, and from the similar iteration of other adverbs and adjectives in the literature of Shakespeare's day. For instance: 'Thy wit dost use still still more harmes to finde,'—Sidney's Arcadia, ii, p. 225, ed. 1603; 'While he did live far far was, all disorder,—lb. v, p. 430; 'your lesson is Far far too long to learne iw without bocke,'—Astrophel and Stella, St. 56, lb. p. 537; 'Stop you my mouth with still still kissing me,'—lb. St. 81, lb. p. 547; 'Even to thy pure and most most loving breast,'—Sh. Son. no. In any case the compound epithet must have originated in the frequent iterative use of the word. Staunton thinks that the present instance must be regarded as an exception to Halliwell's rule. Here the repetition of too is not only strikingly beautiful, rhetorically, but it admirably expresses that morbid condition of the mind which makes the unhappy prince deem all the uses of the world but 'weary, stale, flat and unprofitable.' Halliwell notes that his copy of F1 reads 'too- too,' with the hyphen. 131-161: Coleridge: This tcedium vita is a common oppression on minds cast in the Hamlet mould, and is caused by disproportionate mental exertion, which necessitates exhaustion of bodily feeling. Where there is a just coincidence of external and internal action, pleasure is always the result; but where the former is deficient, and the mind's appetency of the ideal is unchecked, realities will seem cold and unmoving. In such cases passion combines itself with the indefinite alone. In this mood of his mind the relation of the appearance of his father's spirit in arms is made all at once to Hamlet: it is—Horatio's speech, in particular—a perfect model of the true style of dramatic narrative; the purest poetry, and yet in the most natural language, equally remote from the inkhorn and the plough.",
        "Moberly: The base affinities of our nature are ever present to Hamlet's mind. Here he thinks of the body as hiding from us the freshness, life, and nobleness of God's creation. If it were to pass away, silently and spontaneously, like the mist on a mountain-side, or if, curtain-like, we might tear it down by an act of violence, it may be that we should see quite another prospect; at any rate, the vile things now before us would be gone for ever."

Gifford (note on Massinger's Unnatural Combat, Works, vol. i, p. 148, ed. 1813): It is very difficult to determine the precise meaning which our ancestors gave to discourse, or to distinguish the line which separated it from reason. Perhaps it indicated a more rapid deduction of consequences from premises than was supposed to be effected by reason;—but I speak with hesitation.... Whatever be the sense, it frequently appears in our old writers, by whom it is usually coupled with reason or judgement, which last would seem to be the more proper word.... 'Discourse of reason' is so poor and perplexed a phrase, that [in Ham. I, ii, 150] I should dismiss it at once for what I believe to be the genuine reading: 'discourse and reason.' Boswell: The text may be supported by numerous examples. The very same phrase is used in Tro. & Cress. II, ii, 116. In the preface to Davys's Reports: 'And this idea I have conceived of him, not out of mine own imagination, or weak discourse of reason;' and Saville's Tacitus's Agricola, 1591, p. 242: 'Agricola, though brought up in the field, upon a naturall wit, and discourse of reason,' cap. ix. Hamlet himself explains the phrase in IV, iv, 36. Caldecott adds, Oth. IV, ii, 153, 'discourse of thought.' Singer (ed. 2): 'Discourse of reason' means ratiocination. Brutes have not this reasoning faculty, though they have what is instinct and memory. Hamlet opposes the discursive power of the intellect of men to the instinct of brutes. Dyce (Gloss.) cites: 'There was no discourse of reason strong enough to divert him from thinking that he was betrayed.'—A Tragi- comicall History of our Times, &c, p. 34, 1627."

Tooke derived its two opposite meanings from the single Anglo-Saxon word derian, to hurt, thence deriving our word dear = not cheap (when the season dereth the crops, causing a dearth); hence what is not cheap is precious, valued; whence comes the secondary meaning of dear = beloved. In this passage 'dearest' has reverted to its original meaning of hurtful, mischievous. This plausible derivation, or rather explanation, of the two distinct and contrary meanings of the word has been followed by Richardson in his Dictionary, and by the edd. above named, except Craik, who detected Tooke's error in tracing the word, in both its meanings, to one root, by showing that the word dear = high-priced, precious, beloved, is the Anglo-Saxon deore, dure, dyre, from the verb deoran or dyran, to hold dear, to love. Craik thus explains the different senses which the word assumes: the notion properly involved in it of love having first become generalized into that of a strong affection of any kind, thence passes on into that of such an emotion the very reverse of love, or as Clarendon concisely states it: 'dear' is used of whatever touches us nearly either in love or hate, joy or sorrow."

Capell (i, 124): 'This observation' of Warburton's 'is not ill-grounded; for the moment he's at the end of his lesson, we are regal'd with a style very different, and flowers of speech is his way.' Caldecott: These golden precepts very ill accord with the character and intellect imputed to Polonius in the rest of the play, where he appears to be what Hamlet calls him, a 'tedious old fool,' a 'wretched rash fool,' 'a foolish prating knave.' Knight adds: 'It is remarkable that in Q1 the \"precepts\" are printed with inverted commas, as if they were taken from some known source; or, at any rate, as if Polonius had delivered them by an effort of memory alone.' Dyce [Remarks, etc. p. 207): Not at all 'remarkable.' In the Qq (except Q1), a speech of the Queen, IV, v, 17-20, is 'printed with inverted commas.' In various other early plays the Gnomic portions are so distinguished [Dyce here cites many examples from early poetry of thus marking maxims; he might have descended to much later times. Warburton, in his edition of Sh., uniformly keeps the custom. Ed.]. Hunter (ii, 219): Polonius is the dull, prosing politician of the time. There is probably much personal satire in the character. It was the practice of those politicians to deliver maxims to their children, to be their guide in life. Thus Lord Burghley left ten admirable precepts of worldly prudence to his son Robert, afterwards Earl of Salisbury, which may be read in the Desiderata Curiosa; and in The Harleian Miscellany is a letter from Sir Henry Sydney to Philip his son, containing divers lessons of prudence delivered in a didactic form. That there was some individual nobleman more particularly pointed at in the character of Polonius I can entertain no doubt, nor that some attentive observer of the men of those times will one day trace the Poet home. Could it be the Lord Chamberlain? Prynne alludes to the practice of bringing living noblemen upon the stage, and names particularly the Lord Admiral, the Lord Treasurer, and Count Gondomer. as persons with whom the stage had made free. Rushton [Shakespeare's Euphuism, p. 46): The advice of Euphues to Philautus is probably the origin of these few precepts of Polonius. For line 59, see Euphues: — 'Be not lavish of thy tongue.' Lines 64, 65, thus Euphues: — 'Eveiy one that shaketh thee by the hand, is not joined to thee in heart.' Lines 66, 67, Euphues: — 'Be not quarrellous for every light occasion: they never fight without provoking, and once provoked they never cease.'

Ritson (Remarks, etc. p. 193): The nobility of France are select and generous above all other nations, and chiefly in the point of apparel; the richness and elegance of their dress. Malone: May we suppose that 'chief' of the Ff is a word borrowed from heraldry? They in France approve themselves to be of a most select and generous escutcheon by their dress. Chef, in heraldry, is the upper third part of the shield. See Minsheu. This is very harsh; yet I hardly think that the words 'of a' could have been introduced without some authority from the MS. 'Generous' = generosus. 'Chief,' however, may have been used as a substantive, for note or estimation. Knight : It is scarcely necessary to go to heraldry for an explanation of the word : we have it in composition, as in mischief and the now obsolete bonchief. ' Chief,' literally the head, here signifies eminence, supe- riority. Those of the best rank and station are of a most select and generous superiority in the indication of their dignity by their apparel. Collier (ed. 1) : The meaning perhaps is : ' Are of a most select and generous rank and station, chiefly in that.' Dyce, in his Remarks, &c. p. 206, while approving of Collier's rendering of ' chief in that' (' the words can be used here in no other sense ' than chiefly in that), objects to the violent ellipsis which is implied by inserting 'rank and station ' after • select and generous,' and adds : ' During the many hours which I have spent (perhaps wasted) in collating early dramas, I have known four or five editions of a play, though differing from each other materially elsewhere, yet coincide in some one most erroneous reading (which was corrected by a fortunately extant MS) : the text of that particular place having been once vitiated, the corruption had been retained in all the subsequent impressions. Such is evidently the case here (where there is unluckily no MS Hamlet to refer to) ; and the probability seems to be, that the strangely impertinent words, \" of a,\" found their way into the line, while the eye of the transcriber or compositor, glancing away from it for a moment, was arrested by \" of the \" immediately above.' Collier (ed. ii) : « Choice' was formerly not unfrequently spelt choise, and the longy led to the misprinting of choice,' first, chiefe, and afterwards cheff. The (MS) substitutes ' choice,' and the whole difficulty is removed, for Polonius says that the French are * of a most select ind generous choice' in all matters relating to dress. White [see this line and the next above it in Q,, Appendix, p. 47. Ed.] : Here [in QJ I believe that we have not only the obvious misprint of ' gencrall ' for ' generous,' and the interpolation of ' of a,' which all editors have supposed, but the accidental repetition in the second line of ' chief in the first, — a kind of misprint which often occurs in the old texts of these plays. The two errors last named were perpetuated (as errors sometimes unaccountably are), although ' chief in the first line was changed to ' best.' This reading of White's the Cambridge Editors {Preface, viii) approve of as 'probably' what Sh. had * originally written ;' the corruption in Qx and Qa which, they say, is clearly due to an error in the transcript from which both were copied, may have arisen from Shakespeare's having « given between the lines, or in the margin, \" of,\" \"chief,\" meaning these as alternative readings for \"in\" and \"best\" in line 73. The transcriber by mistake inserted them in line 74.' Staunton : The slight change of sheaf for * chiefe ' or ' cheff,' a change for which we alone are answerable, seems to impart a better and more poetic meaning to the passage than any variation yet suggested; and it is supported, if not established, by the following extracts from Ben Jonson : ' Ay, and with assurance, That it is found in noblemen and gentlemen Of the best sheaf? — The Magnetic Lady, III, iv. ' I am so haunted at the ^ourt and at my lodging with your refined choice spirits, that it makes me clean of another garb, another sheaf? — Every Man Out of His Humour, II, i. INGLEBY [N."

        "Dyce: Festivity, a drinking-bout. See Macb. I, vii, 64.",
        "Four explanations have been proposed. First: Pope (followed by Hanmer) referred it to the King, and changed it into upstart; Johnson retained 'up-spring,' but adopted in a paraphrase Pope's emendation, 'a blustering upstart.' Nares adds the definition: 'one insolent from sudden elevation.' Singer also prefers this interpretation. Second: Steevens started the correct explanation when he showed by the following passage from Chapman's Alphonsus, that the 'up-spring' was a German dance: 'We Germans have no changes in our dances. An Almain and an upspring, that is all.' Elze confirmed it when, in his edition of Chapman's Alphonsus [p. 144], he showed that this 'up-spring' was 'the \"Hüpfauf,\" the last and consequently the wildest dance at the old German merry-makings. See Ayrer's Dramen, ed. by Keller, iv, 2840 and 2846: \"Ey, jtzt geht irst der hüpfTauff an. Ey, Herr, jtzt kummt erst der hüpfTauff.\" No epithet could therefore be more appropriate to this drunken dance than Shakespeare's \"swaggering.\" I need hardly add that \"up-spring\" is an almost literal translation of the German name. Staunton, while assuming that 'up-spring' refers to a dance, understands 'reels' as a plural noun, qualified by 'up-spring.' [I have always supposed it to be a verb, in the same construction as 'keeps.' Ed.] Third: Steevens, in his note on 'rouse,' having quoted from Decker's Guls Hornbook: 'Teach me, thou soveraigne skinker, how to take the German's upsy freeze, the Danish rousa,' &c., Caldecott inferred that the 'up-spring' dance might be like the 'upsy freeze,' both connected with the music and not of a German debauch. Bath [in Cambridge Essays, 1856, p. 283] went a step farther, and would substitute for 'up-spring' in the present line, upsy freeze. 'Not that I know,' he adds, 'what upsy freeze is, or whence it is derived,' but from Steevens's citation 'it is evident that it was a species of drinking.' 'Up-spring,' he says, 'cannot be a dance (as if the descendants of the Berserker would interpolate their serious drinking with such a frivolous thing as a dance!), nor can it mean upstart—that is, Hamlet's uncle (a likely epithet to be uttered before two persons, and that when he has not yet seen the Ghost, and has no other feeling towards his uncle but one of vague aversion!).' Fourth: Keightley (Expositor, p. 288) says that it is 'used collectively for the risers from the table, a mode of expression not yet obsolete.'"

Stats. 276. Hamlet, therefore, may speak of Denmark, or Elsinore as the manor, himself as nativus, to the manor born, and the 'heavy-headed revel' as a custom incident to the manor.

        "Dyce: Judgement, opinion. See I, iii, 69. 38–40: Theobald: The Tenour of this Speech is, that let men have never so many, or so eminent, Virtues, if they have one Defect which accompanies them, that single Blemish shall throw a Stain upon their whole Character, and not only so, but shall deface the very Essence of all their Goodness, to its own Scandal; so that their Virtues themselves will become their Reproach. I have ventured to conjecture: 'The dram of base Doth all the noble substance of worth out To his own scandal.' The dram of base, i.e. the least alloy of baseness or vice. Shakespeare frequently uses the adjective of quality instead of the substantive of the thing. Elsewhere speaking of worth, Shakespeare delights to consider it as a Quality that adds Weight to a person. See All's Well, III, iv, 31, and 'From whose so many weights of baseness cannot A dram of worth be drawn.' — Cym. III, v, 88. Heath: I should rather suspect Shakespeare might have written 'The dram of base Doth all the noble substance oft eat out,' &c. But granting a little farther departure from the printed text, I should think it still more probable that the true reading is: 'Doth all the noble substance soil with doubt.' That is: A dram of base alloy stains all the noble substance of his virtues with the suspicion that they are mere tinsel appearances only, and not of the true sterling standard. Capell [Notes, &c. i, 126), after citing Heath with approval, adds, 'But it should seem, from the comment that the same author makes upon his second amendment, that the line stands in need of a substantive, following \"of\" to perfect the sense of it. And this, in truth, is the light in which the editor has view'd the corruption all along; that some word was slipt out of the copy, and \"out\" changed to \"a doubt\" by the printer's ingeniousness: the vacancy cannot be fill'd better than by the word in possession; and the line may be cur'd of it's baldness by no very great licence, the change of \"all\" into eat; after which, the comment that has been given above [Heath's] is both a just and a perfect one.' [Which means that Capell would read the line 'Doth eat the noble substance of worth out? In Capell's list of 'Various Readings of Hamlet' he cites the reading of Q1 thus: of eale 40. a. (f. ill). This, I presume, indicates, what the Cam. Edd. ascribe to him, the conjecture of ill for 'eale.' Hereby Capell anticipated Jennens, who merely states that he ventures to read: 'The dram of ill Doth all the noble substance of good out, To,' &c. In the Var. of 1773, Steevens says: 'Mr Holt reads, The dram of base Doth all the noble substance oft adopt, &c. I would read Doth all the noble substance (i.e. the sum of good qualities) oft do out.' 'To do a thing out is to efface, or obliterate anything in drawing.' Perhaps we should say, 'To its own scandal.' [Vide infra, Steevens, 1793.] Davies [Dramatic Misc. 1784, iii, 10): The very trifling alteration of adding a letter to one word, and the changing two letters for one in another, will restore to us the original reading, 'The dram of base Doth all the noble substance oft work out,' &c. When I read this proposed emendation to the reverend and learned Mr Robertson, he not only concurred with me, but assured me he had himself made the same amendment. The apostle James hath a sentiment very similar to the present passage; 'For, whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.' [In the Var. 1785, S[tephen] W[eston] proposes the same emendation. Ed.] Mason (1785): I offer as an amendment (which is at least as near the old text as any yet proposed, and which is supported by line 35), 'Doth all the noble substance of 't corrupt.' Malone (1790): 'The dram of base Doth all the noble substance of worth dout, To,' &c. To dout signified in Shakespeare's time, and yet signifies in Devonshire and other western counties, to do out, to efface, to extinguish. Thus they say, 'dout the candle, dout the fire,' &c., just as don signifies do on [or doff, do off — Steevens]. 'Dout' having been written by the transcriber doubt, and the word 'worth' having been inadvertently omitted, probably the line, in the copy for the press, stood: Doth all the noble substance of doubt. The editor or printer of the Qq, finding the line too short, inserted the indefinite article, without attending to the context. Theobald's insertion of worth is fully justified by his citation from Cymbeline. [Malone, in Var. 1785, proposed 'By his own scandal;' but did not repeat it in his own edition. Ed.] Steevens [1793. Vide supra, Steevens, 1773]: I now think we should read: 'The dram of base Doth all the noble substance often dout,' &c., for surely it is needless to say—'the noble substance of worth dout,' because the idea of worth is comprehended in the epithet noble. N. B. This improvement I owed, about four years ago, to the late Rev. Henry Homer. Rann (1794?): 'Doth all, &c. oft corrupt: oft work out: eat out: By it's own scandal.' MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS (Explanations and Emendations of Some Passages in the Text of Shakespeare, Edinburgh, 1814): I suppose there was a shifting of types from the upper to the lower line, and read thus: 'The dram of doubt Doth all the noble substance oft anneal To,' &c. That is, the dram of doubtful or base metal doth often, in the operation of annealing, cause the whole substance to become durably as base as itself. Whether this emendation will be made out by a comparison with the processes used in the arts, I know not, as everything connected with chemical science, or any branch of philosophy, appeareth to me too insignificant to bestow upon it one moment's attention. Zachary Jackson says that he has endeavored to give the passage some sense, but cannot speak with that perfect confidence which he does in reference to 'most of my restorations.' Boswell (1821): A clear meaning is afforded by Holt's emendation, if we take 'substance' as a nominative: 'The noble substance doth oft bring disgrace upon itself by adopting the dram of base.' If this interpretation be rejected, I would prefer to suppose that doubt means to bring into doubt or suspicion, as to fear means to create fear; to pale is to make pale. Yet I prefer Holt's change. Caldecott merely enumerates, with approval, the various changes which preceding editors have made, and which he adopts. [See Text. Notes.] Singer (ed. i): 'The dram of bale Doth all the noble substance often doubt To,' &c. I see no reason why dout should be substituted for 'doubt.' Boswell's interpretation of 'doubt' is just. I have ventured to read bale (i.e. evil) as nearer to the reading of the first edition. Stearns (Sh. Treas. p. 373) adopted this reading of Singer's, and explains it as a reference to the commerce in drugs, in which a great deal of adulteration is practiced; for the word bale we have now only the word alloy. Collier: It is easy to see how 'ill' might be misprinted eale, and 'often dout' of a doubt; the compositor having taken the passage by his ear only: indeed, a stronger proof of the kind could hardly be pointed out. Delius: 'The dram of bale Doth all the noble substance off and out To,' &c. In the old editions 'off' is constantly used for of, just as doubt for dout. In MS andout, run into one word, would be readily mistaken for a doubt, especially if an abbreviation were used instead of and. The sense is: The dram of evil doth off [i.e. puts off] and doth out [i.e. puts out] all the noble substance,' &c. A. E. Br[ae] (N. & Qu. 21 Feb. 1852): Eafe and eale so nearly resemble each other, and the subsequent transition to bafe is so extremely obvious, and so consistent with the sense, that there can hardly be any plausible ground for the rejection of base in favour of ill. Moreover, base is the natural antagonist of 'noble' in the next line. Now, in what way does 'the dram (i.e. an indefinitely small quantity, as gram is used now-a-days) of base' affect 'all the noble substance'? Shakespeare says it renders it doubtful or suspicious. 'Doubt' in this place is not a verb, but a noun substantive. The chief hindrance now to a perfect meaning consists in the restriction of 'doth' to a mere expletive. Let this restriction be removed, by conferring upon 'doth' the value of an effective verb, and the difficulty disappears: thus, 'the base doth doubt to the noble,' i.e. imparts doubt to it, or renders it doubtful. We say a man's good actions do him credit; why not also, his bad ones do him doubt? There now remains 'of a' to be amended. I suggest offer; it is almost identical (in sound at least) with the original, and it materially assists in giving a much clearer application to the last line. For these reasons, but especially for the last, I adopt offer, as a verb in the infinitive ruled by 'doth,' in the sense of causing or compelling. Thus the meaning of the passage becomes 'The base doth the noble offer doubt to his own scandal,' that is, causes the noble to excite suspicion, to the injury of its own character. H. F. (N. & Qu. 6 March, 1852): Read 'dram of base...often dull To his,' &c., merely a substitution of letters. Periergus Bibliophilus (N. & Qu. 17 Aug. 1852): As the least deviation from the old copies, I prefer 'The dram of base Doth, all the noble substance o'er, a doubt, To his own scandal,' i.e. doth cast a doubt over all the noble substance, bring into suspect all the noble qualities by the leaven of one dram of baseness. Singer (ed. ii): Most probably Shakespeare wrote: Doth all the noble substance oft adoub.' Using the word adoubt for doubt in its active sense of to bring into doubt or suspicion. We have numerous old words of similar form, and in Latin dubito is written addubito by Cicero and others. It is evident that dout could not have been the word, for the meaning is 'The dram of base renders all the noble substance doubtful or suspicious,' not that it extinguishes it altogether. I read base as suggested by Q1, from its more direct opposition to noble. [Singer's text follows Q2Q3, except that base is substituted for 'eale.'] Dyce (ed. i): 'Often' [in Steevens's reading] is very questionable, because, in all probability, 'of' in the Qq is a mistake for 'oft;' and secondly, as Lettsom observes to me, 'the words \"To his own scandal\" are fatal to the reading \"dout,\" for if that alteration be right they are superfluous. A verb,' he adds, 'I should think must lurk under the corruption \"a doubt\" or \"doubt,\" with the signification of turn, pervert, corrupt, or the like. Shakespeare's meaning evidently is that a little leaven leavens the whole lump—that one vice will ruin an otherwise perfect character.' Mason's conjecture was unknown to the Rev. J. Mitford when he wrote to me as follows: 'I would read \"Doth all the noble substance oft corrupt.\"' In the Devonshire dialect, to 'eale' is to reproach; it may be asked, then, Did Shakespeare (who occasionally has provincialisms) write here 'the dram of eale' in the sense of 'the dram of reproach'? for my own part, I hardly think so. White: I leave this grossly-corrupted passage unchanged, because none of the attempts to restore it seem to me to be even worth recording, and I am unable to better them. But it has occurred to me that perhaps the corruption lurks in a part of the passage hitherto unsuspected, and that 'Doth' is either a misprint of 'Hath,' or has the sense of 'accomplishes.' F. A. Leo (N. & Qu. 27 Dec. 1862): 'Eale,' in its real form, must have contained a sense opposite to 'noble,' and for that purpose I find no better word than vile. 'A doubt' I understand as a misprint for a draught; for Hamlet had just spoken about drinking, and had just used the word 'draughts.' After that I should like to change the word 'Doth' into Turns. Nichols [Notes on Sh. i, 25]: Eale is the old-fashioned mode of spelling ail = ailment, pronounced ale. 'Doth' is not the auxiliary verb, but the verb itself, the 3rd pers. sing. pres. tense of to do, which here means: 'to make anything what it is not,' as, 'to do him dead'—so in Johnson. 'Doubt' is the means whereby that change is effected, of and by formerly being used indifferently as a sign of the ablative. Hence the text of Q2Q3 means that 'the dram of eale will, by a doubt (i.e. by the doubt that it will create as to a man's sincerity) do (i.e. convert) all this noble substance to his own scandal, laying him open to the charge of hypocrisy.' [Nichols repeated this note substantially in The Athenaeum, 18 Aug. 1866. Ed.] Ingleby [ap. Staunton]: 'Of a doubt' is a misprint for derogate. First, they have the same number of letters. Secondly, they have the o, a, d, and t in common. Thirdly, derogate is the only verb that at the same time completes the sense and preserves the metre. Staunton: Ingleby's suggestion is ingenious, but may not the construction have been this: 'The dram of base (or ill, or bale, or lead, or whatsoever word the compositor tortured into \"eale,\" or \"ease\") doth [i.e. doeth, for doth] all the noble substance of a pound to its own vileness'? We by no means pretend that pound was the actual word misrendered 'doubt;' it is inserted merely because it occurs in opposition to 'dram' in a line of Quarles's Emblems, b. ii, E 7,—'Where ev'ry dram of gold contains a pound of dross,'—and because it is extremely probable some such antithesis was intended here. So in Spenser's Faerie Queene, b. i, c. iii, s. 30:—'A dram of sweete is worth a pound of sowre.' Swynfen Jervis (Proposed Emendations, &c. i860, p. 23): Read, The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance oft outdo, To, &c. Compare Cor. II, i, 150; 'So heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate.'—Par. Lost.; 'Wherein the graver had a strife With nature, to outdo the life.'—Jonson. In Chambers's Household Sh. is the following note: 'We have adopted \"oft subdue\" [for \"of a doubt\"], suggested by Mr Swynfen Jervis, and thus supported:—Son. iii, 6; and All's Well, V, iii, 217.' Bailey (ii, 2): For 'eale' read evil; for 'of a doubt' read oft weigh down. 'Weigh, in some of the old copies of Hamlet, is spelt way.' Compare Rich. III: V, iii, 153; Timon V, i, 154."

        "In Davies's Dram. Misc. (iii, 29) an account is given from Cibber of Betterton's acting in this scene; Betterton was taught by Sir William Davenant, who had seen Taylor, one of the original performers of Hamlet [see V, ii, 274]: 'He opened the scene with a pause of mute amazement; then, rising slowly to a solemn, trembling voice, he made the Ghost equally terrible to the spectator and himself; and, in the descriptive part of the natural emotions which the ghastly vision gave him, the boldness of his expostulation was still governed by decency; manly, but not braving; his voice never rising to that seeming outrage or wild defiance of what he naturally revered.' Booth said: 'When I acted the Ghost with Betterton, instead of my awing him, he terrified me. But divinity hung round that man.' On the other hand, Macklin, after the first line, spoke the rest of the address calmly but respectfully, and with a firm tone of voice, as from one who had subdued his timidity and apprehension. Booth, says Davies, has never been surpassed in his acting of the Ghost; his slow, solemn, and undertone of voice, his noiseless tread, as if he had been composed of air, created a powerful impression. Hunter (ii, 222): 'The idea of surprise predominates over the idea of apprehension. He did not mean that he needed protection in the presence of so gracious a figure, and the exclamation must be understood to escape him almost involuntarily. A pretty long pause should ensue after it is spoken, to allow him to recollect himself.' A stage direction [Pause] is added after this line by Collier (ed. ii), with the note: This minute stage direction, showing the particular manner of the old actor of the character of Hamlet, ought to be preserved, and is from the (MS). It seems natural that the performer should 'pause' to recover breath after this exclamation, and before he tremblingly proceeds to question the Ghost. We believe that the modern practice on our stage has been uniform in this respect,—possibly from the oldest tradition. [See Lichtenberg's account of Garrick, in the Appendix. Ed.]"

Windlaies is used by Fairfax, for sudden turns; whether he meant this word or another, is not quite clear: perhaps, rather, windings: — ‘The beauties faire of shepherd's daughters bold, With wanton windlaies runne, turne, play, and passe.’ — Tasso, xiv, 34. Hunter (ii, 226): Windlaces is used in a sense now forgotten. We find it in Golding's Ovid, the seventh book, the book in which Shakespeare was so well read: ‘— like a wily fox he runs not forth directly out, Nor makes a windlasse over all the champion fields about,’ &c. It is also used by Bishop Hacket. Edinburgh Review [Shakespearian Glossaries, July, 1869): In Shakespeare's day, windlace, literally, a winding, was used to express taking a circuitous course, fetching a compass, making an indirect advance, or, more colloquially, beating about the bush instead of going directly to a place or object; and in this sense it exactly harmonizes with the other phrase used by Polonius to express the same thing,—‘assays of bias,’—attempts in which, instead of going straight to the object, we seek to reach it by a curved or winding course, the bias gradually bringing the ball round to the Jack. Thus, in Golding's Ovid: ‘The winged God...Continued not directly forth, but gan me down to stoupe, And fetched a windlasse round about.’ Clarendon: Also Lily's Euphues and his England (ed. Arber), p. 270: ‘I now fetching a windlesse, that I myght better haue a shoote, was preuented with ready game.’",

The letter which Polonius reads to the King must, therefore, have belonged to a period before the opening of the drama. Ophelia had strictly obeyed her father's commands, and returned all Hamlet's letters. Thirdly, Polonius goes at once to the King, and yet, when he speaks to him of Hamlet, the King already knew of Hamlet's (feigned) insanity, and therefore must himself have seen the Prince before Ophelia saw him. Fourthly, between the close of the first act and the present scene, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern must have been summoned on account of Hamlet's changed demeanor, and of the King's suspicions which that demeanor had aroused."

Had Capell been aware of this, he would scarcly have designated Theobald's mistake as a 'downright falsehood.' Theobald at the time of writing his Sh. Restored knew of no Quarto earlier than that of 1637 (Sh. Rest. p. 70), and it is just possible that some copy of this edition (Q6) from which that of 1676 was printed may have had the reading 'loose.' [The Cam. Edd. refer to a note on III, iv, 59, where they give two different readings in two different copies of Q4, ‘a heaven-kissing’ in Ingleby's copy, and ‘a heaue, a kissing,’ in Capell's copy. This variation in copies of the same date has long been known to exist in the older Qq, but, I confess, I was not prepared to find much variation in later Qq of the same date.

Heath: The concealment of it may be attended with consequences productive of greater calamity than the displeasure can possibly be with which the disclosing it may be received. Caldecott: At the close of an act, or when the scene is shifted, and there is a pause in the action of the drama, it was the usage of our dramatists, down to the middle of the last century, not simply to divert attention from the main object, as here, by the introduction of a couplet or rhymes, but to make the subject of such couplet foreign altogether to the interests of the drama, an unconnected flourish, and that, not unfrequently, a labored and florid simile. Such a custom in Shakespeare, so far from being what Warburton calls it, was the very opposite of 'affectation;' not to have done it occasionally would have been an affectation of singularity. Clarendon: In the couplets which conclude scenes the sense is frequently sacrificed to the rhyme. The sense here seems to be — Hamlet's mad conduct might cause more grief if it were hidden than the revelation of his love for Ophelia would cause hatred, i.e. on the part of the King and Queen. Yet the Queen afterwards expresses her approval of the match, III, i, 38. Compare also, V, i, 231-234. Tschischwitz cannot persuade himself that the author of the Sonnets and of Venus & Adonis could have composed lines so faulty in logic and style as these, and he therefore thinks that even sticklers for the authorized text will pardon him for changing line 119 into ‘More grief to him, than hate to us their love.’ He also marks 'Ophelia exit' after line 126."

Lastly, the adverb becomes a causative conjunction; on the principle that \"propter hoc\" may be practically, though loosely, expressed by \"post hoc.\" That is, \"Sin thou are righteous judge\" means \"following on the fact that thou art a righteous judge.\" Clarendon: Marsh [Lectures on the English Language, pp. 584-586] says, that in the latter half of the sixteenth century \"good authors established a distinction between the forms, and used sith only as a logical word, an illative, while sithence and since, whether as prepositions or as adverbs, remained mere narrative words confined to the signification of time after.\" Sh., it is clear, did not observe this distinction, whether we take the quartos or the folios to represent his exact text. [See IV, iv, 45.]."

        "Johnson: Polonius is a man bred in courts, exercised in business, stored with observation, confident in his eloquence, and declining into dotage. His mode of oratory is truly represented as designed to ridicule the practice of those times, of prefaces that made no introduction, and of method that embarrassed rather than explained. This part of his character is accidental, the rest is natural. Such a man is positive and confident, because he knows that his mind was once strong, and knows not that it is become weak. Such a man excels in general principles, but fails in the particular application. He is knowing in retrospect, and ignorant in foresight. While he depends upon his memory, and can draw from his repositories of knowledge, he utters weighty sentences, and gives useful counsel; but as the mind in its enfeebled state cannot be kept long busy and intent, the old man is subject to sudden dereliction of his faculties; he loses the order of his ideas, and entangles himself in his own thoughts, till he recovers the leading principle, and falls again into his former train. This idea of dotage encroaching upon wisdom will solve all the phenomena of the character of Polonius. Caldecott: Nothing can be more easily conceivable or intelligible than the \"idea of dotage encroaching upon wisdom\"; but does this apply to Polonius? To be extinguished, talent or faculty must first have existence. Now we have nothing that directly goes to establish the fact of his having at any time a clear and commanding intellect. Almost everything has, on the contrary, an opposite bearing; for the very quality relied upon by Dr Johnson appears to us to be that which most strongly indicates imbecility of mind, viz. having the memory stored with sage rules and maxims, fit for every turn and occasion, without the faculty of making effective use of them upon any. In Polonius's general conduct, unmixed folly or dotage is visible at every turn. Moberly: In estimating this character we should do well to remember that the use of language like that of Polonius would not in Shakespeare's euphuistic days argue the complete folly that it would at the present time.

        "Alfred Roffe (N. & Q. 5 Oct. 1861) gives a list of no less than nine metrical and musical adaptations of this letter of Hamlet's. One of them, in date about 1800, \"Composed for and dedicated to Miss Abrams by Michael Kelly,\" is as follows: \"Doubt (O most beautified), that the stars are fire, Doubt (my soul's idol), that the sun doth move, Doubt that eternal Truth may prove a liar, But, sweet Ophelia, never doubt I love. My mind no skill in these fond numbers owns, Yet these declare I love thee best, most best, And though no Muses reckon up my groans, These lines may shelter in thy snowy breast.",
        "Theobald objected to [beautified], because of its two meanings, viz. artificial and natural beauty; the first would be manifestly inappropriate here, and the second Sh. has used in Two Gent. IV, i, 55, and would not, therefore, here call it a \"vile phrase.\" He therefore substituted beatified, which is less of an anticlimax than \"beautified,\" after \"Celestial and soul's idol,\" and which, moreover, would be the more likely to excite the Roman Catholic Polonius to anger, since it is almost peculiarly applied to the Virgin Mary. Capell (i, 130) prefers beatified, because of \"its concordance with 'celestial' and 'idol,' and because the passage demands it, which is certainly verse.\" Accordingly, he reads lines 119 to 122, inclusive, as verse, dividing at \"idol\" (which, metri gratis, he reads \"fair idol\"), \"Ophelia,\" \"beautified\" (which he reads \"that beatify'd\"), \"these.\" Johnson: \"Beautified\" seems to be a vile phrase for the ambiguity of its meaning. Steevens: Nash dedicates his Christ's Tears over Jerusalem, 1594, \"To the most beautified lady, the lady Elizabeth Carey.\" Nares: A common word in those times, particularly in the addresses of letters. The examples wherein a person is said to be \"beautified\" with various endowments seem hardly apposite. Caldecott: That is, accomplished, \"metricall speach ... by Art bewtified and adorned, and brought far from the primitiue rudenesse.\"—Puttenham's Arte of English Poesie, 1589 [p. 39, ed. Arber]. DYCE (Gloss.): By \"beautified\" (which, however \"vile a phrase,\" is common enough in our early writers) I believe Hamlet meant beautiful, and not accomplished."

White: The obvious reading for has occurred to many critical readers; and to modern taste this would seem an improvement. But similar phrases are of common occurrence in old books. Staunton: \"Four\" here, as in Cor. I, vi, 84, and elsewhere, appears a mere colloquialism, to signify some, or a limited number, as forty is frequently used to express a great number. Clarendon: So in Puttenham's Arte of English Poesie (p. 307, ed.

        "Whiter (p. 152, foot-note) cites a passage from Jonson's Masque at Christmas (vol. vii, p. 277, ed. Gifford), where Venus, who is represented as a deaf tire-woman, says that she was \"a fishmonger's daughter.\" \"Probably, it was supposed,\" adds Whiter, \"that the daughters of these tradesmen, who dealt in so nourishing a species of food, were blessed with extraordinary powers of conception.\" Hence he infers some such allusion by Hamlet. Gifford, in his note on this passage in Jonson, says: \"This alludes to the prolific nature of fish. The jest, which, such as it is, is not unfrequent in our old dramatists, needs no further illustration.\" Malone: Perhaps a joke was here intended. \"Fishmonger\" was a cant term for a wencher. In Barnabe Rich's Irish Hubbub: \"Senex fornicator, an old fishmonger.\" Coleridge: That is, you are sent to fish out this secret. This is Hamlet's own meaning. Moberly: Probably the meaning may be: \"You deal in wares that will not bear the sun;\" that is, that Polonius has a daughter, and that all women are as faithless and unchaste as his mother, so that the least trial overthrows them. TIECK (Kritische Schriften, iii, 262): When this word is spoken the sense may be made so obvious that one can hardly miss it: \"I would you were so honest a man—but — you are a fleshmonger.\" You are a pander, not so honest a man as a fishmonger. Hamlet casts in the teeth of Polonius that he made opportunities for him and his daughter, and the following speech: \"For if the sun,\" &c. is only a continuation of the expression of Hamlet's contempt for both father and daughter. Friesen (Briefe über Hamlet, 1864, p. 287) supposes this rather refers to Polonius's share in providing opportunities for Claudius and the Queen, during the old king's lifetime. Doering [Shakespeare's Hamlet, &c. 1865, p. 51] refers it to Polonius's aid in promoting the marriage of Claudius and the Queen. See, also, Gerth's extraordinary proverb in his note on this passage in Appendix, Vol. II."

      "notes": [
        "Capell: good kissing carrion.] finding Polonius still watching him, he should turn sharply round with the abrupt question, \"Have you a daughter?\" It is this view of the stage business which prompted us to print the passage above [line 150. For ... carrion] as something read, or affected to be read, by Hamlet, — an innovation — if it be one (for we are ignorant whether it has been suggested previously) — that will the more readily be pardoned, since the passage, as usually exhibited, has hitherto defied solution.",
        "Heussi: good kissing carrion.] \"Kissing\" is used in a passive Sense; a contrast is drawn between carrion and bad men. The former is praised, because the dead dog is a carrion that fulfils all requirement of carrion, whereas men are inferior to that which they should be.",
        "Tschischwitz: good kissing carrion.] The meaning is clear. If the sun, a good being, condescends so far as to kiss, &c. [He therefore transposes the words in the text, \"being a good,\" and reads a good being. Ed.]",
        "Hudson: good kissing carrion.] God is probably right. A great deal of ink has been spent in trying to explain the passage; but the true explanation is, that it is not meant to be understood. Hamlet is merely bantering and tantalizing the old man.",
        "Moberly: good kissing carrion.] Warburton's explanation is excellent.",
        "Clarendon: good kissing carrion.] There can be little doubt of the truth of Warburton's emendation.",
        "Corson: good kissing carrion.] The defect in this passage is due to one thing, and one thing only, and that is, to the understanding of \"kissing\" as the present active participle, and not as the verbal noun. In the following passages the present active participle is used: \"Life's but a walking shadow,\" Macb. V, v, 24; \"Look, here comes a walking fire,\" Lear, III, iv, no; \"the dancing banners of the French,\" King John, II, i, 308; \"my dancing soul doth celebrate This feast,\" Rich. II: I, iii, 91; \"laboring art can never ransom nature,\" AW's Well, II, i, 116; \"more busy than the laboring spider,\" 2 Hen. VI; III, i, 339; \"And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas,\" Oth. II, i, 184; \"thy parting soul,\" 1 Hen. VI: II, v, 115; \"parting guest,\" Tro. & Cres. III, iii, 166; \"a falling fabric,\" Cor. III, i, 247; \"this breathing world,\" Rich. Ill: I, i, 21; \"O blessed breeding sun,\" Tim. of Ath. IV, iii, I. But in the following passages the same words are verbal nouns used adjectively: \"a palmer's walking-staff,\" Rich. II: III, iii, 151; \"you and I are past our dancing days,\" Rom. & Jul. I, v, 29; \"you ought not walk Upon a laboring day,\" Jul. Cæs. I, i, 4; \"Give him that parting kiss,\" Cymb. I, iii, 34; \"what store of parting tears were shed?\" Rich. II: I, iv, 5; \"the falling sickness,\" Jul. Cæs. I, ii, 252; \"scarce a breathing while,\" Rich. Ill: I, iii, 60; \"it is the breathing time of day with me,\" Ham. V, ii, 165. And now we are all ready for \"kissing.\" In the following passages it is the participle: \"A kissing traitor,\" Love's L. L. V, ii, 592; Cymb. III, iv, 164; \"O, how ripe in show Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow,\" Mid. N. D, III, ii, 140. \"Kissing,\" in the last passage, might be taken for the verbal noun, meaning, for kissing, or, to be kissed; but it must here be understood as the participle. Demetrius speaks of the lips of Helena as two ripe cherries that kiss, or lightly touch each other. But to say of a pair of beautiful lips, that they are good kissing lips, would convey quite a different meaning, — a meaning, however, which nobody would mistake; \"kissing,\" in such expression, is the verbal noun used adjectively, and equivalent to \"for kissing.\" And so the word is used in the present passage in Hamlet. That is, a dead dog being, not a carrion good at kissing (which would be the sense of the word as a present active participle), but a carrion good for kissing, or, to be kissed, by the sun, that thus breeds a plentiful crop of maggots therein, the agency of \"breed\" being implied in \"kissing.\" In reading this speech, the emphasis should be upon \"kissing,\" and not upon \"carrion,\" the idea of which last word is anticipated in \"dead dog;\" in other words, \"kissing carrion\" should be read as a compound noun, which, in fact, it is, the stress of sound falling on the member of the compound which bears the burden of the meaning. The two words might, indeed, be hyphened, like \"Kissing-comfits,\" in Merry Wives,V, v, 19. The life-awakening power of the sun is expressed in the following passages, which commentators have not quoted, I believe, in illustration of the passage in Hamlet: \"By the fire That quickens Nilus' slime,\" Ant. & Cleo. I, iii, 69; \"Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of the sun: so is your crocodile,\" II, vii, 26. [This note is so exhaustive and so conclusive that, although the interpretation which it offers has been anticipated by Caldecott, I have nevertheless given it almost at full length. Ed.]"

That the inferior interlocutors in the dialogue speak in prose also is, of course, sufficiently explained by the natural tendency of every man to carry on a conversation in the tone which the chief speaker gives it. But why Hamlet himself speaks prose is explained by comparing his prose with his verse speeches. We then find that he always returns to verse as the language of his practical life, whether in relation to feeling or to action; whereas, while he speaks prose, he is uttering the thoughts of the bystander and looker-on, contemplating, or aiming at contemplating, the world, with the cold passionless eye of the intellect. I say aiming at contemplating, for Hamlet is too young and ardent, and his griefs are too fresh, for his skepticism to become the real habit of his soul; and, accordingly, we see a bitter self- consciousness working up through it at every moment. Still, in as far as it is the looking on of a spectator, and not the participation of an actor, it is passionless, at least in form, — the reading out of a book, rather than the utterance of living speech."

To cote is thus not simply to overtake, but to overpass, to outstrip, this being the distinctive meaning of the term. Going beyond is the essential point, the term being usually applied under circumstances where overtaking is impossible, — to dogs who start together and run abreast until the cote takes place.

It is, in fact, a pall or stop-catch. When the trigger is made to act on one end of it, the other end releases the tumbler, the mainspring acts, and the hammer, flint, or match falls. Hence Lombard (1596), as quoted in Halliwell's Archaic Dict., says, \"Even as a pistole that is ready charged and bent will flie off by-and-by, if a man do but touch the seare.\" Now if the lock be so made of purpose, or be worn, or be faulty in construction, this sear, or grip, may be so tickle or ticklish in its adjustment that a slight touch or even jar may displace it, and then, of course, the gun goes off. Hence \"light,\" or \"tickle of the sear\" (equivalent to, like a hair- trigger), applied metaphorically, means that which can be started into action at a mere touch, or on the slightest provocation, or on what ought to be no provocation at all.",
        "Clarendon: tickle o' the sere] The real meaning is just the reverse of \"those to whom laughter is most uneasy.\" In old matchlock muskets the sear and trigger were in one piece. This is proved by a passage from Barret's Theorike and Practike of Modern Warres, 1598, p. 33 [35]: \"drawing down the serre with the other three fingers.\" He has given directions for holding the stock between the thumb and forefinger. It is clear that Hamlet did not anticipate much from the wit of the clown, or from the players generally."

        "Steevens: inhibition] Any change in the order of the words is quite unnecessary. Rosencrantz means that their permission to act any longer at an established house is taken away in consequence of the new custom of introducing personal abuse into their comedies. Several companies of actors in the time of Sh. were silenced on account of this licentious practice.",
        "Malone: inhibition] Sh. could not mean to charge his friends, the old tragedians, with the new custom of introducing personal abuse, but rather must have meant, that the old tragedians were inhibited from performing in the city and obliged to travel on account of the misconduct of the younger company. And he could not have directed his satire at those young men who played occasionally at his own theatre. Jonson's Cynthia's Revels and Poetaster were performed there by the Children of Queen Elizabeth's chapel in 1600 and 1601; and Eastward Hoe by the Children of the Revels in 1604 or 1605. I have no doubt, therefore, that the present dialogue was pointed at the choir boys of St Paul's, who in 1601 acted two of Marston's plays: Antonio and Mellida, and Antonio's Revenge. Many of Lyly's plays were represented by them about the same time; and, in 1607, Chapman's Bussy d'Ambois was performed by them with great applause. It was probably in this and some other noisy tragedies of the same kind that they \"cried out on the top of question, and were most tyrannically clapped for it.\" The licentiousness of the stage is noticed in a letter from Mr Samuel Calvert to Mr Winwood, 28 March, 1605, which might lead us to infer that the words found only in the Folio were added at that time: \"The plays do not forbear to present upon the stage the whole course of this present time, not sparing the king, state, or religion, in so great absurdity and with such liberty that any would be afraid to hear them.\" — Memorials, ii, 54. Or the words in the Folio might have been added in 1612, in which year Heywood's Apologie for Actors was published, containing the following passage, which leads us to infer that the little eyases were the persons guilty of the late innovation, or practice of introducing personal abuse on the stage: \"Now to speake of some abuse lately crept into the quality, as an inueighing against the State, the Court, the Law, the Citty, and their gouernements, with the particularizing of priuate mens humors (yet alive) Noble-men & others. I know it distastes many; neither do I any way approue it, nor dare I by any means excuse it. The liberty which some arrogate to themselues, committing their bitternesse, and liberall inuectiues against all estates, to the mouthes of Children, supposing their iuniority to be a priuiledge for any rayling, be it neuer so violent, I could aduise all such, to curbe and limit this presumed liberty within the bands of discretion and gouernment. But wise and juditial Censurers, before whom such complaints shall at any time hereafter come, wil not (I hope) impute these abuses to any transgression in vs, who haue euer been carefull and prouident to shun the like.\" Caldecott thinks that they were obliged to travel because of the license granted to a new description of actors, who had met with the most extravagant applauses and success.",
        "Collier: inhibition] This passage probably refers to the limiting of public theatrical performances to the two theatres, the Globe on the Bankside, and the Fortune in Golden Lane, in 1600 and 1601. The players, by a \"late innovation,\" were \"inhibited,\" or forbidden, to act in or near \"the city,\" and therefore travelled, or strolled, into the country. See Collier's Hist. of Engl. Dram. Poetry and the Stage, i, 311.",

        "WARBURTON: handsaw] Hanmer's alteration serves to show us the origin of the proverb which was a common one in Shakespeare's day. Capell (i, 133): The speaker's meaning is that opportunity did not serve for his purpose; when it did, it would be seen he had his right senses. Nares: Hernshaw, heronshaw, or hernshew is a heron or hern. 'As when a cast of falcons make their flight, At an hernshaw, that lyes aloft on wing.'—Spenser, Fairie Queene, VI, vii, 9. 'To know a hawk from a hernshaw?' was certainly the original form of the proverb. But the corruption had taken place before the time of Sh. It is handsaw in Ray's Proverbs, p. 196, ed. 1768. White: I suspect that in Shakespeare's time the corrupted phrase had, to general acceptation, lost its original meaning, and that the comparison was supposed to be between the tool called a hawk and a handsaw. There was, and I believe there still is, a hooked cutting tool called a hawk. Halliwell: No evidence in support of the supposition that 'handsaw' is a corruption of hernshaw has been produced; the phrase always occurs in this form. It is not necessary to believe that the supposition is correct, the wildest incongruities being often found in proverbial phrases of this description. It is suggested by C. W. H. in the Athenaeum (30 December, 1865), that Sh. might have become acquainted, through North's Plutarch, with the significations attached by the ^Egyptians to the hawk and heron respectively,—the former was the emblem of the North wind, and the latter of the South wind. 'Hamlet, though feigning madness, yet claims sufficient sanity to distinguish a hawk from a hernshaw when the wind is southerly; that is, in the time of the migration of the latter to the north, when the former is not to be seen.' J. A. G. (N. & Qu. 6 July, 1867) suggests anser, 'the generic name for our domestic waterfowl.' J. A. Picton (N. & Qu. 30 Nov. 1872) suggests that 'hawk' may refer, not only to the bill-hook, mentioned by White, but also to a plasterer's instrument so named. Clarendon: In Suffolk and Norfolk 'hernsew is pronounced 'harnsa,' from which to 'handsaw' is but a single step. For the following explanation of the earlier part of this obscure passage, we are indebted to Mr J. C. Heath, formerly Fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge: 'The expression obviously refers to the sport of hawking. Most birds, especially one of heavy flight like the heron, when roused by the falconer or his dog, would fly down or with the wind, in order to escape. When the wind is from the north, the heron flies towards the south, and the spectator may be dazzled by the sun, and be unable to distinguish the hawk from the heron. On the other hand, when the wind is southerly, the heron flies towards the north, and it and the pursuing hawk are clearly seen by the sportsman, who then has his back to the sun, and without difficulty knows the hawk from the hernsew. A curious reader may further observe that a wind from the precise point north-north-we3t would be in the eye of the sun at half-past ten in the forenoon, a likely time for hawking, whereas \"southerly\" includes a wider range of wind for a good view.' [I have heard the emendation suggested of handschuh, the German for glove, but cannot remember that I have ever seen it in print. Heath's explanation sets the question at rest, if 'handsaw' be a corruption of hernsew. Ed.]"

Caldecott: 'For the observance of the rules of the drama, while they take such liberties as are allowable, they are the only men.' Collier: The meaning probably is, that the players were good, whether at written productions or at extemporal plays, where liberty was allowed to the performers to invent the dialogue, in imitation of the Italian commedie al improviso. See Hist, of Engl. Dram. Poetry, iii, 393. Walker (Crit. iii, 265): Read wit. 'Writ' for composition is not English. It is as if we should say, the laws of poem for the laws of poetry, or talk of so and so being contrary to the genius of ode, meaning the genius of lyrical composition. The passages quoted by the Var. commentators are utterly irrelevant. The same erratum occurs, Jul. Cas. Ill, ii, 225 : 'For I haue neyther writ nor words, nor worth.' Clarendon: Probably the author did not intend that we should find a distinct meaning in Polonius's words. Corson: The Qq and Ff connect in construction, 'for the law of writ and the liberty,' with Seneca and Plautus, and not with 'these are the only men,' which evidently refers to the actors he's talking about. • Liberty ' should be construed with ' law ;' the law and the liberty of writ [writing].

        "Steevens: Jephthah] Steevens communicated to Dr Percy the old song from which Hamlet quotes, and it appeared in the second edition of Percy's Reliques in 1757. There are two entries of this ballad on the Registers of the Stationers' Company: in 1567 -6a, • Alexandre lacye ' was licensed to print ' a ballet intituled the songe of Jesphas Dowg*her at his death.' [Arber's Transcript, i, 355. *His death ' is a clerical error for 'her death.' Collier, in vol. xiii, p. 169, Sh. Soc. Publications, seems to doubt if this be the same ballad as that quoted by Hamlet. Ed.] The second entry is 1 Jeffa Judge of Israel,' p. 93, vol. iii, Dec. 14, 1624. Halliwell gives a facsimile of 'A proper new ballad, intituled, Jepha yudge of Jfrael? of which the first stanza runs as follows: ' I read that many yeare agoe, When Jepha Judge of Jsrael, Had one fair Daughter and no more, whom he loved so passing well. And as by lot God wot, It came to passe most like it was, Great warrs ther thould be, and who should be the chiefe, but he, but he.' Copies of this ballad differ slightly from each other, says Halliwell. Malone refers to Latin tragedies on this subject by Christopherson, 1546, and by Buchanan, 1554, and thinks it had probably been introduced on the English stage. Ccllier shows from Henslowe's Diary (pp. 220, 221, 222, and 223) that, in 1602, Dekker and Chettle were paid for a tragedy they were writing on the story of Jephthah, and that the subject, therefore, was popularly known by means of ballads and the stage."

Steevens defines 'pious chansons' as ballads containing some scriptural history, sung about the streets, and the 'first row' is the first column of the roughly printed sheet. Nares thinks the reading of the Ff apparently nonsense. Shakespeare intended, perhaps, to mix French and English, but both seem to have been corrupted by the players and printers. Singer (ed. 1) really decides the question by an appeal to Qt, where the corresponding phrase is 'the firft verfe of the godly Ballet' [line 1016]. But Hunter (New Illust. ii, 232) opened the question again by advocating the reading of the F , on the score of its being the latest intention of the poet, and the proper one. *In fact, in France, the trivial ballad, such as that referred to, is called in ordinary discourse a pons chanson, or a chanson du Pont Neuf \"Vaudevilles, ou Chanson du Pont Neuf, les chansons communes qui se chantent parmi le peuple avec une grande facilite, et sans art: Trivialis cantilena\" — Dictionnaire de Trevoux, s. v. Chanson.'' In reply to Hunter, Knight [ap. Dyce] pertinently asks: 'A popular ballad is called even in modern dictionaries a chanson du Pont Neuf,—but where is the authority for Pons Chanson?' [According to Littre, the secondary meaning of Pont-Neuf is: 'Chanson populaire sur un air tres-connu, e. g. II sait tous les ponts-neufs qui courent les rues.' (In this sense it is not printed with capital letters.) But nowhere does he give such a phrase as pons chansons nor chanson, used absolutely when meaning the specific chansons du pont-neuf Ed.]"

Reed: Tom Coryat, in his Crudities, 1611, p. 262, calls them chapineys, and gives the following account of them: • There is one thing used of the Venetian women, and some others dwelling in the cities and townes subject to the signiory of Venice, that is not to bo observed (I thinke) amongst any other women in Christendome : which is common in Venice, that no woman whatsoever goeth without it, either in her house or abroad, a thing made of wood and covered with leather of sundry colors ; some with white, some redde, some yellow. It is called 'a chapiney, which they wear under their shoes. Many of them are curiously painted; some also of them I have seen fairely gilt: so uncomely a thing (in my opinion) that it is pitty this foolish custom is not cleane banished and exterminated out of the citie. There are many of these chapineys of a great height, even half a yard high, which maketh many of their women that are very short, seeme much taller than the tallest women we have in England. Also I have heard it observed among them, that by how much the nobler a woman is, by so much the higher are her chapineys. All their gentlewomen and most of their wives and widowes that are of any wealth, are assisted and supported eyther by men or women, when they walke abroad, to the end they may not fall. They are borne up most commonly by the left arme, otherwise they might quickly take a fall.' Malone: Minsheu defines 'Chapin de muger, a womans shooes, such as they use in Spaine, mules, or high corke shooes? There is no synonymous word in the Italian. Boswell said that cioppino is in Veneroni's Dictionary, but Dyce (Gloss.) says that none of the Italian Dictionaries in his possession contain the word. [It is not in Baretti. Singer says that it is recorded under the title of zoccolo, which, however, means simply a sandal, or patten.] Douce: In Raymond's Voyage through Italy, 1648, we find: 'This place [Venice] is much frequented by the walking may poles, I meane the women. They weare their coats halfe too long for their bodies, being mounted on their chippeens, (which are as high as a man's leg), they walke between two handmaids, majestickly deliberating of every step they take. This fashion was invented and appropriated to the noble Venitian wives, to bee constant to distinguish them from the courtesans, who goe covered in a vaile of white taffety.' The choppine, or some kind of high shoe, was occasionally used in England. Bulwer, in his Artificial Changeling [1653], complains of this fashion as a monstrous affectation, and says that his countrywomen therein imitated the Venetian and Persian ladies. In Sandys's travels, 1615, there is a figure of a Turkish lady with chopines; it is not improbable that the Venetians borrowed them from the Greek Islands. Singer: Perhaps Hamlet may have some allusion to the boy having grown so as to fill the place of a tragedy heroine, and so assumed the cothurnus; which Puttenham described as 'high corked shoes, or pantofles, which now they call in Spaine and Italy Shoppini.1 [Singer misunderstood the passage in Puttenham (see Arber's Rep. p. 49)... At a Jewish wedding in Jerusalem at which I was present, in 1856, the young bride, aged twelve, wore chopines at least ten inches high. Ed.]"

        "Heath: sallets] This is spoken in approbation, not in disparagement, of the play. The sense is: it wanted the high seasoning of loose ribaldry and luscious double meanings. GiFFORD defends Pope's reading, on the strength of a line in one of Jonson's Epigrams (Works, vol. viii, p. 177): 'I have no salt, no bawdry he doth mean;' and pronounces 'sallets' as akin to nonsense. Singer: 'Salt' was probably intended. 'Salt, a pleasaunt and merrie word, that maketh folks to laugh, and sometimes pricketh.' — Baret. Dyce: In spite of Gifford's note, I think the alteration to salt a hasty one — 'sallets,' i. e. salt (ribald) words and allusions (see Richardson's Dictionary for the etymology of salad or sallet). Collier (ed. 2): The (MS) has 'salt,' perhaps wrongly, though sallets or salads seems not easily understood. The allusion may have been particular and temporary. Clarendon: Pope was probably not aware that fragrant and piquant herbs were mixed with the salad."

        "Steevens: jig] A jig was not, in Shakespeare's time, only a dance, but a ludicrous dialogue in metre, and of the lowest kind, like Hamlet's conversation with Ophelia [III, ii, 105-115]. In The Hog hath lost his Pearl, 1614, one of the players comes to solicit a gentleman to wri'e a jig for him. Many of these jigs are entered in the Stationers' Company: — 'Philips his Jigg of the Slyppers,' 1595; 'Kempe's Jigg of the Kitchen-stuff Woman,' 1595. Malone: So, also, in the Prologue to Fletcher's Love's Pilgrimage [misquoted; it should be the Fair Maid of the Inn — Collier's Hist. Eng. Dram. Poetry, iii, 380]: 'A jig shall be clapp'd at, and every rhyme Prais'd and applauded,' &c. A jig was not always in the form of a dialogue; it signified a ludicrous metrical composition, as well as a dance. So in Florio: 'Frottola, a countrie gigge, or round, or countrie song, or wanton verse.' Collier (Hist. Eng. Dram. Poetry, iii, 380): We have no extant specimen of any such performance. It seems to have been a ludicrous composition in rhyme, sung, or said, by the clown, and accompanied by dancing and playing upon the pipe and tabor. Singer: Giga, in Italian, was a fiddle or crowd. Hence jig (first written gigge, though pronounced with g soft, after the Italian) was a ballad or ditty sung to a fiddle. Dyce {Note on Prologue to Fair Maid of the Inn): More persons than one were sometimes employed in a jig; and there is reason to believe that the performance was of considerable length, lasting even, on some occasions, for an hour. Clarendon: See Cotgrave, 'Farce: f. A (fond and dissolute) Play, Comedie, or Enterlude; also, the Iyg at the end of an Enterlude, wherein some pretie knauerie is acted.' [See Chappell {Popular Music of the Olden Time, p. 495), where the tune is given of The King's Jig, which is supposed to have been one of the tunes to which Charles II danced. Collier says that some of Tarleton's jigs, both music and words, survive in MS.]"

Upton (p. 299): This designedly affected expression seems to be formed from Virg. sEn. ii, 40 : MagnS. comitante caterva, i. e. mob- led Queen. Farmer: 'The moon does mobble up herself.' — Shirley's Gentleman of Venice. Holt White: It is nothing but a depravation of muffled. 'Mobbled nine days in my considering cap.' — Ogilby's Fables. Malone: A few lines lower we are told that she had 'a clout' upon her head. To mab (in the North pronounced mob), says Ray, in his Diet. of North Country Words, is 'to dress carelessly. Mabs are slatterns.' COLERIDGE: A mob-cap is still a word in common use for a morning-cap, which conceals the whole head of hair, and passes under the chin. It is nearly the same as the night-cap, that is, it is an imitation of it, so as to answer the purpose ('I am not drest for company'), and yet reconciling it with neatness and perfect purity. Delius: The real meaning which Sh. attached to it here is still doubtful; that an unusual word was intended is plain, both from Hamlet's objection to it and Polonius's approval of it. G. H. of S. (Ar. & Qu. 23 July, 1864) suggests maddled, a word in use in Yorkshire, meaning not absolutely mad, but bewildered almost to madness."

        "WARBURTON: Niggard] This is given as the description of the conversation of a man whom the speaker found not forward to be sounded; and who kept aloof when they would bring him to confession: but such a description can never pass but at cross purposes. Shakespeare certainly wrote it just the other way [see Textual Notes]. That this is the true reading, we need but to turn back to the preceding scene, for Hamlet's conduct, to be satisfied. Mason: Warburton forgets that by question, Shakespeare does not usually mean interrogatory, but discourse; yet in whichever sense the word be taken, this account given by Rosencrantz agrees but ill with the scene between him and Hamlet as actually represented. Malone: Slow to begin conversation, but free enough in his answers to our demands. Guildenstern has just said that Hamlet kept aloof when they wished to bring him to confess the cause of his distraction: Rosencrantz therefore here must mean, that up to that point, till they touch'd on that, he was free enough in his answers. Hunter (ii, 236): According to Warburton’s reading, the account is that which the lords must have rendered of their interview with Hamlet, if they meant to report it truly. Warburton's emendation has not had justice done to it by other commentators, but we find it confirmed by Q1. Staunton: Unless 'question' is admitted to mean argument, Warburton's emendation yields a truer description of Hamlet's bearing towards his schoolfellows than that afforded by the old text. TSCHISCHWITZ finds an insuperable objection to Warburton's emendation because it would represent Hamlet as not 'gentlemanlike' in asking many questions and niggard in replying. 'It is manifest that Rosencrantz here merely gives utterance to a rule of good manners.' Clarke: If it be borne in mind that Shakespeare employs 'of' very variously, and that he occasionally uses the word 'question' to signify 'inquisition,' 'cross-examining,' it appears to be evident that here 'niggard of question' elliptically expresses 'sparing of speech when we cross-examined him;' and if it be remembered how peculiarly Shakespeare sometimes employs the possessive case, we think it will be perceived that here 'of our demands' is employed to express 'of demands respecting ourselves.' Thus, then, we take the whole speech to mean—'He was sparing of speech when we questioned him: but of demands respecting ourselves he was very free in return:' which interpretation completely tallies with the circumstances as they really occurred. Clarendon: Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were completely baffled, and Hamlet had the talk almost to himself. Perhaps they did not intend to give a correct account of the interview.",
        "Collier (ed. 2): of our demands] 'Of' is altered to 'to' in the (MS), but needlessly, because 'of' has here the force of 'on'. Clarendon: 'Of' may be written either by attraction from the previous 'of,' or it may be used for 'on,' as in Marlowe's Jew of Malta, IV, iv: 'Of that condition I will drink it up.' [See Abbott, § 173, which may perhaps apply to this use of 'of.' Ed.]"

      "notes": [
        "Johnson: To be, or not to be.] Of this celebrated soliloquy, which bursting from a man distracted with contrariety of desires, and overwhelmed with the magnitude of his own purposes, is connected rather in the speaker's mind than on his tongue, I shall endeavor to discover the train, and to show how one sentiment produces another. Hamlet, knowing himself injured in the most enormous and atrocious degree, and seeing no means of redress but such as must expose him to the extremity of hazard, meditates on his situation in this manner: Before I can form any rational scheme of action under this pressure of distress, it is necessary to decide whether, after our present state, we are to be, or not to be. That is the question, which, as it shall be answered, will determine whether 'tis nobler, and more suitable to the dignity of reason, to suffer the outrages of fortune patiently, or to take arms against them, and by opposing end them, though perhaps with the loss of life. If to die were to sleep, no more, and by a sleep to end the miseries of our nature, such a sleep were devoutly to be wished; but if to sleep in death be to dream, to retain our powers of sensibility, we must pause to consider in that sleep of death what dreams may come. This consideration makes calamity so long endured; for who would bear the vexations of life, which might be ended by a bare bodkin, but that he is afraid of something in unknown futurity? This fear it is that gives efficacy to conscience, which, by turning the mind upon this regard, chills the ardor of resolution, checks the vigor of enterprise, and makes the current of desire stagnate in inactivity. We may suppose that he would have applied these general observations to his own case, but that he discovered Ophelia. Malone: Dr Johnson's explication of the first five lines of this passage is surely wrong. Hamlet is not deliberating whether after our present state we are to exist or not, but whether he should continue to live, or put an end to his life; as is pointed out by the second and the three following lines, which are manifestly a paraphrase on the first: 'Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer, &c, or to take arms.' The question concerning our existence in a future state is not considered till the tenth line: 'To sleep! perchance to dream!' &c. See R. of L. 1154. Coleridge: This speech is of absolutely universal interest,—and yet to which of all Shakespeare's characters could it appropriately have been given but to Hamlet? For Jaques it would have been too deep, and for Iago too habitual a communion with the heart; which in every man belongs, or ought to belong, to all mankind. Lamb (Works, vol. iii, p. 88. London, 1870): How far the very custom of hearing anything spouted, withers and blows upon a fine passage, may be seen in those speeches from Hen. V., &c, which are current in the mouths of schoolboys, from their being to be found in Enfield's Speaker, and such kind of books. I confess myself utterly unable to appreciate that celebrated soliloquy in Hamlet, beginning, 'To be, or not to be,' or to tell whether it be good, bad, or indifferent; it has been so handled and pawed about by declamatory boys and men, and torn so inhumanly from its living place and principle of continuity in the play, till it has become to me a perfect dead member. CALDECOTT, criticising Dr Johnson, says that the train of thought is obvious enough; it is only the grammatical thread that technically may call for some unwinding. He denies that any doubt is here raised by Hamlet as to a future state of existence,—Hamlet is questioning solely what the condition of such existence is to be. A desire to be out of the world is one of the most strongly-marked features of Hamlet's character. It is the first wish he utters when alone: I, ii, 129. But he is then restrained from anything beyond a wish for suicide by religious scruples. The inclination now returns upon him more forcibly (having more cause for such an impulse), and the prohibition of Heaven does not enter into consideration. It is here only, what he shall change his life for. This is the language and subject of a man's mind who is nearer death, than he who only wishes that it were lawful to kill himself.' Hunter (ii, 236): This soliloquy is placed in Q1 at the beginning of what is now Act II. It stands there most appropriately. We have seen, at the close of Act I, the state of Hamlet's mind immediately on having received the dread information and the solemn command of the Ghost; we are next presented with what was the state of his mind after a few days' reflection. He enters solus, in a meditative mood, and the subjects of his meditations are among the most awful which can engage mortal thoughts. This is to show his natural mind. Then follows the dialogue with Ophelia, which is intended to show us his artificial mind,— that idle, wandering folly which he assumed, the better to accomplish his object. I can conceive nothing more dramatically proper than this. It prepares for all the succeeding action in which the natural and the artificial Hamlet are so wildly combined. Why there was a change in the arrangement, or by whom it was made, I can no more explain than I can account for many other things connected with the publication of these dramas. But that the play is greatly injured by the change I feel a confident conviction; for not only is this soliloquy wanting in the place most appropriate to it, but it is now found in a place not suitable to it. Such meditations as these are not such as were likely to arise in the mind of one who had just conceived a design by which he hoped to settle a doubt of a very serious kind, and who must have been full of curiosity about the issue of his plot. If this speech is to indicate deliberation concerning suicide, or is even allied to suicide, such deliberation is surely out of place when curiosity was awake, and his mind deeply intent on something that he must do. To be sure, the hypothesis of Inconsistency will explain all; but then it will explain anything. Another very material effect is produced by the change in the point at which this solus speech is introduced. The line, 'But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading' immediately precedes his entry, when, supposing himself to be unobserved, he gives utterance to the musings of his mind. See also Q1. It is thus manifest that the poet's intention was that these should be meditations of Hamlet on something which he found written in a book which he holds in his hand, a book which spoke of the evils of life, of death, their cure, of futurity, of the question of being or not being when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, and that what he says arises out of the argument in the book before him, and is not to be regarded as thoughts springing up in his own mind. [See note, line 60.] 'To be, or not to be: ay, there's the point,' as it is in the Quarto, is equivalent to, 'You, the author, are discussing the question of what shall be hereafter; you have a great and mighty subject in hand.' And the words as we now have them, 'To be, or not to be,—that is the question,' are much the same, if we regard, as we may, 'question' as equivalent to theme, argument, or subject. [There is also an analysis of this soliloquy to be found in Goldsmith's Works (vol. iii, p. 316, London, 1854), which attempts to prove that it is 'a heap of absurdities, whether we consider the situation, the sentiment, the argumentation, or the poetry.' This essay and five others have been included in Goldsmith's works on the strength of their having appeared in The British Magazine during the years 1761, 1762, and 1763, but no one, I think, can read them, certainly the one in question, without agreeing with the editor of the edition, Peter Cunningham, 'that they are not by Goldsmith.' The needless attempt, however, has been made gravely to refute this essay in Hackett's Notes and Comments on Shakespeare, New York, 1863, pp. 13-59. For German criticisms on this soliloquy, see Ziegler, TIECK, Rohrbach, ROmeun (footnote), in the Appendix, Vol. II.]"

        "Pope: a sea of] Perhaps siege, which continues the metaphor of 'slings,' 'arrows,' 'taking arms,' and represents the being encompassed on all sides with troubles. Theobald: Or one might emend nearer the traces of the text: 'th' assay of troubles' [Singer has no doubt that this was the word], or 'a 'say of troubles,' i.e. the attempts, attacks, &c. But perhaps any change is unnecessary, considering Shakespeare's freedom in combining metaphors, and that a 'sea' is used to signify a vast quantity, multitude, or confluence of anything. The prophet Jeremiah, in chap. li, 42, calls a prodigious army, a sea. Æschylus is frequent in the use of this metaphor: Septem contra Thebas [lines 64 and 114, ed. Dindorf]. Besides, a 'sea of troubles' among the Greeks grew into proverbial usage: κακῶν θάλασσα. So that the phrase means the troubles of human life, which flow in upon us, and encompass us round, like a sea. Hanmer: Assailing would preserve the propriety of the metaphor. Johnson: Shakespeare breaks his metaphors often, and in this desultory speech there was less need of preserving them. Caldecott: This mode of speaking is proverbial, and has been so in all ages and in all languages; neither can any metaphor be conceived more apt than that of the sea, to convey the idea of an overwhelming mass. With the closest analogy we say, a flood of transport, a torrent of abuse, a peck of troubles. Shakespeare uses it everywhere and in every form; and the integrity of his metaphor is that which he least thinks of. Garrick (Oration in Honor of Shakespeare's jubilee): Shakespeare's terms rather than his sentences are metaphorical; he calls an endless multitude a sea, by a happy allusion to the perpetual succession of wave on wave; and he immediately expresses opposition by 'taking up arms,' which, being fit in itself, he was not solicitous to accommodate to his first image. This is the language in which a figurative and rapid conception will always be expressed. A. E. B[rae] (N. & Qu. vol. vi, 23 Oct. 1852): To take arms against a sea neither presents an intelligible idea in itself, nor assists in carrying on the general allusion to offensive and defensive warfare. 'Slings' and 'arrows' are figurative of armed aggression, against which to have recourse to arms in opposition is a natural sequence of idea; but if these arms are to be directed against a sea of troubles, the sequence is broken, and the whole allusion becomes obscure and uncertain. But the whole image is that of a posse of evils thronging to assail us in this life,—a mortal coil, as it is afterwards called, in opposition to the immortal coil after death of ills we know not of,—this attack we may put an end to, or 'shuffle off,' by taking arms against it, scilicet, 'a bare bodkin!' Thus the very necessity of the context plainly exacts some word expressive of tumultuous attack; and such a word we obtain, bearing precisely that meaning, by the slight alteration of 'a sea' into assay. It is singular that lexicographers, amongst the several definitions they have ascribed to it, should have failed to include that one peculiar meaning,—charge or onset,—which renders it so appropriate. See II, ii, 71. But by Spenser the word is most frequently used, and its meaning most plainly indicated. See Faerie Queene, V, ii; V, xi. As to the probability of substitution, an equally close approximation exists between assay and 'a sea' as between asters and 'as stars;' nor is it at all certain that even in sound the vowels a and e were so distinctive in those days as in our own. The probability is still greater if it were spelt, as was often the case, with one s. Assay has all the meaning of Pope's conjecture, with the added sense, peculiar to itself, of thronging or simultaneous onset. Thus, too, in III, iii, 69, 'make assay' receives great force and beauty if interpreted, 'throng to the rescue.' [Although A. E. B. was anticipated by Theobald, yet his defence is so vigorous that I have not scrupled to insert it; it is doubtful whether his definition will apply to II, i, 65. Ed.] Bailey (i, 28) maintains that Shakespeare never could have written anything so inconsequent as lines 59 and 60: 'Hamlet proposes to himself the question whether he shall or shall not continue to live; but in proceeding to amplify it he performs the operation which is called changing a child at nurse, i.e. he substitutes a totally different question—namely, whether he shall continue to bear his wrongs patiently, or shall fight against them and put them down? It is as if my neighbor Lepidus, whilst deliberating whether he should remain in his present house or quit it, were to say: \"To remain or to quit? That is the question; whether it is better for me to continue to endure rattling windows, &c, or to call in the carpenter, and so put an end to these annoyances.\"'—vol. ii, p. 305. Accordingly, Bailey believes that logic is vindicated, and the true text restored, by reading 'to take arms against the seat of troubles, And by a poniard, or by deposing, end them.' Or the line 'intrinsically, or considered by itself, might be restored by reading, \"to take arms against a host of troubles;\" although the principal fault of the passage would remain unaffected.'—p. 306. Staunton: As Shakespeare has already furnished us with 'a sea of joys,' 'a sea of glory,' 'a sea of conscience,' 'a sea of wax,' 'a sea of care,' any emendation is very questionable. Halliwell cites: 'Whatsoever it be (which hardly at the length can be depainted) that after a sea of troubles we enjoy in this life,' &c.—The Passenger of Benvenuto, 1612. Keightley (who inclines to Pope's conjecture) says that this is almost a solitary instance of the figurative use of 'sea' by Shakespeare. Hackett (p. 51): The 'sea' here is the heart,—the fountain of existence, and it is compared in its agitated condition to a 'sea of troubles.' 'The analogy between the sea, with its ebb and flow, through rivers, channels, and creeks, and the heart, by whose impulse the blood courses through the veins and arteries, must be obvious to every one upon reflection.' Shakespeare frequently compares the heart to a 'sea.' Ingleby (Sh. Hermeneutics, p. 88): One consideration of the highest importance has been entirely ignored. When Hamlet talked of ending his sea of troubles, or, as he afterwards describes it, shuffling off his mortal coil, he had a covert consciousness, a conscience, in fact, which stayed the hand he would have raised against his own life; viz. that this so-called ending and shuffling off was a mere delusion, just as much so as repelling the advancing waves of the sea with shield and spear. Is not the metaphor then sound and whole? If there be an incongruity in the notion of taking arms, offensively or defensively, against the sea, is there not just as great an incongruity in using a bare bodkin against the soul,—the immortal part which (as Raleigh has it) 'no stab can kill'? [In proof that the metaphor in question is consistent, and has all the external evidences of authenticity, Ingleby cites a passage from Ritson's Memoirs of the Celts (p. 118), which is itself a translation of one in Ælian, to the effect that the Celts in the wantonness of their bravery 'oppose the overwhelming sea,' and 'taking arms rush upon the waves,' 'in like manner as if they were able to terrify or wound them.']"

Hunter (ii, 243): This seems to be the book which Shakespeare placed in the hands of Hamlet, and the following passages seem to approach so near to the thought of this soliloquy that we cannot doubt that they were in Shakespeare's mind when he put this speech into the mouth of Hamlet: 'How much were it better to follow the counsel of Agathius, who right well commended death, saying, that it did not only remove sickness and all other grief, but also, when all other discommodities of life did happen to man often, it never would come more than once. Seeing, therefore, with such ease men die, what should we account of death to be resembled to anything better than sleep? Moste assured it is that such sleeps are most sweet as be most sound, for those are the best where in like unto dead men we dream nothing. The broken sleeps, the slumber, and dreams full of visions, are commonly in them that have weak and sickly bodies.'—Book ii. Clarendon: These resemblances to Cardan are not very striking."

        "Warburton: coil] Tumult, bustle. Heath: The incumbrance of this mortal body. Steevens: Compare A Dolfull Discours of Two Strangers, &c., published by Churchyard, among his Chippes, 1575: 'Yea, shaking off this sinfull soyle Me thincke in cloudes I see,' &c. M. Mason (p. 383) agrees with Heath in referring this to the body, this 'covering of flesh,' and is persuaded that we should read 'mortal spoil' which is the same word as the slough which the snake casts every year. In sense it means the same as 'the case of flesh,' in Bonduca [IV, iv, p. 82, Beau. & Fl. Works, ed. Dyce]; and again, 'a separation Betwixt this spirit and the case of flesh.'—The Elder Brother [IV, iii, p. 262, Beau. & Fl. Works, ed. Dyce]; but the most complete parallel is 'this muddy vesture of decay.'—Mer. of Ven. V, i, 64. Caldecott: It is here used in each of its senses: turmoil, or bustle, and that which entwines or wraps round. Snakes generally lie like the coils of ropes; and, it is conceived, that an allusion is here had to the struggle which that animal is obliged to make in casting his slough. Hunter (ii, 240): He was thinking of the coil of a rope. With this expression 'shuffled off' better coheres. Singer: It is remarkable that under garbuglio, which corresponds in Italian to our 'coil,' Florio has 'a pecke of troubles,' of which Shakespeare's 'sea of troubles' may be only an aggrandised idea. Elze: With what reason can turmoil or noise be termed mortal? And how can we shuffle off a mortal noise? We are convinced that under 'coil' is concealed an error which we can remedy by an almost imperceptible change, if instead of 'coil' we read vail. Vail means a covering, an integument, and our body is the mortal covering or integument which we must shuffle off in order to enter on the life beyond. In Botany vail is the envelope, the chalypter of mosses, which enfolds the fructifying organs and which is burst by them, and it is not impossible that it was used generally for the envelope of buds. We do not venture to assert that Shakespeare knew this meaning of the word, but we know with what keen looks he must have examined nature. Beyond a doubt, clay would be better, but it would harmonise less with the received text. Elze (Shakespeare-Jahrbuch, vol. ii, p. 362) advocates the substitution of soil for 'coil,' which word he found in the Dolfull Discours, quoted by Steevens. Elze supports his conjecture very ably, but it is needless. 'Shuffle' decides; a coil may be said to be shuffled off, but soil would be shaken off. Hudson: As Wordsworth has it: 'the fretful stir unprofitable, and the fever of the world.' In N. & Qu. 23 Feb. '56, Ingleby started the question of how far the popular interpretation of 'coil,' as the body, is justified; the discussion was continued by 'X.' on the 15 March following, who maintained that in every instance where the word is used by Shakespeare it means turmoil, tumult; and in a second communication to the same journal on the 11th Oct., the same correspondent pertinently asks whether the contrast be not intended between 'coil' and 'quietus.' Ingleby replied (8 Nov. '56) that the interpretation of body for 'coil' was a popular error, not his, and that it perhaps arose, as suggested to him by a correspondent, from a confusion on the part of the public between the present passage and Colossians, iii, 9, with a reference also to 2 Corinthians, v, 1-5. H. T. Riley (8 Nov. '56, also) has no doubt that 'coil' refers to the body, and that it was probably suggested by Romans, vii, 24. The coil received its quietus on 18 Sept. '58, by 'A. M. of Greenock,' who cites a derivation of the word from the Gaelic cochul, meaning the scaly integument which clothes the lower limbs of a mermaid [!]. Ingleby, however, in his excellent Sh. Hermeneutics (p. 88, footnote), says that the analogies are too strong in favor of the 'mortal coil' being what Fletcher, in Bonduca, calls the 'case of flesh.' [Caldecott's interpretation, that 'coil' is used in both senses, seems to me the true one. Ed.]"

        "Warburton: time] The evils complained of are not the product of time or duration only, but of a corrupted age or manners. We may be sure that Shakespeare wrote 'of th' time.' Johnson: 'Whips' and 'scorns' have no great connection with one another, or with time. Though at all times scorn may be endured, the times that put men ordinarily in danger of whips are very rare. If 'whips' be retained, read: 'whips and scorns of tyrants.' But I think that quip [anticipated by Grey (ii, 295). Ed.], a sneer, a sarcasm, is the proper word. I propose, but not confidently, 'the quips and scorns of title.' [These conjectures of Johnson's were omitted in the Variorum of 1793 and subsequent ones. Ed.] Steevens: I think we might venture to read, 'whips and scorns o' the times?' i.e. times satirical as the age of Shakespeare, which probably furnished him with the idea. Hunter (ii, 240): 'Time' is used by early writers as equivalent to the modern expression, The Times. Taylor the Water Poet has: 'mock'd in rhyme, And made the only scornful theme of Time' Shakespeare himself seems to use time in the same manner in Rich. III: IV, iv, 106.

After all, this passage is merely one of the numberless puzzles in the text of Shakespeare; scarcely is the ink dry which has marked out a certain reading before reason and probability seem to shift to the side of the rejected reading; and to avoid unending vacillation an editor must fall back on the safe and sound rule: durior lectio praeferenda est; which applies here.

Farmer: This has been cavilled at by Lord Orrery and others, but without reason. The idea of a traveller in Shakespeare's time was of a person who gave an account of his adventures. Steevens: Compare, 'Qui nunc it per iter tenebricosum, Illuc unde negant redire quenquam.'—Catullus. Douce: No translation of Catullus into English is known to have been made. Both writers may have casually adopted the same sentiment. Malone (anticipated, however, by Gentleman, in the Dramatic Censor, i, 23, 1770) asserts that Shakespeare meant that from the unknown regions of the dead no traveller returns with all his corporeal powers, such as he who goes on a voyage of discovery brings back. The Ghost being 'invulnerable as the air,' was consequently incorporeal. Schlegel (Lectures, &c. ii, 196, footnote): Shakespeare wished purposely to show that Hamlet could not fix himself in any conviction of any kind whatever. Roffe (p. 31): According to that philosophy which the Spiritualist believes to have been Shakespeare's, Hamlet was perfectly correct in using this phraseology. Surely there is no skepticism in Hamlet, nor inadvertency in Shakespeare: a departed spirit appears to the spiritual eyes of the man, and not to his natural eyes; consequently does not, and cannot, overpass 'the bourn' which separates the spiritual and causal world from the natural and effect world. Coleridge silences the question forever: 'If it be necessary to remove the apparent contradiction,—if it be not rather a great beauty,—surely it were easy to say that no traveller returns to this world, as to his home or abiding-place.' Hartley Coleridge (Essays and Marginalia, i, 170): I will not say that an apparition might not confirm the faith of an Hereafter, where it pre-existed, but where that faith was not, or was neutralised by an inward misery, implicated with the very sense of being, its effect would be but momentary or occasional,—a source of perplexity, not of conviction,—throwing doubt at once on the conclusions of the understanding and the testimony of the senses, and fading itself into the twilight of uncertainty, making existence the mere shadow of a shade."

        "Marshall (p. 28): There, my lord] At this point, just as Ophelia is going to force back on Hamlet the sweet remembrances of his love, the fussy old Polonius, who has been fidgeting behind the arras, anxious to see the result of his most notable device, pops his head out, and in so doing drops his chamberlain's staff. Hamlet hears the noise, and instantly suspects the truth, that he is being made the object of an artfully devised scheme to entrap him into some confession of his secret."

        "Richardson [Essays, &c, fifth ed., 1797, p. 102): Hamlet's air and manner here should not be perfectly grave and serious. Nor is there anything in this dialogue to justify the tragic tone with which it is frequently spoken. Let Hamlet be represented as delivering himself in a light, airy, unconcerned, and thoughtless manner, and the rudeness, so much complained of, will disappear. Coleridge: Here it is evident that the penetrating Hamlet perceives, from the strange and forced manner of Ophelia, that the sweet girl was not acting a part of her own, but was a decoy; and his after-speeches are not so much directed to her as to the listeners and spies. Such a discovery in a mood so anxious and irritable accounts for a certain harshness in him;—and yet a wild upworking of love, sporting with opposites in a wilful self-tormenting strain of irony, is perceptible throughout. 'I did love you once;'—'I lov'd you not;'—and particularly in his enumeration of the faults of the sex from which Ophelia is so free, that the mere freedom therefrom constitutes her character. Note Shakespeare's charm of composing the female character by the absence of characters, that is, marks and out-jottings. Lamb (iii, 95, ed. 1870): All the Hamlets that I have ever seen, rant and rave at Ophelia as if she had committed some great crime, and the audience are highly pleased, because the words of the part are satirical, and they are enforced by the strongest expression of satirical indignation of which the face and voice are capable. But then, whether Hamlet is likely to have put on such brutal appearances to a lady whom he loved so dearly, is never thought on. The truth is, that in all such deep affections as had subsisted between Hamlet and Ophelia there is a stock of supererogatory love (if I may venture to use the expression), which in any great grief of heart, especially where that which preys upon the mind cannot be communicated, confers a kind of indulgence upon the grieved party to express itself, even to its heart's dearest object, in the language of a temporary alienation; but it is not alienation, it is purely a distraction, and so it always makes itself to be felt by that object; it is not anger, but grief assuming the appearance of anger,—love awkwardly counterfeiting hate, as sweet countenances when they try to frown; but such sternness and fierce disgust as Hamlet is made to show is no counterfeit, but the real face of absolute aversion,—of irreconcilable alienation. It may be said he puts on the madman; but then he should only so far put on this counterfeit lunacy as his own real distraction will give him leave; that is, incompletely, imperfectly; not in that confirmed, practised way, like a master of his art, or, as Dame Quickly would say, 'like one of those harlotry players.' Hazlitt (p. 110): Hamlet's conduct to Ophelia is quite natural in his circumstances. It is that of assumed severity only. It is the effect of disappointed hope, of bitter regrets, of affection suspended, not obliterated, by the distraction of the scene around him! Amidst the natural and preternatural horrors of his situation, he might be excused in delicacy from carrying on a regular courtship. When his 'father's spirit was in arms,' it was not the time for the son to make love in. He could neither marry Ophelia, nor wound her mind by explaining the cause of his alienation, which he durst hardly trust himself to think of. It would have taken him years to come to a direct explanation on the point. In the harassed state of his mind he could, not have done otherwise than he did. His conduct does not contradict what he says of his love for her when he sees her grave. Vischer (Krit. Gauge, p. 102) conjectures that Hamlet suspects that the Queen is eavesdropping, and that what he says here is aimed at her.",
        "STAUNTON: honest] That 'honest' in this dialogue is equivalent to chaste or virtuous, it would be superfluous to mention, but that some critics, in their strictures on the conduct of Hamlet in the present scene, appear to have forgotten it. The beginning recalls to mind some passages in Shirley's, The Royal Master, IV, i: 'King. Are you honest? Theo. Honest! King. I could have used the name of chaste Or virgin; but they carry the same sense.' — [Works, vol. iv, p. 156, ed. Dyce.] Clarendon: See Winter's Tale II, i, 68 and 76."

The lady, 'tis true, interprets the words otherwise, giving them the turn that best suited her purpose. Singer: 'Honesty may be corrupted by flattering discourse addressed to beauty.' Hamlet remarks respecting women generally. Clarendon: Hamlet says that honesty or virtue, personified as the guardian of beauty, should allow none, not even himself, to discourse with the latter."

The resentment of neglected love may inflame his dazzling satire, but under the circumstance, 'Get thee to a nunnery' was the best and only advice he could give her. A nunnery was her best and only refuge from the impending storm. Destruction for himself and all else around him; but for her the cloister's timely shelter. There is no telling when the fierce wrath may seize him; when he may shake down the pillars of that guilty palace. But not, if he can help it, on her fair head shall the ruin fall! Since the grave is opening for him, let the convent open for her. Not his, but never another's! O wonderful poet!

Marshall (A Study of Hamlet, p. 28): Hamlet, before condemning Ophelia as an accomplice in the contemptible trick of spying on him, wishes to put her to the plain proof; he therefore turns round and holds out his hand towards her; she, forgetting her part, and thinking, poor girl, that he is going to take her to his breast and forgive her, flies across to him; he checks her with his outstretched hand, and, holding hers, looks straight into her eyes, as only one who loves her has a right to look into a maiden's eyes, and solemnly asks her the question: 'Where is your father?'

Steevens : The text means : to represent the manners of the time suitable to the period that is treated of, according as it may be ancient or modern. M. Mason : Read, « every age and body of the time,' and then the sense will be : * show virtue her own likeness, and every stage of life, every profession or body of men, its form and resemblance.' Malone : Perhaps Sh. did not mean to connect these words. It is the end of playing, says Hamlet, to show the age in which we live, and the body of the time, its form and pressure ; to delineate exactly the manners of the age, and the particular humor of the day. Keightley {Exp. 292) : We might feel inclined to read world for 'time,' but no change is required. Bailey (ii, 8) :. Read visage, which is so near * very age * in the ductus literarum.

Silberschlag {Morgenblatt, No. 47, i860, p. 1 1 14): This is essentially the same definition of the drama which Cervantes in Don Quixote puts into the mouth of the Priest : ' Comedy,' he says, ' according to the opinion of Cicero, should be a mirror of human life, a model of manners, a representation of truth.' Both Sh. and Cervantes clearly drew their definitions from Cicero ; Cervantes says so expressly, while Sh. intimates in the phrase, ' both at the first and now,' that he gave an ancient definition of the drama, but he does not mention Cicero's name, because it was not his style, in the works of his riper years, to display his knowledge, or to support his opinions, by the citation of authorities. His use of 'hie et ubique,' in I, v, 156, affords a proof [noted ad loc] that the end of that scene was written many years earlier than the rest of the drama."

Thomas Wilson, for a quick delicate refined extemporall witte ; and Richard Tarleton, for a wondrous plentifull, pleasant extemporall witty &c. Again, in Tarleton's Newes from Purgatory : '   1 absented myself from all plaies, as wanting that merrye Roscius of plaiers that famosed all comedies so with his pleasant and extemporall invention? This cause for complaint, however, against low comedians is still more ancient; for in The Contention Betwyxte Churchyard and Cornell, &c, 1560, I find the following passage: ‘But Vices in stage plaies, When theyr matter is gon, They laugh out the reste To the lookers on,’ &c. Malone : The clown very often addressed the audience in the middle of the play, and entered into a contest of raillery and sarcasm with such of the audience as chose to engage with him. Hunter (ii, 246) : There is a remarkable addition at this place in Qx, which is not without marks of the hand of Sh. The phrases there found continued to be the stock-wit of the clowns who appeared on the stage of the mountebanks, and who seem silently to have withdrawn themselves about the close of the last century. Collier (ed. 2) : The passage in Qx, which is mere prose, although chopped up into apparent verse, is curious, because it seems levelled at William Kemp, who about this date quitted the company of players to which Sh. had always belonged. Perhaps, after Kemp rejoined the King's Players (before 1605), the passage was omitted or subdued. We are to bear in mind that Hamlet was probably not composed until the winter of 1601, or the spring of 1602, and it was about this date, . . . that Kemp went over from the Lord Chamberlain's to Lord Nottingham's Players, and of course did his best to promote the success of a competing association. It would, therefore, not be surprising if, besides laying down a general axiom as to the abuse introduced by the performers of the parts of clowns, Sh. had designed a particular allusion to Kemp. White: The passage in Qx was probably an extemporaneous addition to the text by the actor, and had but a passing application. Halliwell is inclined to think that this addition in Qr should be retained in the text."

Let any one, who doubts for a moment whether Sh. intended that Ham. should merely feign madness, read carefully over the present speech, marking its sobriety of expression even amid all its ardor, its singleness and purity of sentiment amid its most forcible utterance, and then decide whether it could be possible that he should mean Hamlet's wits to be touched.

Hamlet's meaning is, I would have thee so enter into my feelings, so identify thyself with me, that when thou seest that act a-foot, even with the very comment of my soul, thou wilt observe my uncle. *My* also gives force to * Even with the very,* whith has less force in the other reading.

        "Coleridge: university] Coleridge : To have kept Hamlet's love for Ophelia before the audience in any direct form, would have made a breach in the unity of interest; — but yet to the thoughtful reader it is suggested by his spite to poor Polonius, whom he can not let rest. Farmer infers that the common players were occasionally admitted to perform in the universities on the strength of an application for that purpose in Vice Chancellor Hatcher's Letters to Lord Burghley, 1580. But Calde- cott thinks this extract merely shows that applications of this sort were occasionally made ; not that they were accepted; on the contrary, the governors were always dis- posed to find reasons for rejecting them. Wherefore, in the absence of direct evi- dence, Caldecott thinks that the probability of stage plays having been performed in the universities by professed actors is strongly negatived. That he was mistaken will be seen from the reference to Qx by Clarendon. Malone: The practice of acting Latin plays in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge is very ancient, and continued to near the middle of the last century. They were performed occasionally for the entertainment of princes and other great personages; and regularly at Christ- mas, at which time a Lord of Misrule was appointed at Oxford, to regulate the exhibitions, and a similar officer with the title of Imperator at Cambridge. The most celebrated actors at Cambridge were the students of St John's and King's colleges: at Oxford those of Christ- Church. In the hall of that college a Latin comedy called Marcus Geminus, and the Latin tragedy of Progne, were performed before Queen Elizabeth in the year 1566 ; and in 1564, the Latin tragedy of Dido was played before Her Majesty, when she visited the university of Cambridge. Clarendon: In 1564, on Sunday evening, Aug. 6, Queen Elizabeth saw the Aulularia of Plautus in the antechapel of King's College Chapel. On the occasion of the visit of James I and Prince Charles to Cambridge in 16 14 plays were performed in the Hall of Trinity College ; among them the comedies of Ignoramus and Albumazar, which have escaped oblivion. On the title-page of Qx it is said, 'As it hath beene diuerse times acted by his Highnesse seruants in the Cittie of London : as also in the two Vniver- sities of Cambridge and Oxford, and else-where.'"

'This world is not for aye,' the thoughts upon the fluctuations of 'love' and 'fortune,' and the final reflection upon the contrary current of 'our 'wills and fates,' with the overthrow of our 'devices,' and the ultimate diversity between our intentions and their 'ends,' are as if proceeding from the Prince himself. His motive in writing these additional lines for insertion, and getting the player to deliver them, we take to be a desire that they shall serve to divert attention from the special passages directed at the King, and to make these latter seem less pointed. We have fancied that this is Shakespeare's intention, because of the emphatic variation in the style just here. Observe how very different are the mythological allusions to 'Phoebus,' 'Neptune,' &c, and the stiff inversions of 'about the world have times twelve thirties been,' 'discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must,' &c.; and, moreover, observe how exactly the couplet commencing the Player-King's speech, 'I do believe,' &c, and the couplet concluding it, 'So think thou wilt,' &c., would conjoin were the intervening lines omitted. Tschischwitz finds in lines 194–199 an allusion to Ros. and Guild; see II, ii, 346–349.",

        "Dyce: recorders] The change from the plural of the Qq to the singular of the Ff I have not the slightest doubt we must attribute to the 'company,' who were obliged to be economical both of persons and properties. A single recorder, indeed, suffices for the mere business of this scene; but the alteration is quite at variance with what precedes in line 280.",
        "Chappell: recorders] Old English musical instruments were commonly made of three or four different sizes, so that a player might take any of the four parts that were required to fill up the harmony. So Violins, Lutes, Recorders, Flutes, Shawms, &c, have been described by some writers in a manner which (to those unacquainted with this peculiarity) has appeared irreconcilable with other accounts. Sh. (in Hamlet) speaks of the Recorder as a little pipe, and says, in Mid. N. D., ‘he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder;’ but in an engraving of the instrument* it reaches from the lip to the knee of the performer; and among those left by Henry VIII were Recorders of box, oak, and ivory, great and small, two base Recorders of walnut, and one great base Recorder. Recorders and (English) Flutes are to outward appearance the same, although Lord Bacon in his Naturat History, cent. iii, sec. 221, says the Recorder hath a less bore, and a greater above and below. The number of holes for the fingers is the same, and the scale, the compass, and the manner of playing, the same. Salter describes the recorder, from which the instrument derives its name, as situate in the upper part of it, i.e. between the hole below the mouth and the highest hole for the finger. He says, 'Of the kinds of music, vocal has always had the preference in esteem, and in consequence the Recorder, as approaching nearest to the sweet delightfulness of the voice, ought to have first place in opinion, as we see by the universal use of it confirmed.' Ward, the military instrument-maker, informs me that he has seen 'old English flutes' with a hole bored through the side, in the upper part of the instrument, covered with a thin piece of skin, like gold-beater's skin. I suppose this would give somewhat the effect of the quill or reed in the Hautboy, and that these were Recorders. Recorders were used for teaching birds to pipe.",

'To withdraw with you?' (says he). 'Is that your meaning?' But finding his friends continue to move mysteriously about him, he adds, with some resentment, a question more easily intelligible.",
        "Caldecott: To withdraw with you] The two royal emissaries at first only request that the Prince would 'vouchsafe them a word;' and they then acquaint him with the King's rage, and the Queen's command to visit her. They then, by a waving of the hand, or some such signal, as the exclamation of Ham. denotes, intimate that he should remove to a more retired quarter. Although aware that the above, their only proper business, could not require any private communication, he at first, in gentle expostulation, reproaches them; but presently recollecting their insidious aims, and feeling at the same time, as an indignity, the freedom taken in thus beckoning him to withdraw, he in a moment assumes a different tone; and, with the most galling sneer and interrogatory, heaps upon them the utmost contempt and contumely.",
        "Singer: To withdraw with you] It means no more than 'to draw back with you,' to leave that scent or trail. It is a hunting term, like that which follows.",
        "Staunton: To withdraw with you] It is simply a direction addressed to the Players who bring in the recorders, and the true reading: 'So, — [taking a recorder] withdraw with you.' What subsequently transpires between Ham. and his schoolfellows could hardly have taken place in presence of the Players, and the disputed words may have been intended to mark the departure of the latter.",

If alteration be necessary, I should suppose Sh. wrote 'the bitterest day.'",

        "Scholar Name: rose] It is only by keeping steadfastly in mind the many benefits which we have received at the hands of the early commentators that we can listen with any patience to their dispute about the meaning of this phrase. Warburton thinks it refers to an actual flower worn on the side of the face. Steevens accepts the flower but denies the ‘side of the face,’ because the text reads ‘forehead;’ it cannot mean a blush, ‘because the forehead is no proper place for a blush to be displayed in.’ It must be a rose on the forehead, and in proof a figure, in a painted glass window representing a Morrice-Dance, is cited that bears a flower on the forehead! (I hope here be truths!) It makes very little matter that this flower turns out to be a Deptford Pink; the flower is there, and the rose in Hamlet follows as of course. Malone is rather overpowered by this display of learning, but ventures to suggest that rose might ‘only mean the roseate hue.’ And then, as if frightened at his own boldness, hastens to add that ‘the forehead certainly appears to us an odd place for the hue of innocence to dwell on;’ and yet Sh. has represented a smile there, as in Tro. & Cres. II, ii, 205, and moreover, ‘that part of the forehead which is situated between the eyebrows seems to have been considered by our poet as the seat of innocence and modesty,’ as in IV, v, 119. Boswell closes the discussion forever by saying that ‘“rose” is put generally for the ornament, the grace, of an innocent love.’ CALDECOTT refers to the proverb frequent in Sh., and found in The London Prodigal, 1605: ‘As true as the skin between any man's brows.’ And, lastly, SINGER refers to Ophelia's description of Ham. as ‘the rose of the fair state.’"

        "Scholar Name: picture] Davies (Dram. Misc., Dublin, 1784, vol. iii, p. 63): It has been the constant practice of the stage, since the Restoration, for Ham. to produce from his pocket two pictures in little of his father and uncle, not much bigger than large coins or medallions. Instead of movable scenery, which was first introduced from France by Betterton in 1662, Shakespeare's stage made use of tapestry. Two full-length portraits in the tapestry of the Queen's closet might be of service in this scene. Steevens: It is evident from the words, ‘A station,’ &c., that these pictures, which are introduced as miniatures on the stage, were meant for whole lengths, being part of the furniture of the Queen's closet. Ham., who in a former scene had censured those who gave ‘forty, fifty ducats apiece’ for his uncle's ‘picture in little,’ would hardly have condescended to carry such a thing in his pocket. Malone: The introduction of miniatures in this place appears to be a modern innovation. A print prefixed to Rowe's edition of Hamlet, 1709, proves this. There the two royal portraits are exhibited as half-lengths, hanging in the Queen's closet; and either thus, or as whole-lengths, they were probably exhibited from the time of the original performance to the death of Betterton. To half-lengths, however, the same objection lies as to miniatures. Steevens: We may also learn that from this print the trick of kicking the chair down on the appearance of the Ghost was adopted by modern Hamlets from the practice of their predecessors. Caldecott objects to miniatures, because the audience could not then be permitted to judge of what they hear, nor make any estimate of the comparative excellence of the features, nor could the ‘station’ and the ‘combination and the form’ be adequately represented in so confined a space. Completely to do away with the objection that it is not probable that Ham. should have about him his uncle's picture, a Bath actor once suggested the snatching of it from his mother's neck. Hunter (ii, 256): Perhaps Holman's way was the best. The picture of the then King hung up in the lady's closet, but the miniature of the king who was dead was produced by Ham. from his bosom. [Fitzgerald (Life of Garrick, ii, 65) suggests that the pictures be seen with the mind's eye only; a suggestion adopted by Irving and Salvini. Fechter follows the suggestion of the Bath actor mentioned by Caldecott, and tears the miniature from his mother's neck and casts it away. Rossi not only tears it from his mother's neck, but dashes it to the ground and stamps on the fragments. Edwin Booth makes use of two miniatures, taking one from his own neck, and the other from his mother's. — A. I. Fish.]"

Steevens: Whichsoever of the readings be the true one, the poet was not indebted to this boasted philosophy [referred to by Warburton] for his choice. MALONE: ‘Sense’ has been already used for sensation in line 38, above. Staunton: The meaning is: ‘Sense (i. e. the sensibility to appreciate the distinction between external objects) you must have, or you would no longer feel the impulse of desire.’ This signification of ‘motion’ might be illustrated by numerous examples from our early writers, but the accompanying out of Sh. will suffice: Meas. for Meas.

        "Marsh: grained] Marsh (Lectures on the English Language, New York, 1859, p. 67, et seq.): Granum, in Latin, signifies a seed or kernel, and it was early applied to all small objects resembling seeds, and finally to all minute particles. Hence it was applied to the round, seed-like form of the dried body, or rather ovarium, of an insect of the genus coccus, which furnished a variety of red dyes. Granum becomes grana in Spanish, graine in French, and grain in English, meaning a dye produced by the coccus insect, often called in commerce kermes. The color obtained from kermes or grain was peculiarly durable. When, then, a merchant recommended his purple stuffs as being dyed in grain, he originally meant that they were dyed with kermes, and would wear well; and this phrase was afterwards applied to other colors, as a mode of expressing the quality of durability. See Com. of Err. III, ii, 108; and Twelfth Night, I, v, 256. In both these examples [as also in the present instance from Hamlet] it is the sense of permanence (a well-known quality of the purple produced by the grain or kermes) that is expressed. It is familiarly known that if wool be dyed before spinning, the color is usually more permanent than when the spun yarn or manufactured cloth is first dipped in the tincture. When the original sense of grain grew less familiar, and it was used chiefly as expressive of fastness of color, the name of the effect was transferred to an ordinary known cause, and dyed in grain, originally meaning dyed with kermes, then dyed with fast color, came at last to signify dyed in the wool or other raw material. Clarendon: Cotgrave has ‘Graine: . . . graine wherewith cloth is dyed in graine; Scarlet dye, Scarlet in graine.’"

Dyce]: ‘His lechery inseamed upon him.’ In The Book of Haukyng, bl. 1., n. d., we are told that ‘ensayme of a hauke is the grece.’ In Randle Holme’s Academy of Armory and Blazon, B.

White: The phrase is so gross that, were it not for Hamlet’s mood, we might willingly believe that incestuous of Q4Q5 is the true text.

        "Theobald: vice] Theobald was the first who noted that this means ‘that buffoon character which used to play the Fool in old Plays.’ In the Variorum notes to 2 Hen. IV: III, ii, 343, various fanciful etymologies of the word are given. Douce (i, 468) closes the discussion by showing that the character in the old moral-plays, known as the ‘Vice,’ was doubtless so named from the vicious qualities attributed to him, and from the mischievous nature of his general conduct. Collier [Hist. of Eng. Dram. Poetry, ii, 264, et sea.) gives the best account of this curious personage in a passage quoted by Dyce (Gloss.): As the Devil now and then appeared without the Vice, so the Vice sometimes appeared without the Devil. Malone tells us that ‘the principal employment of the Vice was to belabor the Devil;’ but, although he was frequently so engaged, he had higher duties. He figured now and then in the religious plays of a later date, and, in The Life and Repentance of Mary Magdalen, 1567, he performed the part of her lover, before her conversion, under the name of Infidelity; in King Darius, 1565, he also acted a prominent part, by his own impulses to mischief, under the name of Iniquity, without any prompting from the representative of the principle of evil. Such was the general style of the Vice, and as Iniquity he is spoken of by Sh. (Rich. III: III, i, 82) and Ben Jonson (Staple of News, second Intermean). The Vice and Iniquity seem, however, sometimes to have been distinct persons, and he was not unfrequently called by the name of particular vices; thus, in Lusty Juventus, the Vice performs the part of Hypocrisy: in Common Conditions he is called Conditions; in Like will to Like, he is named Nichol New-fangle; in The Trial of Treason his part is that of Inclination; in All for Money he is called Sin; in Tom Tyler and his Wife, Desire; and in Appius and Virginius, Haphazard. Though Douce is unquestionably correct when he states that the Vice ‘was generally dressed in a fool’s habit’ [hence the expression in Hamlet, ‘A king of shreds and patches.’ — Dyce], he did not by any means constantly wear the parti-colored habiliments of a fool; he was sometimes required to act a gallant, and now and then to assume the disguise of virtues it suited his purpose to personate. In The Trial of Treasure, 1567, he was not only provided, as was customary, with his wooden dagger, but, in order to render him more ridiculous, with a pair of spectacles (no doubt of a preposterous size) The Vice, like the Fool, was sometimes furnished with a dagger of lath, and it was not unusual that it should be gilt Tattle [in Jonson’s Staple of News] observes that ‘there is never a fiend to cany him [the Vice] away,’ and in the first Intermean of the same play Mirth leads us to suppose that it was a very common termination of the adventures of the Vice for him to be carried off to hell on the back of the Devil; ‘he would carry away the Vice on his back, quick to hell, in every play where he came.’ In The Longer thou livest the more Fool thou art, and in Like will to Like, the Vice is disposed of nearly in this summary manner: in the first, Confusion carries him to the Devil, and in the last, Lucifer bears him off to the infernal regions on his shoulders. In King Darius the Vice runs to hell of his own accord, to escape from Constancy, Equity, and Charity. According to Bishop Harsnet (in a passage cited by Malone, — Shakespeare, by Boswell, iii, 27), the Vice was in the habit of riding and beating the Devil, at other times than when he was carried against his will to punishment."

If, therefore, the Ghost did not wear a ‘nightgown,’ he was unarmed at the time of the old annotator.

        "Stratmann: live] Stratmann: Ltzve, of the Qq, seems to be the true reading 185, 186: [That monster, custom...] Theobald: ‘Habits devil’ arose from the supposed necessity of contrasting devil and angel. *Habits evil* I owe to the sagacity of Dr Thirlby. That is, custom, which, by inuring us to ill habits, makes us lose the apprehension of their being really ill, as easily will reconcile us to the practice of good actions. Theobald, in his correspondence with Warburton (Nichols's Illust. of Lit. ii, 574), says: ‘I would read and point “doth eat Of habits evil,” &c., i.e. of the evil of habit.’ [Herein he is followed by Singer (ed. 2) and White. Ed.] Johnson: I think Thirlby's conjecture wrong; angel and devil are evidently opposed. Malone: I incline to think with Dr Thirlby. Steevens: I would read: Or habit's devil. The poet first styles custom a monster, and may aggravate and amplify his description by adding, that it is the ‘daemon who presides over habit.’ — That monster custom, or habit's devil, is yet an angel in this particular. Boswell: ‘Habit's devil’ means a devil in his usual habits. Becket (i, 60) and Mitford (Gent. Maga. 1845) both conjectured ‘If habit's devil;’ the latter paraphrases: ‘If that monster, custom, which in general is the devil of habit, leading to evil, yet in this thing acts the good part of angel,’ &c. Caldecott: ‘That monster, custom, who devours all sense, all just and correct feeling, (being also) the evil genius of (our) propensities or habits, is, nevertheless, in this particular a good angel.’ It has been suggested that if a comma were placed after ‘habits’ the sense would be — ‘A monster or devil, who makes mankind insensible to the quality of actions which are habitual.’ Knight: The edd. who have made ‘habits’ the genitive case cannot explain their own reading. As we print the passage it means: custom, who destroys all nicety of feeling, — sense, — sensibility, — who is the devil that governs our habits, — is yet an angel in this, &c. Collier (ed. 1): Our punctuation means, ‘that monster, custom, who all sense doth eat Of habits devil, is still an angel in this,’ &c. Singer (ed. ii): The old copy indicates clearly the misprint, for the word is here devill, while just below and elsewhere it is uniformly divell when the evil spirit is meant. Delius (ed. i): The opposition between ‘angel’ and ‘devil’ shows that the latter as well as the former refers to ‘monster, custom:’ ‘devil,’ therefore, must be in apposition, separated, it is true, from the subject by the subordinate clause. Collier (ed. ii): We now adopt Thirlby's emendation, although it is very possible that an opposition between ‘devil’ and ‘angel’ was intended. Still, the passage is decidedly corrupt. White: The text of the Qq is clearly wrong. ‘Angel’ is opposed to ‘monster’ in the line above. The old text also nullifies the force of the important word ‘likewise,’ two lines below. Staunton: The trifling change we have taken the liberty to make, while doing little violence to the original, may be thought, it is hoped, to give at least as good a meaning as any other which has been proposed. Keightley: The verb ‘eate’ here could never have come from the poet's pen; for it makes pure nonsense. I read create with the greatest confidence, of which the first two letters must have been effaced in the poet's MS. We have an exact parallel in smelly ‘all,’ in Timon, I, ii, 132. ‘Sense’ seems here to signify kind, manner, way. [Keightley's text reads: ‘That monster, custom, who all sense doth create Of habits, devil is angel yet in this,’ &c., which is to me unintelligible. Ed.] Clarendon: The words as they stand yield a very intelligible sense and require no alteration. That monster, Custom, who destroys all natural feeling and prevents it from being exerted, and is the malignant attendant on habits, is yet angel in this respect, &c. The double meaning of the word ‘habits’ suggested the ‘frock or livery’ in l. 164. Moberly: This noble passage contains Shakespeare's philosophy of custom (έθος), in which, happier than some professed moralists, he sees that the function of habit is to work upward towards a formed resolution."

        "Malone: master] Malone: For the insertion of the word curb I am answerable. The printer or corrector of a late Quarto, finding the line nonsense, omitted the word either, and substituted master in its place. The modern editors have accepted the substituted word, and yet retain either; by which the metre is destroyed. The word omitted in the first copy was undoubtedly a monosyllable. Steevens: This very rational conjecture may be countenanced by the same expression in Mer. of Ven. IV, i, 217. Singer (ed. i) [reading ‘either quell,’ followed by Moberly]: The occurrence of curb in so opposite a sense just before is against Malone's emendation. Staunton: ‘Master,’ which, as it affords sense, though destructive to the metre, we retain, not, however, without acknowledging a preference for Malone's emendation. Walker, Vers. 75: Read ‘either master th' devil,’ &c. Moreover, ‘curb’ occurs fourteen lines before. — Crit. i, 308. Bailey (ii, 12): Ham. means to say that custom can either bring the devil into our natures, or throw him out. I therefore propose: ‘And either house the devil,’ which forms an appropriate counterpart to ‘throw him out.’ Forsyth proposed the same word in his Notes, &c, 102, and also in N. & Qu., 1 Dec. '66. Elze (Athenaum, 11 Aug. '66) proposes, ‘And either usher the devil,’ and thinks that the similarity of sound in the two consecutive words, ‘either usher,’ may have caused the compositor of Q1 to omit the latter. H. D. (Athenczum, 18 Aug. '66): Why not read, ‘To master the devil, and throw him out.’ Bolton Corney (N. & Qu., 8 Dec. '66): Read ‘And either aid the,’ &c. J. Wetherell (N. & Qu., 22 Dec. '66) believes that sound and sense are satisfied by ‘And hie there the devil;’ a speedy summons is hereby contrasted with a dismissal implied in ‘throw him out.’ Cartwright (New Readings, &c, p. 37): Read ‘And either lay the,’ &c. Nicholson (N. & Qu., 19 Dec. 1868): I propose, ‘And either throne,’ &c. Its alliteration explains its omission, and why ‘cast out,’ the wording of every version, was changed into ‘throw out.’ It restores to the line its musical tone. It gives the exact sense required. Persistence in well-doing, whether by doing good or by leaving evil undone, exorcises the Tempter with wondrous potency; but persistence in evil so destroys rebelling conscience, that the prince of this world unresistingly ascends our vacant throne, and makes of us willing and unrespective servants for his work. Lastly, it gives not only the exact sense, but the full sense, required by the context, whether above or below it. Clarendon: It seems more probable that something is omitted which is contrasted with ‘throw out,’ and this may have been ‘lay’ or ‘lodge.’ The latter was the technical word used in Harsnet's Declaration, c. 12. Moberly [reading ‘either quell’]: Either quell him once for all, or baffle his attacks whenever they arise. Ingleby [Sh. Hermeneutics, p. 125) records two emendations suggested to him by friends: Sylvester proposes, ‘either mask the devil,’ of which Q is the corruption. Compare III, i, 47-49. And C. J. Munro ‘half-seriously’ suggests: ‘And entertain the devil.’ ‘It is not easy to discover,’ says Ingleby, ‘why [the words suggested by Malone, Singer, and the rest] should find more favor than a score of others just as good.’ Curb suggests rein, rule, thrall, bind, chain, &c.; quell, lay, and couch suggest charm, worst, quench, foil, balk, cross, thwart, daunt, shame, cow, tame, &c.; while aid suggests fire, rouse, stir, serve, feed, &c. Besides which, there are many dissyllables that befit the sense and measure, as abate, abase, &c. And why not read ‘over-maister,’ which occurs in a former scene? Thus we see what a wealth of suggestion has been ignored! We venture to call attention to the evident requirements of the passage: ‘The stamp of nature’ is not new to us in this connection, nor in this play; we have had it twice in the second ghost-scene, viz. ‘the vicious mole of nature,’ and ‘the stamp of one defect.’ Now Hamlet would say, ‘Use almost can change, or convert, this stamp of nature;’ so that an antithesis is not only not required, but is impertinent. Use, he would say, can either subdue ‘habit’s devil’ by following out his own prescription of gradual weaning from evil, or (if the worst come to the worst, and revolution be necessary) cast him out; and either of these can such use, or change of habit, effect ‘with wondrous potency.’ The keynote of the whole passage is ‘Reformation, by gradually subduing evil habits;’ and so far from Hamlet's advice, ‘assume a virtue if you have it not,’ being a recommendation of hypocrisy, it is given solely with the view of facilitating inward amendment, and is therefore honest and sincere. The missing word, then, must at least import the subduing of the devil of habit. In the First Quarto we have the expression, ‘And win [i. e. wean] yourself by little as you may’ from the sin to which you [the Queen] have habituated yourself. Now, that weaning by little and little, or gradually weaning the will and affections from the customary sin, ‘recurring and suggesting still,’ is just what the missing word, were it recovered, would assuredly be found to express or imply. Lay and shame are equally acceptable in sense, and both afford a perfect rhythm. Perhaps shame is the finer reading of the two. At the same time it must be owned that Hamlet's prescription is calculated to do little for the sinner; at best, we fear, to ‘skin and film the rancorous place.’ We can hardly say that conjecture has yet determined the best reading here, though it cannot be said that sufficient indications are wanting for its guidance. Unfortunately, it is in the very nature of the case that some doubt should continue to vex this passage, after conjecture has done its work."

        "Staunton: guts] Steevens gives several examples (one from Lyly, ‘who made the first attempt to polish our language’) to show that anciently this word was not so offensive to delicacy as at present. Caldecott, while conceding this, nevertheless thinks that ‘there is a coarseness and want of feeling in this part of the conduct, if not in the language, of Hamlet, — an excuse for which we seek in vain at this time in the peculiarity or necessities of his situation;’ and he can account for it only by supposing that it must have been in compliance with the rude taste of the age. Halliwell: This is one of those words which the silly caprice of fashion has invested with an imaginary coarseness. I have seen a letter, written about a century ago, in which a lady of rank, addressing a gentleman, speaks of her guts with the same nonchalance with which we should now write stomach. STAUNTON: It was commonly used where we should employ entrails, and in this place really signifies no more than lack- brain or shallow-pate.",
        "Staunton: [Lugging out bodies] Staunton: A consideration of the exigencies of the theatre in Shakespeare's time, which not only obliged an actor to play two or more parts in the same drama, but to perform such servile offices as are now done by attendants of the stage, shows that this line is a mere interpolation to afford the player an excuse for removing the body. We append a few examples where the same expedient is adopted for the same purpose. Among them the notable instance of Sir John Falstaff carrying off the body of Harry Percy on his back, — an exploit as clumsy and unseemly as Hamlet's 'tugging out' Pol., and, like that, perpetuated on the modern stage only from sheer ignorance of the circumstances which originated such a practice: Rom. & Jul. III, i, 201; Rich. II: V, v, 118, 119; I Hen. IV: V, iv, 160; 1 Hen. VI: I, iv, 110; Ibid. II, v, 120, 121; Ibid. IV, vii, 91, 92; 2 Hen. VI: IV, i, 145; Ibid. IV, x, 86, 87; Ibid.

III, ii, 261; Ibid.V, v, 78, 79; Ant. & Cleo. IV, ix, 31, 32; Ibid. IV, xiv, 138. These instances from Sh. alone, and they could easily be multiplied, will suffice to bring into view one of the inconveniences to which the elder dramatists were subject through the paucity ot actors; and at the same time, by exhibiting the mode in which they endeavored to obviate the difficulty, may afford a key to many passages and incidents that before appeared anomalous."

But the question arises, To what purpose all this excitement and bustle? The scene appears to have been written for its own sake, not helping forward the story. Except that Pol. is accidentally killed in the course of it, the parties are left precisely where they were, Ham. having only in this forcible manner signified to his mother the displeasure which he felt at her conduct. But as the play was originally written this scene had a purpose. Ham. reveals to his mother his knowledge of his uncle's guilt, and his purpose of revenge; and she engages to conceal and to assist. From this time the Queen keeps up appearances with her husband, but is secretly a friend to Ham.; and there is an entire scene, afterwards withdrawn, between her and Hor., in which Hor. communicates to her confidentially the return of Ham. from England, when the dialogue ends with her saying: [see Appendix, p. 77, lines 1779-1781.] This removes all ambiguity respecting the part which the poet intended the Queen should take; according to the present regulation, her precise situation is not clearly exhibited."

        "Johnson: The ... body] Johnson: This answer I do not comprehend. Perhaps it should be, — The body is not with the King, for the King is not with the body. Jennens: The body, being in the palace, might be said to be with the King; though the King, not being in the same room with the body, was not with the body. Steevens: Perhaps this, — The body is in the King's house (i.e. the present King's), yet the King (i.e. he who should have been king) is not with the body. Intimating that the usurper is here, the true King in a better place. Or it may mean — the guilt of the murder lies with the King, but the King is not where the body lies. Douce: The body, i. e. the external appearance or person of the monarch, is with his uncle; but that the real and lawful king is not in that body. Caldecott: The King is not yet cut off from life and sovereignty : his carcase remains to the King; but the King is not with the body or carcase that you seek; the King is not with Polonius. But Hamlet's answers are necessarily enigmatical. A more natural meaning is suggested: The image raised, the impression made upon the King's fears by the fate of Polonius, makes his body or carcase present to the fancy of the King, who knew and has said that ' it had been so with him had he been there;' but the King is not with the body, i. e. is not lying with Polonius. Others interpret, plainly enough, if admissibly : The body is with the King, i. e. intombed, or in the other world with the late, the real king; but the King, i. e. he who now wears the crown, the usurper, is not with the body. Singer: It may mean : The King is a body without a kingly soul, a thing — of nothing. Elze agrees with Eschenburg's explanation : The corpse is here with the King, but the King is not with it, i. e. he is as yet no corpse. Hudson: The meaning of this intended riddle, to the best of my guessing, is : The King's body is with the King, but not the King's soul : he's a King without kingliness. Moberly: Apparently a sententious maxim from some political book. 'The body politic is joined to the King, yet the King is not to be considered part of the body politic, but a thing apart.' [The present editor agrees with Clarendon, that Ham. is talking nonsense designedly.]"

Lloyd (Crit. Essay, Singer's 2d ed. p. 345): Beautiful as the soliloquy in this scene is, I am disposed to think that the excision of it may have been deliberate,— as unnecessary, prolonging the action, and, it may be, exhibiting the weakness of Ham. too crudely; it shows him making the most definite of his resolutions to revenge precisely as he turns his back upon the last opportunity by quitting the country. The passage, however, with some others, is too fine to be suppressed, though I am inclined to think the poet sacrificed them, and worthily and properly they may take their place in brackets."

To stir without great argument, upon every trifling occasion, is not an attribute of greatness; it is rather the attribute of smallness, of a mere love of fighting; but it is the attribute of greatness to stir instantly and at a trifle when honor is touched. The mere fact that For. is astir, and Ham. is still, does not prove the former to be the greater man, or make him an example to the latter. But because, for the merest fantasy that his honor was touched, he was going to his grave as to a bed, herein lies the contrast and example to Ham. Moreover, when 'not' is joined to the copula, and a comma placed after it, the force of 'But' is felt, thus: True greatness is not (predicate), but it is this. Include the 'not' in the predicate, and 'But' becomes inconsequent: True greatness is (predicate), but it is this. Capell perceived this, and added a second not as a compromise, embracing both readings: 'Is not, not to stir,' &c. DELIUS does not actually add the second not, but he says it is understood, or rather that the 'not' belongs to both copula and predicate. This discussion may seem trifling enough, but we must remember that: Rightly to punctuate is not, to put a stop without great argument, but greatly to find quarrel in a comma when Shakespeare's at the stake.

But be that as it may, there can be no doubt that if a modern editor adheres to F1 in this omission, he ought to restore to Hor. (what comes very awkwardly from the Queen) lines 14,15; and that, whether he chooses to retain or omit the 'Gentleman,' he ought to make the Queen's speech begin with line 16. White: I see no reason for deviating from F1. Lines 14, 15 are much more appropriate in the Queen's mouth, as a reflection by which she is led to change her determination with regard to Oph., than as a direct warning to a queen from a subject. CLARKE: We think there is something exquisitely appropriate in making Hamlet's beloved friend Hor. the one who watches over and tenderly thinks for Oph. during the Prince's absence, and brings her to his mother alone. Feeling thus, we believe it to have been Shakespeare's reconsidered intention. Clarendon: Lines 11-13, so cautiously obscure, seem better suited to an ordinary courtier than to Hor."

Linley (an accomplished amateur, and brother of the highly-gifted Mrs Sheridan) collected and published 'the wild and pathetic melodies of Oph., as he remembered them to have been exquisitely sung by Mrs Forster, when she was Miss Field, and belonged to Drury- lane Theatre;' and he says 'the impression remained too strong on his mind to make him doubt the correctness of the airs, agreeably to her delivery of them.' Dr Arnold also noted them down from the singing of Mrs Jordan. Mr Ayrton has followed that version in Knight's Shakespeare. The notes of the air to this first song of Ophelia's are the same in both; but in the former it is in three-quarter time, in the latter in common time. The melody is printed in common time in The Beggar's Opera (1728), to 'You'll think, e'er many days ensue,' and in The Generous Freemason, 1731. The following is the tune; but in singing Ophelia's fragments, each line should begin on the first of the bar, and not with the note before it. In the ballad-operas it has the burden, Twang, lang, dildo dee, at the end, with two additional bars of music."

        "Strachey (p. 53): If we bear in mind the notorious fact that, in the dreadful visitation of mental derangement, delicate and refined women will use language so coarse that it is difficult to guess where they can ever have even heard such words, and certain that wherever heard they would have always lain, unknown of, and innocuous, in the mind, unless the hot-bed of mental fever had quickened them for the first time into life; — if we remember this fact, and couple it with the consideration that the infant ears of the motherless Ophelia might have heard the talk and the songs of such a nurse as that of Juliet, we shall find nothing improbable, nor even unseemly, in the poor girl's songs — not only nothing to disturb our faith in the unsullied purity of her maiden mind, but nothing to cloud the bright beauty of that purity with even the slightest passing breath. [Mrs Jameson was, I think, the first to suggest that Oph. may have been sung to sleep in infancy by snatches of old ballads such as these, and Mrs Cowden Clarke has carried out the idea in her story of The Rose of 'Elsinore, where Botilda, the nurse, is scolded for singing this song to her infant charge.] Hudson (Shakespeare: His Life, Art, &c, Boston, 1872, ii, 281): The immodesty of some of these songs is surpassingly touching; it tells us, as nothing else could, that Oph. is utterly unconscious of what she is saying.",

In Pills to purge Melancholy (1707), ii, 44) it is printed to a song in Heywood's Rape of Lucrece, beginning, 'Arise, arise, my juggy, my puggy.' Other versions will be found under the name of 'Who list to lead a soldier's life?' and 'Lord Thomas and Fair Ellinor.'"

        "Douce: daughter] This is a common story among the vulgar in Gloucestershire, and is thus related: 'Our Saviour went into a baker's shop where they were baking, and asked for some bread to eat. The mistress of the shop immediately put a piece of dough into the oven to bake for him, but was reprimanded by her daughter, who, insisting that the piece of dough was too large, reduced it to a very small size. The dough, however, immediately afterwards began to swell, and presently became of a most enormous size. Whereupon the baker's daughter cried out, \"Heugh, heugh, heugh,\" which owl-like noise probably induced our Saviour for her wickedness to transform her into that bird.' This story is often related to children, in order to deter them from such illiberal behavior to poor people. Caldecott: The plumage of the melancholy bird, and the color of the baker, in correspondence with her father's 'white shroud,' and probably her own habit, may have suggested, to a bewildered mind, this singular allusion. Elze: As little did the baker's daughter expect to be turned into an owl as it occurred to my father and myself to anticipate the kind of death we should die. Doering (p. 79): Oph. feels that she has acted towards Ham. in an equally heartless manner."

The custom continued until the last century, and is graphically alluded to by Gay. The custom of the different sexes choosing themselves mates on St Valentine's day, 14th February, the names being selected either by lots or methods of divination, is of great antiquity in England. The name so drawn was the Valentine of the drawer. Douce traces the custom to the Lupercalia of Rome, during which a similar custom prevailed. There is nothing in the life of the Saint himself which can authorize such a practice, and his day was merely selected as most fit in point of time whereon to engraft a Christian festival. It was also believed that on this day birds chose their mates. Pepys gives some quaint notices of 'Valentines' in his Diary under date 14th and 16th Feb., 1666, and 14th and 18th Feb., 1667."

How arranged is neither here nor there; but opportunities of chartering a free cruiser could not have been wanting to a prince of Denmark, and, what is more significant, the fleet of Fortinbras was then in port at Elsinor. There is an understanding, just ever so vaguely glanced at, between the two young princes. But the following lines admit of but one interpretation: \"Let it work; For 'tis the sport to have the enginer Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard But I will delve one YARD BELOW THEIR MINES AND BLOW THEM AT THE MOON !\" One would think it required a miraculous allowance of critical obtuseness to ignore a counterplot so strikingly pre- announced. . . . To make assurance doubly sure, comes the letter to Hor., \"In the grapple I boarded them; on the instant they got clear of our ship; so I alone became their prisoner. They dealt with me like thieves of mercy; BUT THEY KNEW WHAT THEY DID.\" Can circumstantial proof go farther? Could any twelve men of sense, on such a record, acquit Ham. of being an accessory before, as well as after the fact?' [See Snider, Appendix, Vol. II, p."

[This was not repeated in Theobald's ed., but it is adopted by Tschischwitz. Ed.] Elze: Perhaps we should read crimes. Clarke: That is, turn all my attempts to restrain him into so many injuries perpetrated against his innocence and good qualities. Daniel (p. 76): Read gyres, i.e. his 'wild and whirling' actions, his mad eccentricities. Clarendon: Compare, 'And made their bends adornings.' — Ant. & Cleo. II. ii, 213. Elze (Shakespeare-Jahrbuch, xi, 295, and also The Athenaeum, 20 Feb. 1869): The corruption appears to be here not in 'gyves,' but in 'graces.' How can corporeal 'gyves' be converted into incorporeal, abstract 'graces'? That is more than even the well at Knaresborough could do. An abstract noun in this connection ruins the whole metaphor, and is illogical. If we substitute some abstract noun for 'gyves,' while restoring logical propriety, we deprive the simile of all significant clearness, force, and depth, and to introduce the wonder-working spring in order to compare together two abstract qualities would be pointless, and assuredly not in accordance with Shakespeare's genius and style. Read, therefore: graves. Graves, now spelled greaves, is found also in 2 Hen. IV: IV, iv, 50, where, as here, something mean becomes ennobled. For the spelling, compare 'thraves,' instead of threaves (Chapman's Iliad, xi, 477); and 'stale,' instead of steale or stele (lb. iv, 173). Stratmann praises this emendation of Elze's as judicious."

I therefore suspect that we ought to read: 'love is begone by time.' I suppose that Sh. places the syllable be before gone, as we say be-paint, be-spatter, be-think, &c, or possibly we should read 'by-gone.' Bailey (ii, 14): The dominant idea of the speech is that love is abated by time. Read 'love is begnawn by time,' an expression which exactly conveys the sense required, while the change requisite for perverting it into the received text is slight. Compare Rich.

How it got back again into the heart, they did not know. Clarendon: The meaning is that the mere recognition of a duty without the will to perform it, while it satisfies for a moment, enfeebles the moral nature. We have the same notion of sighs wasting the vital powers in 2 Hen. VI: III, ii, 63; Mid. N. D., Ill, ii, 97. [See Rom. & Jul.

What an abandonment also of the great design of the tragedy (as announced in the First Act), that there should be a train laid which is to bring about the catastrophe while the principal actor is not cognizant of it, and has, of course, no part in it.

It should be remembered that the account here given is that of a friend, and that the Queen could not possibly know what passed in the mind of Oph. when she placed herself in so perilous a situation. After the facts had been weighed and considered, the priest in the next Act pronounces that her death was doubtful. Seymour (ii, 197): As the Queen seems to give this description from ocular knowledge, it may be asked why, apprised as she was of Ophelia's distraction, she did not take steps to prevent the fatal catastrophe, especially as there was so fair an opportunity of saving her while she was, by her clothes, borne 'mermaid-like-up,' and the Queen was at leisure to hear her 'chanting old tunes.' T. C. [Thomas Campbell?] (Blackwood's Maga., Feb. 1818, p. 511): Perhaps this description by the Queen is poetical rather than dramatic; but its exquisite beauty prevails, and Oph., dying and dead, is still the same Oph. that first won our love. Perhaps the very forgetfulness of her throughout the remainder of the play, leaves the soul at full liberty to dream of the departed. She has passed away from the earth like a beautiful air,—a delightful dream. There would have been no place for her in the agitation and tempest of the final catastrophe. We are satisfied that she is in her grave. And in place of beholding her involved in the shocking troubles of the closing scene, we remember that her heart lies at rest, and the remembrance is like the returning voice of melancholy music. Hudson: This passage is deservedly celebrated, and aptly illustrates the Poet's power of making the description of a thing better than the thing itself, by giving us his eyes to see it with. CLARENDON: This speech of the Queen is certainly unworthy of its author and of the occasion. The enumeration of plants is quite as unsuitable to so tragical a scene as the description of the Dover cliff, in Lear, IV, vi, 11-24. Besides, there was no one by to witness the death of Oph., else she would have been rescued."

        "Sir John Hawkins: Crowner's Quest law] I strongly suspect that this is in ridicule of a case of forfeiture of a lease to the Crown, reported by Plowden in his 3 Eliza. It seems that Sir James Hales drowned himself in a river in a fit of insanity (produced, it is supposed, by his having been one of the judges who condemned Lady Jane Grey), and the question was whether this did not work a forfeiture to the Crown of his lease. The coroner sat on him, and a verdict of felo de se was rendered. The legal and logical subtilties arising in the course of the case gave a very fair opportunity of sneering at ' Crowner's Quest law': — Walsh said that the act consists of three parts. The first is the imagination, which is a reflection or meditation of the mind, whether or no it is convenient for him to destroy himself, and what way it can be done. The second is the resolution, which is a determination of the mind to destroy himself, and to do it in this or that particular way. The third is the perfection, which is the execution of what the mind has resolved to do. And this perfection consists of two parts, viz. the beginning and the end. The beginning is the doing of the act which causes death, and the end is the death, which is only a sequel to the act.' Much subtilty was expended in finding out whether Sir James was the agent or the patient; or, in other words, whether he went to the water or the water came to him: — ' Sir James Hales was dead, and how came he to his death? It may be answered, by drowning; and who drowned him? Sir James Hales; and when did he drown him? In his life time. So that Sir James Hales being alive caused Sir James Hales to die, and the act of the living man was the death of the dead man. And then for this offence it is reasonable to punish the living man who committed the offence, and not the dead man. But how can he be said to be punished alive when the punishment comes after death ?' &c, &c. Malone thinks that Sh. must have heard of this case in conversation, for it was determined before he was born, and Plowden's Commentaries were not translated until towards the end of the eighteenth century."

We must suppose the alehouse understood, and pointed to by the First Clo. White: I suspect that this is a misprint for Tavern. But some local allusion understood at the day may lurk under it. J. San (N. & Qu., 5 Oct. 1861): This is merely Shakespeare's English way of representing the Danish Johan,—John. Nicholson (N. & Qu., 29 July, 1871): Most probably Yaughan was the well-known keeper of a tavern near the theatre; and we have three items of corroborative evidence which show: First, that a little before the tirce of this allusion by Sh., which is not found in the Qq, there was about town ' a Jew, one Yohan,' most probably a German Jew, who was a perruquier,—he is mentioned by Jonson in Every Man out of his Humour, V, vi; Second, in The Alchemist, I, i, which was produced eleven years afterwards, Subtle speaks of ' an alehouse, darker than deaf John,' a name which sounds like that of our foreign John, anglicised, and its owner grown deaf by lapse of time; Third, that there was actually an alehouse attached to the Globe Theatre is proved by the ' Sonnett upon the Burneing' of that playhous* 'see Collier's Annals of the Stage, i, 388). Is it then unlikely that our wandering Jew, either in search of a business, or as a profitable extension of his theatrical connection, set up ' the Globe Public-house;' and was thus, as the known refresher of the thirsty actors and audience, mentioned by both Sh. and Jonson ? Clarendon: It is impossible to detect the meaning which lies under this corruption. Elze (Shakespeare- Jahrbuch, xi, 297), who accepts without qualification San's and Nicholson's suggestion, asks whether there be not an allusion to the same Johan in the sneering ' Johannes factotum ' that Greene applies to Sh. C Elliot Browne (Athenaeum, 29 July, 1876): Yaughan is a common Welsh name, and it is surely only necessary to suppose that it was borne by some Welsh tavern-keeper near the theatre.",

But Gascoigne, who was ten years old when Surrey was beheaded, attributes the poem in question to Lord Vaux, in an Epistle to a Young Gentleman, prefixed to his Posies: 'The L.

The game so called resembles bowls, but with notable differences. First, it is played not on a green, but on a floor strewed with ashes. The Jack is a wheel of lignum-vitae or other hard wood, nine inches in diameter and three or four inches thick. The loggat, made of apple- wood, is a truncated cone 26 or 27 inches in length, tapering from a girth of 8½ or 9 inches at the one end to 6½ or 4 inches at the other. Each player has three loggats which he throws, holding lightly the thin end. The object is to lie as near the Jack as possible. The only place we have heard of where this once popular game is now played is the Hampshire Hog Inn, Norwich. We have to thank the Rev. G. Gould for a detailed description of the game, which we have abridged as above. Perhaps Ham. meant to compare the skull to the Jack at which the bones were thrown. In Jonson's Tale of a Tub, IV, vi: \"Now are they tossing of his legs and arms Like loggats at a pear tree.\"'"

        "Lowell (Among My Books, p. 210): guest] This Grave-diggers' scene always impresses me as one of the most pathetic in the whole tragedy. That Sh. introduced such scenes and such characters with deliberate intention, and with a view to artistic relief and contrast, there can hardly be a doubt. We must take it for granted that a man whose works show everywhere the results of judgement sometimes acted with forethought. I find the springs of the profoundest sorrow and pity in this hardened indifference of the Grave-diggers, in their careless discussion as to whether Ophelia's death was by suicide or no, in their singing and jesting at their dreary work. We know who is to be the guest of this earthen hospitality, — how much beauty, love, and heart-break are to be covered in that pit of clay. All we remember of Oph. reacts upon us with tenfold force, and we recoil from our amusement at the ghastly drollery of the two delvers with a shock of horror. That the unconscious Ham. should stumble on this grave of all others, that it should be here that he should pause to muse humorously on death and decay, — all this prepares us for the revulsion of passion in the next scene, and for the frantic confession: 'I loved Ophelia; forty thousand brothers Could not with all their quantity of love Make up my sum!' And it is only here that such an asseveration would be true even to the feeling of the moment; for it is plain from all we know of Ham. that he could not so have loved Oph., that he was incapable of the self- abandonment of a true passion, that he would have analyzed this emotion as he does all others, would have peeped and botanized upon it till it became to him a mere matter of scientific interest. All this force of contrast, and this horror of surprise, were necessary so to intensify his remorseful regret that he should believe himself for once in earnest. ... The speech of the King, 'Oh, he is mad, Laertes,' recalls him to himself, and he at once begins to rave."

Ed.]: 'Why might not this hauc bene some lawier's pate, The which sometimes brib'd, brawl'd, and tooke a fee And lawe exacted to the highest rate; Why might not this be such a one as he?

        "Malone: quillets] Nice and frivolous distinctions. The word is rendered by Cole, Lat. Diet.; res frivola. Nares follows Bailey in deriving it from quibblett a diminutive of quibble. Douce (i, 231) derives it from quidlibet. But Nares objects to this, that the scholastic phrase was uniformly quodlibet, never quidlibet. WEDGWOOD: Notwithstanding Nares's objection that the scholastic phrase was quodlibet, and not quidlibet, the derivation from this source was probably correct. F. J. V. (N. & Qu., 18 Sept. 1875): As 'quiddit' is from the logical term quiditas, why may not ' quillet ' or ' quilit ' be from another logical term, qualitas? The word may have been originally qualil, then the a may have been thinned into i to make it jingle with 'quiddit.'",

The observation is just, and will be allowed by every human being who shall reflect on the course of his own life. TYRWHITT suggested that the rest of Hamlet's speech after ' Rashly,' and Horatio's reply, 'That is most certain,' should be put in a parenthesis, so that ' Rashly ' may be joined in construction with ' in the dark Groped I,' &c. He also reads : ' And praised be rashness, for it lets us know,' and does not put a period after ' will ' at the end of the speech, but prints ' will ; — '. Although Staunton in a note said that he agreed with Tyrwhitt's suggestion, he nevertheless did not conform his text thereto. Undoubtedly there is force in Tyrwhitt's arrangement. Collier : The reasoning in this passage is consecutive in Hamlet's mind, but, perhaps, hardly so in his expressions. Tschischwitz follows Tyrwhitt, except that he prints 'for it let us know,' because 'let' is clearly the perfect tense, since Ham. is speaking of an act that is past.",

Dyce (in his first ed. retaining fall in his text) cites the parallel phrase: 'And if I fail not in my deep intent' Rich. Ill: I, i, 149. Collier (ed. 2): Very possibly 'fail' of the (MS) is the true word. Clarendon interprets pall: 'to grow vapid, and tasteless, like wine ; hence to become vain and worthless,' and cites the passage from Ant. & Cleo. cited by Malone. Ingleby (The Sh. Fabrications, p. 115) suggests that fall and 'fail' were used as synonymous by Sh., and cites in proof Cent, of Err. I, ii, 37 ; and Merry Wives, I, i, 262 ; and Sir John Old castle : 'London' you say, is safely look'd unto, Alas, poor rebels, there your aid must fall.'- In a note on ' if ye fall in't ' in The Two Noble Kinsmen, III, vi, 236, Littledale says that Ingleby has confirmed him in thinking that ' fall,' and not fail, is the right reading in that passage, and he gives a fuller note from Ingleby than is contained in The Sh. Fabrications cited above, as follows : Compare line 272 [of this same scene in The Two Noble Kinsmen] : ' Let it not fall agen, Sir.' There are remarkable instances of the use of this intransitive verb as a synonym of fail. Sh. affords us only two certain examples of this : ' her better judgement May fall to match you with her country forms And happily repent.' — Oth. Ill, iii, 237. Here ' fall' is not happen (Schmidt, wrongly, begin, get into), but fail. [The second instance is the present passage in Hamlet, where] pall is nonsense; and fall makes sense. Fall, of course, is the opposite of succeed. Now our word for this is ' fail.' There is also one example in The London Prodigal, and two in Isaiah, xxxi, 3, and lvii, 14, 15.

Whoever recollects the profession of Shakespeare's father will admit that his son might be no stranger to such terms. I have frequently seen packages of wool pinned up with skewers. Caldecott says that the phrase is doubtless technical, in so far as it is drawn from a handicraft, and that, as the use of tools is general, the phrases belonging to them pass into general use. Knight fleers at Farmer's suggestion ; and Hunter (ii, 264) says 'the sooner it is expunged the better. Rough-hew is ijot and never was technical.

Warburton : They had begun to act, to my destruction, before I knew there was a Play towards. Ere I could mark the prologue. Heath (p. 549) agrees with his predecessors in thinking that 'They' refers to 'villains,' not to ' brains,' and paraphrases : Before I could take the very first step towards forming my own scheme, they had already proceeded a considerable way in the execution of theirs. JOHNSON was the first to refer ' They' to its right antecedent, 'brains': 'Before he could summon his faculties, and propose to himself what should be done, a complete scheme of action presented itself to him. His mind operated before he had excited it.' Caldecott returns to Heath's interpretation, as do Delius and Elze, but, with these exceptions, all the rest follow Johnson. Clarke sees herein a vivid picture of Shakespeare's own mode of composition, his teeming brains beginning a play, and seeing all its scope and bearings, ere he had well penned the opening words. Moberly : 'Before I formed my real plan, my brains had done the work. This line should be carefully remarked. Ham. writes the commission under a strong impulse rather of imagination than will, the ingenuity of the trick captivating him. Then the encounter with the pirate puts an end to the chance of undoing it ; and thus he is driven, somewhat uneasily, to justify his action to Hor. As the latter receives his narrative with something like surprise, and even with a touch of compassion, we may conclude with safety that Hamlet's kindly nature would have cancelled the letters but for the accident which hindered his doing so.'"

        "Theobald (after Warburton): comma] Theobald (Nichols's Lit. Hist, ii, 579), writing to his 'most affectionate friend,' Warburton, says that it should be either 'no comma,' i. e. as no bar should stand between their friendships: — Or, 'And stand a comma 'tween their enmities? i. e. as peace should intervene and prevent enmities.' He did not repeat these suggestions in his ed., but adopted Warburton's emendation, and justifies it in a note which he attributes to Warburton : 'The poet without doubt wrote, \"And stand a Commere\" i. e. a guarantee, a common mother. Nothing can be more picturesque than this image of Peace's standing, drest in her wheaten garland, between the two Princes, and extending a hand to each. We thus frequently see her on Roman coins.' But Warburton, in his ed., goes further, and says that Commere here means 'a trafficker in love, one who brings people together, a procuress.' [Cotgrave sustains him in this meaning.] Capell (Notes, &c, i, 147) was taken by this allusion to Peace as represented on coins, and so adopted Commere. Heath (p. 549) well interprets : ' As a comma stands between two several members of a sentence, without separating them otherwise than by distinguishing the one from the other, in like manner peace personized, or the Goddess of Peace, is understood to stand between the amities of the two kings.' [Dyce (ed. ii) cites this paraphrase of Heath's, and adds : ' Perhaps so.'] JOHNSON : The comma is the note of connection and continuity of sentences ; the period is the note of abruption and disjunction. Sh. had it perhaps in his mind to write, — That unless England complied with the mandate, war should put a period to their amity; he altered his mode of diction, and thought that, in an opposite sense, he might put, that peace should stand a comma between their amities. Becket (Shakespeare' s Himself Again, i, 73) suggested, 'And stand a co-mate? i. e. 'companion ; peace should be associate with them.' Staunton considered this 'co-mate within the range of possibility.' And Elze (Athen&um, 11 Aug. 1866) lit upon the same conjecture independently of Becket, and thinks that this coincidence adds strength. It should be added that Elze, one of the very best English scholars in Germany, had merely heard at the time of Becket's conjecture, and had no knowledge of the quality of the rest of that wild 'Nonsense Book.' Tschischwitz follows Becket. Caldecott cites : 'I feare the point of the sword will make a comma to your cunning.' — N. Breton's Packet of Letters, p. 23, 1637. Hunter (ii, 264) thinks Sh. meant to ridicule such an absurd expression in some speech or document of the time. Singer (ed. ii) reads, 'And stand a co-mere,' i. e< 'as a mark defining them. Mere is a boundary mark, the lapis terminalis of the ancients; and it should be remembered that the god of meres or bounds, Terminus, was wont to end the strifes and controversies of people in dividing their lands.' To this suggestion Dyce (ed. i) adds : 'But our author's text is not to be amended by the insertion of words coined expressly for the occasion ; and to me at least all this tampering of critics with the passage does not prove that it is corrupt.' White finds 'comma' incomprehensible, and adopts Hanmer's reading, cement, which 'is supported, in accent and all, by Ant. & Cleo. Ill, ii, 29. And see Octavia's subsequent description of herself, scene iv, as standing between, praying for both parts. Clarke: 'Comma' is here employed as the term applied by theoretical musicians to express 'the least of all the sensible intervals in music,' showing the exact proportions between accords. Tuners of organs and piano-fortes use the word 'comma' thus to the present day. The term in its musical sense is fully explained in Hawkins's Hist, of Music (pp. 28,122,410, ed. Novello, 1853). From the context of the present passage, there is far greater probability that Sh. had in view a term referring to concord, than one alluding to the method of stopping ; and we think that he here uses the word 'comma' to express a link of amicably harmonious connection. That he was well acquainted with various technical terms in music we have several proofs in his writings. Bailey (i, 55) : 'That Peace wearing a garland should stand as a punctuation-mark between persons or abstractions of any kind is as pure nonsense as ever flowed from penman or printer. I suggest, \"And hold her olive 'tween their amities.\" ' Compare Shakespeare's use of ' the olive ' elsewhere in 2 Hen. IV, and Twelfth Night. The transformation of holds her olive into 'stands a comma' arose 'by a very simple blunder. It is clearly a case of the incorporation of a marginal direction into the text. The compositor had before him the genuine line, and put it accurately into type, except that he omitted to place the mark of elision (') before tween, and the proof-reader wrote the correction in full, 'a comma,' in the margin ; this the compositor inserted in the text under the misconception that • a comma ' was to be substituted for ' her olive.' And thus ' hold a comma ' was next changed into ' stand a comma.' In Q2 'there is no elision mark [if Bailey had said comma here, would it not have revealed the fallacy of his whole theory? would the proof-reader have called for 'comma' when he meant an apostrophe ? Ed.] before tween, which is just what my theory requires; for, supposing the error to have been made originally in Q2, it is obvious that the words a comma would be introduced into the text instead of the elision mark.' Cartwright {New Readings, &c, p. 37) proposed, 'And stand as one atween ;' two years later (N. <5r* Qu., 20 June, 1868) he conjectured, 'And stand as concord' J. Wetherell (N. 6° Qu., 27 June, 1868) : Read: 'And stand at-one between their majesties'"

Malone: From The Hystorie of Hamblet, it appears that the faithful ministers of Fengon were not unacquainted with the import of the letters they bore [see Vol. II, p. 103]. Sh. probably meant to describe their representatives, Ros. and Guil., as equally guilty. So that Hamlet's procuring their execution, though certainly not absolutely necessary to his own safety, does not appear to have been a wanton and unprovoked cruelty. Steevens : I apprehend that a critic and a juryman are bound to form their opinions on what they see and hear in the cause before them, and not to be influenced by extraneous particulars unsupported by legal evidence in open court. I persist in observing, that from Shakespeare's drama no proofs of the guilt of Ros. and Guil. can be collected. They may be convicted by the old Hystorie ; but if the tragedy forbears to criminate, it has no right to sentence them. This is sufficient for the commentator's purpose. It is not his office to interpret the plays of Sh. according to the novels on which they are founded, — novels which the poet sometimes followed, but as often materially deserted. Perhaps he never confined himself strictly to the plan of any one of his originals. His negligence of poetic justice is notorious; nor can we expect that he who was content to sacrifice the pious Oph. should have been more scrupulous about the worthless lives of Ros. and Guil. Therefore I assert that in the tragedy before us their deaths appear wanton and unprovoked; and the critic, like Bayes, must have recourse to somewhat long before the beginning of the play to justify the conduct of its hero. Pye (p. 326) : There is not one word uttered by Ros. and Guil. throughout the play that does not proclaim them to the most superficial observer as creatures of the King, purposely employed to- feetxa^LHam., their friend and fellow-student. Strachey (p. 96) : Something more than Hamlet's own preservation is at stake; he is the representative and avenger of the rights of the crown and laws of Denmark, outraged by a murderer and a usurper, (for he was only elected because he contrived to murder the rightful possessor at a moment when his natural heir was absent) ; and he has to act under those circumstances, which at rare and long intervals in the history of every country, call on some man to maintain the spirit of the laws by disregarding for a moment their letter. It is Hamlet's duty to avenge the crown and laws of Denmark by putting the tyrant to death ; and if as a means to that end he has to sacrifice also the base instruments of the tyrant's will, he is justified in doing it."

Walker in dealing with this passage exhibited, as his admirable editor, Lettsom, well says, profound critical sagacity, and, almost entirely unaided by any old copies, put aside ancient and modern corruptions, and made his way at once to the genuine reading: 'It may be observed' (Vers. 281) 'that thinks it thee also occurs in the Elizabethan poets in the sense of fitiv donel col.' He then cites the present passage, and gives the reading of the present text; and also corrects the same phrase in Cartwright, The Ordinary, III, ii (Dodsley, x, 216): '\"Little think'st thee how diligent thou art To little purpose.\" Thinks't thee, of course. (I understand, by the way, that the thinks in methinks is, originally and etymologically, not the same with our present verb to think ; but that it is a corruption of another verb signifying to seem; so that methinks is as it appears to me. y Clarendon offers another solution : Perhaps the true reading is 'thinks thee,' the final s of the Quarto being mistaken for e. The word 'think' in this passage is not the same in origin as 'think ' used personally, but comes from Anglosaxon thincan, to seem, appear, which is used impersonally with all personal pronouns. The other word is then- can, to think, and the distinction is maintained in the German dilnken and denken. In Rich. Ill : III, i, 63 : 'Where it seems best unto your royal self,' for 'seems,' which is the reading of the earliest Qq, the later editions have 'thinkst ' or ‘think'st.’",

Almost inextricable confusion seems to have been made by the Elizabethan authors between two distinct idioms: (1) 'it stands on' (adv.), or 'at hand,' or 'upon' (comp. 'instat,' irpooquei), i.e. 'it is of importance,' 'it concerns,' 'it is a matter of duty;' and (2) 'I stand upon' (adj.), i. e. 'I insist upon.' In (1) the full phrase would be: ' it stands me upon,’ but, owing to the fact that ‘to me’ or ‘me’ {the dative infection) is unemphatic, and ‘upon’ is emphatic and often used at the end of the sentence, the words were trans- posed into, ' it stands me upon?’ 'Me' was thus naturally taken for the object of upon. [In the present passage] it means 'it is imperative on me.’ Clarendon: The construction is here interrupted by the parenthesis."

As to its pronunciation, Skinner derives the name & sono naturali quern avis edit, and Cotgrave translates Cau6 (clearly a case of onomatopoeia), and Cauvette, by A Chough or Jacke Daw. Finally, Ritson (p. 92) says that the name of the Cornish bird is pronounced by the natives chow, which is conclusive. CaldeCOTT doubts much if, in the present instance, from its association with wealth, it have any relation to that bird, but inclines to think it should be chuff. [Is not Caldecott right here? The chow is, perhaps, applicable to Osr. on the score of chattering, but how about the spacious possession of dirt, the special application made by Ham.? If chuff be here meant its application accords with Cotgrave's use of the word : ‘Franc-gontier. A sub. stanciall yonker, wealthie chuffe ;’ or again, ‘Maschefouyn : A chuffe, boore, lob- cocke, lozell; one that is fitter to feed with cattell, then to conuerse with men.’ GlFFORD (Massinger's Duke of Milan, III, i, p. 279, ed. Gifford) says ‘chuff is always used in a bad sense, and means a coarse, unmannered clown, at once sordid and wealthy.’ Dyce ( Gloss, s. v. chuff) adds instances corroborating Gifford from A Gorgious Gallery of Gallant Inventions, 1578, and Marlowe's Ovid's Elegies.

        "Johnson: yet but yaw] Johnson: I believe raw to be the right word; it is a word of great latitude ; it signifies unripe, immature, thence unformed, imperfect, unskil- ful. The best account of him would be imperfect in respect of his quick sail. The phrase 'quick sail' was, I suppose, a proverbial term for activity of mind. HEATH : The meaning undoubtedly is that Laer. was but young (raw) in proportion to the quick progress he had made in all gentlemanly accomplishments. Caldecott : Raw is unready, untrained, and awkward. Compare Per. IV, ii, 60; As You Like It, III, ii, 76. Dyce (Remarks, &c, p. 220) : 'Nothing, I think, can be more cer- tain than that the passage should stand thus : \"and it [which was often mistaken by our early printers for 'yet,' perhaps because it was written yf\\ but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.'* \"To yaw (as a ship), hue illuc vacillare, capite nutare.\" —Coles's Diet The substantive \"yaw\" occurs in Massinger : \"O, the yaws that she will make ! Look to your stern, dear mistress, and steer right, Here's that will work as high as the Bay of Portugal.\" — Very Woman, III, v ; Works, iv, 293, ed. 1805, where GifTord remarks : \"A yaw is that unsteady motion which a ship makes in a great swell, when, in steering, she inclines to the right or left of her course.\" ' Elze thinks the possible solution of this difficulty is to consider 'yaw' as a transitive verb, and he thus interprets: 'An inventory of Laertes s excellences would dizzy the arithmetic of memory ; yet it would not let it stagger hither and thither (like a badly- steered ship), in view of his quick sail.' A quick-sailing ship holds a steadier course than one that sails slowly. Staunton says he must admit his inability to understand Dyce's reading, and adds: 'Yet' is certainly suspicious, but the word displaced we have always thought was wit, not it, and the drift of Hamlet's jargon to be this : his qualifications are so numerous, and so far surpass all ordinary reckoning, that memory would grow giddy in cataloguing, and wit be distanced in attempting to keep pace with them. White: There seems0 to be no doubt that ‘yt} was mistaken for 'yet.' Clarke believes raw to be used in the same sense as in As You Like It, and interprets : 'your description is but inefficient and inadequate after all.' Abbott, § 128 : The ellipsis of the negative explains 'neither.' That is, 'do nothing but lag clum- sily behind neither.' 'Neither,' for our either, is in Shakespeare's manner, after a negative expressed or implied. TSCHISCHWITZ says raw is merely a misprint for row, and so gives it in his text, and thus interprets : 'Memory, even with the help of arith- metic, cannot overtake this swift sailer, but can only row while he sails. At the present day we should say : and yet but sail neither in respect of his full steam.' CLARENDON: If this passage stands as Sh. wrote it, any meaning it may have has defied the penetration of commentators to detect. If 'vet' is a mistake for yt or it, we should require some such word as let or make to precede. The sense would then be: 'to attempt to catalogue his perfections would dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and make it stagger, as it were, in pursuit of his swift-sailing ship.' 'The two meta- phors are a little difficult to separate.'"

        "Johnson: twelve for nine] Johnson: This wager I do not understand. In a dozen passes one must exceed the other more or less than three hits. Nor can I comprehend how, in a dozen, there can be twelve to nine. The passage is of no import- ance ; it is sufficient that there was a wager. Malone : The King hath laid that in a game of a doz:n passes, or bouts, Laer. does not exceed you three hits ; the King hath laid on the principle of him who makes a bet, with the chance of gaining twelve for nine that he may lose; or the King (by the advantage allowed to Ham.) hath odds, tantamount to four to three. If the words, 'he hath laid on,' refer to Laer., it means that he has laid on the principle of one who undertakes to make twelve passes for nine that his adversary shall make ; on the ratio of twelve to nine. Ritson (p. 212) maintains that there were to be but twelve passes in all, and 'Laer., to win, must have got eight hits, whereas Ham. would have won if he had got only five; so that he had clearly the advantage of Laer., in point of number, three whole passes or hits, and the odds were eight to five, which is in the same arith- metical proportion of twelve to nine, in Hamlet's favor before they began to play.' [This is, I think, virtually the same explanation as that given by Elze.] Seymour (ii, 203) : 'If in the dozen passes Ham. shall be hit seven times, and Laer. only three, the King will lose his wager.' Mitford {Gent. Mag. 1845) : The reading of the Ff of one for 'Maid on' may be an error for won, or on; indeed the whole phrase, 'he hath laid on twelve for nine,' seems very like an interpolation from the margin. One might say that, by a loose manner of speaking, not exceeding three hits may mean not exceeding more than two. It may also be observed that these numbers were probably represented by Arabic figures, and not by letters, and were more liable to be altered and made corrupt. Quarterly Review (March, 1847, vol. lxxix, p. 332) : Osric never stoops to use the language of ordinary mortals. 'He hath laid on twelve for nine' is not he has laid twelve to nine, but he has wagered for nine out of twelve. The King backs Ham. Laer., who is the celebrated fencer of the age, is to give the Prince great odds : — the King stipulates out of the twelve passes for nine hits from Laer. without his being declared winner. So also in the for- mer part of the sentence, 'he shall not exceed you three hits,' does not mean that the sum of Laertes's hits over Hamlet's shall not be more than three. In a dozen passes six hits each would place them on a par, and Osric calls Laertes's excess the number of hits that he makes above his own half. This, the King, bets, will not surpass three, rendering the total amount to nine, which tallies with the other form under which the bet is expressed. Moberly : 'Each is to attack twelve times, going on till a hit is made : and Laer. bets that he will hit Ham. twelve times before Ham. can hit him nine times. That is : Ham. has three points given him, and with these odds he trusts that he shall win.' Tschischwitz assumes that 'a dozen' is merely an indefinite number, and gives an elaborate calculation on the basis of twenty-one rounds. [It may be said of all these calculations what Clarendon says of one of them, they are doubtless correct, but do not explain- the form in which the wager is put.] Steevens refers this very 'unimportant passage' to the members of the Jockey Club, at Newmarket, 'who on such subjects may prove the most enlightened commentators, and most successfully bestir themselves in the cold unpoetic dabble of calculation.'"

This 'yesty collection' insinuates itself into people of the highest Quality, as yeast into the finest flour.",

This airy facility of talk sometimes imposes upon wise men. Who has not seen this observation verified?'",
        "Jennens: fond and winnowed] Jennens follows Q2, but modifies it in his text to 'profane and tres-renowned,' 'which is the French method of forming superlatives, i.e. the most renowned;' and paraphrases: such a superficial collection of knowledge as carries them through the most common {profane} and even the most renowned opinions, i.e. opinions, or branches of learning, which bring renown to the learned in them.",

The same opposition in terms is in the readings of the Qq: profane and vulgar are opposed to trenowned or thrice renowned.",
        "Tollet: fond and winnowed] Fanned and 'winnowed' occur together in Markham's Husbandry, pp. 18, 76, 77. So also 'fan and wind' in Tro. & Cres. V, iii, 41.",

Scholar, p. 422) advocates 'fond and winnowed,' and interprets: 'They go through and through (i.e. they stop at no absurdity in) the most fond (i.e. affected or foolish) and winnowed (i.e. elaborately sought out) opinions.' But White, having found that 'fan' and 'winnow' are 'often coupled in the writings of Shakespeare's day,' and ''fond\" (foolish) sorts ill with \"winnowed\" in its figurative sense,' in his subsequent edition agreed with Warburton and Dyce that 'fond' of the Ff is a misprint for fand, and added, 'of the meaning of the passage in this form I am not quite sure, though it is probably to be found in Dr Johnson's paraphrase.'",
        "Clarke: fond and winnowed] 'Probably \"fond\" is here used to express \"fondly cherished,\" \"dearly esteemed,\" while \"winnowed\" means \"choice,\" \"select.\" \"Fond\" is thus used in I, v, 99.'",
        "B. Nicholson: fond and winnowed] (N. & Qu., 16 Jan. 1864): Ham. of course means that Osr. and his compeers have not that inward wit necessary to parley true euphuism, but only the outward trick of the language, which while it passed with folks of like mind, would not stand the trial of better judgement If for 'winnowed' or trennowed, we read vinewed or vinnewed—and blue vinney is Dorsetshire, and vinewedst is spelt in the Ff of Tro. & Cres. 'whinidst,'—we have a change that restores the sense, — a word not incongruous with, but suggested by, the metaphorical yesty collection, and a repetition of that Shakespearian expression, a 'mouldy wit.' .... The 'yesty collection' is the frothiness of sour and stale beer, which passes with those of corrupted and vitiated taste; but when tried and blown upon by the more sober judgement flies off, and does not remain like the true head of sound liquor or wit. Subsequently (N. & Qu., 31 Dec. 1864), Nicholson added that he had forgotten the variant of vinewed, which is fenowed or fennowed. 'The last was doubtless the form chosen by Sh. in this passage.'",
        "Bailey: fond and winnowed] (ii, 17) changes this whole passage thus: 'only got the tune of the time, and out of the habit of encounter [got] a kind of yesty diction which .... the most profound and renowned opinions.' In support, he adds: 1. That the verb 'got' governs both the 'tune of the time' and 'a kind of yesty diction, the latter of which the persons concerned got, 'out of the habit of encounter.' 2. That diction has been used by Ham. just before in the phrase, 'to make true diction of him.' 3. That 'most profound and renowned' comes much nearer the old reading than 'most fond and winnowed.' Besides, most winnowed is not English. We should not say of one sack of wheat amongst several that it was the most winnowed, but that it was the best winnowed.",
        "Tschischwitz: fond and winnowed] Tschischwitz proposed and adopted in his text: 'profound and winnowed,' on the ground that two opposite ideas, like 'fond' and 'winnowed,' cannot be connected by 'and' so long as 'most,' by qualifying both, combined them in one idea. 'People of Osric's class are like chaff that is to be found in a deep and well- sifted heap of wheat.'",

He had detected the King's villainy, and he knew his own counterplot would not long be secret. But it is plain that he suspected nothing in the challenge to fence with Laer. He never once examined the foils, of measured them, but picked up the first that came to hand, and took the length on trust. Just before, when Hor. warned him, he had said, 'The interim is mine,' and he clearly looked forward to having things his own way till the next news from England. [See Rom. & Jul. V, i, I.]"

        "'Are you no soooner hatched, with the lapwing, but you will run away with the shell on your head?' Malone: In Meres's Wit's Treasury, 1598: 'As the lapwing runneth away with the shell on her head as soon as she is hatched.' Caldecott : 'He is prematurely hasty, starts almost before he has means, ere he has found legs or mes- sage, to carry or be carried.' Clarendon : The lapwing was also a symbol of in- sincerity, from its habit of alluring intruders from its nest by crying far away from it. Osr. was both forward and insincere.
