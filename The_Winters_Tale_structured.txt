ACT 1 SCENE 1

1: ARCHIDAMUS: If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on
2: the like occasion whereon my services are now on
3: foot, you shall see, as I have said, great
4: difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.
5: CAMILLO: I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
6: means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.
7: ARCHIDAMUS: Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
8: justified in our loves; for indeed--
9: CAMILLO: Beseech you,--
10: ARCHIDAMUS: Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:
11: we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
12: not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,
13: that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
14: may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse
15: us.
16: CAMILLO: You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.
17: ARCHIDAMUS: Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
18: and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.
19: CAMILLO: Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
20: They were trained together in their childhoods; and
21: there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,
22: which cannot choose but branch now. Since their
23: more mature dignities and royal necessities made
24: separation of their society, their encounters,
25: though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
26: with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
27: embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
28: though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
29: embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed
30: winds. The heavens continue their loves!
31: ARCHIDAMUS: I think there is not in the world either malice or
32: matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
33: comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
34: gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
35: into my note.
36: CAMILLO: I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
37: is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the
38: subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
39: crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
40: see him a man.
41: ARCHIDAMUS: Would they else be content to die?
42: CAMILLO: Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should
43: desire to live.
44: ARCHIDAMUS: If the king had no son, they would desire to live
45: on crutches till he had one.
ACT 1 SCENE 2

1: POLIXENES: Nine changes of the watery star hath been
2: The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
3: Without a burthen: time as long again
4: Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;
5: And yet we should, for perpetuity,
6: Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
7: Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
8: With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
9: That go before it.
10: LEONTES: Stay your thanks a while;
11: And pay them when you part.
12: POLIXENES: Sir, that's to-morrow.
13: I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
14: Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
15: No sneaping winds at home, to make us say
16: 'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd
17: To tire your royalty.
18: LEONTES: We are tougher, brother,
19: Than you can put us to't.
20: POLIXENES: No longer stay.
21: LEONTES: One seven-night longer.
22: POLIXENES: Very sooth, to-morrow.
23: LEONTES: We'll part the time between's then; and in that
24: I'll no gainsaying.
25: POLIXENES: Press me not, beseech you, so.
26: There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,
27: So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,
28: Were there necessity in your request, although
29: 'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
30: Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder
31: Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
32: To you a charge and trouble: to save both,
33: Farewell, our brother.
34: LEONTES: Tongue-tied, our queen?
35: speak you.
36: HERMIONE: I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
37: You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
38: Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
39: All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction
40: The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,
41: He's beat from his best ward.
42: LEONTES: Well said, Hermione.
43: HERMIONE: To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:
44: But let him say so then, and let him go;
45: But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
46: We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.
47: Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
48: The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
49: You take my lord, I'll give him my commission
50: To let him there a month behind the gest
51: Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,
52: I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
53: What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?
54: POLIXENES: No, madam.
55: HERMIONE: Nay, but you will?
56: POLIXENES: I may not, verily.
57: HERMIONE: Verily!
58: You put me off with limber vows; but I,
59: Though you would seek to unsphere the
60: stars with oaths,
61: Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,
62: You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
63: As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
64: Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
65: Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
66: When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?
67: My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'
68: One of them you shall be.
69: POLIXENES: Your guest, then, madam:
70: To be your prisoner should import offending;
71: Which is for me less easy to commit
72: Than you to punish.
73: HERMIONE: Not your gaoler, then,
74: But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you
75: Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
76: You were pretty lordings then?
77: POLIXENES: We were, fair queen,
78: Two lads that thought there was no more behind
79: But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
80: And to be boy eternal.
81: HERMIONE: Was not my lord
82: The verier wag o' the two?
83: POLIXENES: We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,
84: And bleat the one at the other: what we changed
85: Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
86: The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd
87: That any did. Had we pursued that life,
88: And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
89: With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
90: Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd
91: Hereditary ours.
92: HERMIONE: By this we gather
93: You have tripp'd since.
94: POLIXENES: O my most sacred lady!
95: Temptations have since then been born to's; for
96: In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
97: Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
98: Of my young play-fellow.
99: HERMIONE: Grace to boot!
100: Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
101: Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;
102: The offences we have made you do we'll answer,
103: If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
104: You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
105: With any but with us.
106: LEONTES: Is he won yet?
107: HERMIONE: He'll stay my lord.
108: LEONTES: At my request he would not.
109: Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest
110: To better purpose.
111: HERMIONE: Never?
112: LEONTES: Never, but once.
113: HERMIONE: What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
114: I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's
115: As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
116: Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
117: Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
118: With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
119: With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:
120: My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
121: What was my first? it has an elder sister,
122: Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!
123: But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
124: Nay, let me have't; I long.
125: LEONTES: Why, that was when
126: Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,
127: Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
128: And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
129: 'I am yours for ever.'
130: HERMIONE: 'Tis grace indeed.
131: Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:
132: The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;
133: The other for some while a friend.
134: LEONTES: [Aside] Too hot, too hot!
135: To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
136: I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;
137: But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment
138: May a free face put on, derive a liberty
139: From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,
140: And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;
141: But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,
142: As now they are, and making practised smiles,
143: As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere
144: The mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainment
145: My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,
146: Art thou my boy?
147: MAMILLIUS: Ay, my good lord.
148: LEONTES: I' fecks!
149: Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast
150: smutch'd thy nose?
151: They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
152: We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
153: And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf
154: Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling
155: Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
156: Art thou my calf?
157: MAMILLIUS: Yes, if you will, my lord.
158: LEONTES: Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,
159: To be full like me: yet they say we are
160: Almost as like as eggs; women say so,
161: That will say anything but were they false
162: As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false
163: As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
164: No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true
165: To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
166: Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
167: Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
168: Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
169: Thou dost make possible things not so held,
170: Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--
171: With what's unreal thou coactive art,
172: And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent
173: Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
174: And that beyond commission, and I find it,
175: And that to the infection of my brains
176: And hardening of my brows.
177: POLIXENES: What means Sicilia?
178: HERMIONE: He something seems unsettled.
179: POLIXENES: How, my lord!
180: What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?
181: HERMIONE: You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
182: Are you moved, my lord?
183: LEONTES: No, in good earnest.
184: How sometimes nature will betray its folly,
185: Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
186: To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
187: Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
188: Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
189: In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
190: Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
191: As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:
192: How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,
193: This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,
194: Will you take eggs for money?
195: MAMILLIUS: No, my lord, I'll fight.
196: LEONTES: You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,
197: Are you so fond of your young prince as we
198: Do seem to be of ours?
199: POLIXENES: If at home, sir,
200: He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,
201: Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,
202: My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
203: He makes a July's day short as December,
204: And with his varying childness cures in me
205: Thoughts that would thick my blood.
206: LEONTES: So stands this squire
207: Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,
208: And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,
209: How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;
210: Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
211: Next to thyself and my young rover, he's
212: Apparent to my heart.
213: HERMIONE: If you would seek us,
214: We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?
215: LEONTES: To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,
216: Be you beneath the sky.
217: I am angling now,
218: Though you perceive me not how I give line.
219: Go to, go to!
220: How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!
221: And arms her with the boldness of a wife
222: To her allowing husband!
223: Gone already!
224: Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and
225: ears a fork'd one!
226: Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I
227: Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue
228: Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
229: Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.
230: There have been,
231: Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;
232: And many a man there is, even at this present,
233: Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
234: That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
235: And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by
236: Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't
237: Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,
238: As mine, against their will. Should all despair
239: That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
240: Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;
241: It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
242: Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,
243: From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,
244: No barricado for a belly; know't;
245: It will let in and out the enemy
246: With bag and baggage: many thousand on's
247: Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!
248: MAMILLIUS: I am like you, they say.
249: LEONTES: Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?
250: CAMILLO: Ay, my good lord.
251: LEONTES: Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.
252: Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.
253: CAMILLO: You had much ado to make his anchor hold:
254: When you cast out, it still came home.
255: LEONTES: Didst note it?
256: CAMILLO: He would not stay at your petitions: made
257: His business more material.
258: LEONTES: Didst perceive it?
259: They're here with me already, whispering, rounding
260: 'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,
261: When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,
262: That he did stay?
263: CAMILLO: At the good queen's entreaty.
264: LEONTES: At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
265: But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken
266: By any understanding pate but thine?
267: For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
268: More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,
269: But of the finer natures? by some severals
270: Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
271: Perchance are to this business purblind? say.
272: CAMILLO: Business, my lord! I think most understand
273: Bohemia stays here longer.
274: LEONTES: Ha!
275: CAMILLO: Stays here longer.
276: LEONTES: Ay, but why?
277: CAMILLO: To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
278: Of our most gracious mistress.
279: LEONTES: Satisfy!
280: The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
281: Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
282: With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
283: My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
284: Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed
285: Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
286: Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
287: In that which seems so.
288: CAMILLO: Be it forbid, my lord!
289: LEONTES: To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,
290: If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,
291: Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
292: From course required; or else thou must be counted
293: A servant grafted in my serious trust
294: And therein negligent; or else a fool
295: That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
296: And takest it all for jest.
297: CAMILLO: My gracious lord,
298: I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;
299: In every one of these no man is free,
300: But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
301: Among the infinite doings of the world,
302: Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
303: If ever I were wilful-negligent,
304: It was my folly; if industriously
305: I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
306: Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
307: To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
308: Where of the execution did cry out
309: Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear
310: Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,
311: Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
312: Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,
313: Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
314: By its own visage: if I then deny it,
315: 'Tis none of mine.
316: LEONTES: Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--
317: But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass
318: Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
319: For to a vision so apparent rumour
320: Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
321: Resides not in that man that does not think,--
322: My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,
323: Or else be impudently negative,
324: To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say
325: My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name
326: As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
327: Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.
328: CAMILLO: I would not be a stander-by to hear
329: My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
330: My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,
331: You never spoke what did become you less
332: Than this; which to reiterate were sin
333: As deep as that, though true.
334: LEONTES: Is whispering nothing?
335: Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
336: Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
337: Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible
338: Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?
339: Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
340: Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes
341: Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
342: That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?
343: Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;
344: The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;
345: My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,
346: If this be nothing.
347: CAMILLO: Good my lord, be cured
348: Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;
349: For 'tis most dangerous.
350: LEONTES: Say it be, 'tis true.
351: CAMILLO: No, no, my lord.
352: LEONTES: It is; you lie, you lie:
353: I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,
354: Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
355: Or else a hovering temporizer, that
356: Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
357: Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver
358: Infected as her life, she would not live
359: The running of one glass.
360: CAMILLO: Who does infect her?
361: LEONTES: Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging
362: About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I
363: Had servants true about me, that bare eyes
364: To see alike mine honour as their profits,
365: Their own particular thrifts, they would do that
366: Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,
367: His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form
368: Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see
369: Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,
370: How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,
371: To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
372: Which draught to me were cordial.
373: CAMILLO: Sir, my lord,
374: I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
375: But with a lingering dram that should not work
376: Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
377: Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
378: So sovereignly being honourable.
379: I have loved thee,--
380: LEONTES: Make that thy question, and go rot!
381: Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
382: To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
383: The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
384: Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted
385: Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,
386: Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,
387: Who I do think is mine and love as mine,
388: Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
389: Could man so blench?
390: CAMILLO: I must believe you, sir:
391: I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;
392: Provided that, when he's removed, your highness
393: Will take again your queen as yours at first,
394: Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing
395: The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
396: Known and allied to yours.
397: LEONTES: Thou dost advise me
398: Even so as I mine own course have set down:
399: I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.
400: CAMILLO: My lord,
401: Go then; and with a countenance as clear
402: As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
403: And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:
404: If from me he have wholesome beverage,
405: Account me not your servant.
406: LEONTES: This is all:
407: Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;
408: Do't not, thou split'st thine own.
409: CAMILLO: I'll do't, my lord.
410: LEONTES: I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.
411: CAMILLO: O miserable lady! But, for me,
412: What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
413: Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't
414: Is the obedience to a master, one
415: Who in rebellion with himself will have
416: All that are his so too. To do this deed,
417: Promotion follows. If I could find example
418: Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
419: And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
420: Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,
421: Let villany itself forswear't. I must
422: Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain
423: To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
424: Here comes Bohemia.
425: POLIXENES: This is strange: methinks
426: My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
427: Good day, Camillo.
428: CAMILLO: Hail, most royal sir!
429: POLIXENES: What is the news i' the court?
430: CAMILLO: None rare, my lord.
431: POLIXENES: The king hath on him such a countenance
432: As he had lost some province and a region
433: Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him
434: With customary compliment; when he,
435: Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
436: A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and
437: So leaves me to consider what is breeding
438: That changeth thus his manners.
439: CAMILLO: I dare not know, my lord.
440: POLIXENES: How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?
441: Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
442: For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.
443: And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,
444: Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
445: Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be
446: A party in this alteration, finding
447: Myself thus alter'd with 't.
448: CAMILLO: There is a sickness
449: Which puts some of us in distemper, but
450: I cannot name the disease; and it is caught
451: Of you that yet are well.
452: POLIXENES: How! caught of me!
453: Make me not sighted like the basilisk:
454: I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better
455: By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--
456: As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
457: Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns
458: Our gentry than our parents' noble names,
459: In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,
460: If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
461: Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not
462: In ignorant concealment.
463: CAMILLO: I may not answer.
464: POLIXENES: A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!
465: I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,
466: I conjure thee, by all the parts of man
467: Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least
468: Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare
469: What incidency thou dost guess of harm
470: Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;
471: Which way to be prevented, if to be;
472: If not, how best to bear it.
473: CAMILLO: Sir, I will tell you;
474: Since I am charged in honour and by him
475: That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,
476: Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
477: I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
478: Cry lost, and so good night!
479: POLIXENES: On, good Camillo.
480: CAMILLO: I am appointed him to murder you.
481: POLIXENES: By whom, Camillo?
482: CAMILLO: By the king.
483: POLIXENES: For what?
484: CAMILLO: He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,
485: As he had seen't or been an instrument
486: To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen
487: Forbiddenly.
488: POLIXENES: O, then my best blood turn
489: To an infected jelly and my name
490: Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
491: Turn then my freshest reputation to
492: A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
493: Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,
494: Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection
495: That e'er was heard or read!
496: CAMILLO: Swear his thought over
497: By each particular star in heaven and
498: By all their influences, you may as well
499: Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
500: As or by oath remove or counsel shake
501: The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
502: Is piled upon his faith and will continue
503: The standing of his body.
504: POLIXENES: How should this grow?
505: CAMILLO: I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to
506: Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
507: If therefore you dare trust my honesty,
508: That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
509: Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!
510: Your followers I will whisper to the business,
511: And will by twos and threes at several posterns
512: Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put
513: My fortunes to your service, which are here
514: By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;
515: For, by the honour of my parents, I
516: Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,
517: I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer
518: Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon
519: His execution sworn.
520: POLIXENES: I do believe thee:
521: I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:
522: Be pilot to me and thy places shall
523: Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
524: My people did expect my hence departure
525: Two days ago. This jealousy
526: Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,
527: Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,
528: Must it be violent, and as he does conceive
529: He is dishonour'd by a man which ever
530: Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
531: In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
532: Good expedition be my friend, and comfort
533: The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
534: Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;
535: I will respect thee as a father if
536: Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.
ACT 2 SCENE 1

1: HERMIONE: Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
2: 'Tis past enduring.
3: First Lady: Come, my gracious lord,
4: Shall I be your playfellow?
5: MAMILLIUS: No, I'll none of you.
6: First Lady: Why, my sweet lord?
7: MAMILLIUS: You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
8: I were a baby still. I love you better.
9: Second Lady: And why so, my lord?
10: MAMILLIUS: Not for because
11: Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
12: Become some women best, so that there be not
13: Too much hair there, but in a semicircle
14: Or a half-moon made with a pen.
15: Second Lady: Who taught you this?
16: MAMILLIUS: I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
17: What colour are your eyebrows?
18: First Lady: Blue, my lord.
19: MAMILLIUS: Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose
20: That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.
21: First Lady: Hark ye;
22: The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall
23: Present our services to a fine new prince
24: One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,
25: If we would have you.
26: Second Lady: She is spread of late
27: Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!
28: HERMIONE: What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now
29: I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,
30: And tell 's a tale.
31: MAMILLIUS: Merry or sad shall't be?
32: HERMIONE: As merry as you will.
33: MAMILLIUS: A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
34: Of sprites and goblins.
35: HERMIONE: Let's have that, good sir.
36: Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best
37: To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.
38: MAMILLIUS: There was a man--
39: HERMIONE: Nay, come, sit down; then on.
40: MAMILLIUS: Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;
41: Yond crickets shall not hear it.
42: HERMIONE: Come on, then,
43: And give't me in mine ear.
44: LEONTES: Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?
45: First Lord: Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
46: Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them
47: Even to their ships.
48: LEONTES: How blest am I
49: In my just censure, in my true opinion!
50: Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
51: In being so blest! There may be in the cup
52: A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
53: And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
54: Is not infected: but if one present
55: The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
56: How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
57: With violent hefts. I have drunk,
58: and seen the spider.
59: Camillo was his help in this, his pander:
60: There is a plot against my life, my crown;
61: All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
62: Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:
63: He has discover'd my design, and I
64: Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
65: For them to play at will. How came the posterns
66: So easily open?
67: First Lord: By his great authority;
68: Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
69: On your command.
70: LEONTES: I know't too well.
71: Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
72: Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
73: Have too much blood in him.
74: HERMIONE: What is this? sport?
75: LEONTES: Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;
76: Away with him! and let her sport herself
77: With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes
78: Has made thee swell thus.
79: HERMIONE: But I'ld say he had not,
80: And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,
81: Howe'er you lean to the nayward.
82: LEONTES: You, my lords,
83: Look on her, mark her well; be but about
84: To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and
85: The justice of your bearts will thereto add
86: 'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'
87: Praise her but for this her without-door form,
88: Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight
89: The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
90: That calumny doth use--O, I am out--
91: That mercy does, for calumny will sear
92: Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,
93: When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between
94: Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
95: From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
96: She's an adulteress.
97: HERMIONE: Should a villain say so,
98: The most replenish'd villain in the world,
99: He were as much more villain: you, my lord,
100: Do but mistake.
101: LEONTES: You have mistook, my lady,
102: Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
103: Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,
104: Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
105: Should a like language use to all degrees
106: And mannerly distinguishment leave out
107: Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said
108: She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:
109: More, she's a traitor and Camillo is
110: A federary with her, and one that knows
111: What she should shame to know herself
112: But with her most vile principal, that she's
113: A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
114: That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy
115: To this their late escape.
116: HERMIONE: No, by my life.
117: Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,
118: When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that
119: You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
120: You scarce can right me throughly then to say
121: You did mistake.
122: LEONTES: No; if I mistake
123: In those foundations which I build upon,
124: The centre is not big enough to bear
125: A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
126: He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
127: But that he speaks.
128: HERMIONE: There's some ill planet reigns:
129: I must be patient till the heavens look
130: With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,
131: I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
132: Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
133: Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
134: That honourable grief lodged here which burns
135: Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,
136: With thoughts so qualified as your charities
137: Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
138: The king's will be perform'd!
139: LEONTES: Shall I be heard?
140: HERMIONE: Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,
141: My women may be with me; for you see
142: My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;
143: There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
144: Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
145: As I come out: this action I now go on
146: Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:
147: I never wish'd to see you sorry; now
148: I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.
149: LEONTES: Go, do our bidding; hence!
150: First Lord: Beseech your highness, call the queen again.
151: ANTIGONUS: Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice
152: Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,
153: Yourself, your queen, your son.
154: First Lord: For her, my lord,
155: I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,
156: Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless
157: I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,
158: In this which you accuse her.
159: ANTIGONUS: If it prove
160: She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where
161: I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;
162: Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;
163: For every inch of woman in the world,
164: Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.
165: LEONTES: Hold your peaces.
166: First Lord: Good my lord,--
167: ANTIGONUS: It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:
168: You are abused and by some putter-on
169: That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,
170: I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,
171: I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven
172: The second and the third, nine, and some five;
173: If this prove true, they'll pay for't:
174: by mine honour,
175: I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,
176: To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;
177: And I had rather glib myself than they
178: Should not produce fair issue.
179: LEONTES: Cease; no more.
180: You smell this business with a sense as cold
181: As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't
182: As you feel doing thus; and see withal
183: The instruments that feel.
184: ANTIGONUS: If it be so,
185: We need no grave to bury honesty:
186: There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
187: Of the whole dungy earth.
188: LEONTES: What! lack I credit?
189: First Lord: I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
190: Upon this ground; and more it would content me
191: To have her honour true than your suspicion,
192: Be blamed for't how you might.
193: LEONTES: Why, what need we
194: Commune with you of this, but rather follow
195: Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
196: Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
197: Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied
198: Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not
199: Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
200: We need no more of your advice: the matter,
201: The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all
202: Properly ours.
203: ANTIGONUS: And I wish, my liege,
204: You had only in your silent judgment tried it,
205: Without more overture.
206: LEONTES: How could that be?
207: Either thou art most ignorant by age,
208: Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
209: Added to their familiarity,
210: Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
211: That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation
212: But only seeing, all other circumstances
213: Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:
214: Yet, for a greater confirmation,
215: For in an act of this importance 'twere
216: Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post
217: To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
218: Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
219: Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle
220: They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,
221: Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?
222: First Lord: Well done, my lord.
223: LEONTES: Though I am satisfied and need no more
224: Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
225: Give rest to the minds of others, such as he
226: Whose ignorant credulity will not
227: Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good
228: From our free person she should be confined,
229: Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
230: Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;
231: We are to speak in public; for this business
232: Will raise us all.
233: ANTIGONUS: [Aside]
234: To laughter, as I take it,
235: If the good truth were known.
ACT 2 SCENE 2

1: PAULINA: The keeper of the prison, call to him;
2: let him have knowledge who I am.
3: Good lady,
4: No court in Europe is too good for thee;
5: What dost thou then in prison?
6: Now, good sir,
7: You know me, do you not?
8: Gaoler: For a worthy lady
9: And one whom much I honour.
10: PAULINA: Pray you then,
11: Conduct me to the queen.
12: Gaoler: I may not, madam:
13: To the contrary I have express commandment.
14: PAULINA: Here's ado,
15: To lock up honesty and honour from
16: The access of gentle visitors!
17: Is't lawful, pray you,
18: To see her women? any of them? Emilia?
19: Gaoler: So please you, madam,
20: To put apart these your attendants, I
21: Shall bring Emilia forth.
22: PAULINA: I pray now, call her.
23: Withdraw yourselves.
24: Gaoler: And, madam,
25: I must be present at your conference.
26: PAULINA: Well, be't so, prithee.
27: Here's such ado to make no stain a stain
28: As passes colouring.
29: Dear gentlewoman,
30: How fares our gracious lady?
31: EMILIA: As well as one so great and so forlorn
32: May hold together: on her frights and griefs,
33: Which never tender lady hath born greater,
34: She is something before her time deliver'd.
35: PAULINA: A boy?
36: EMILIA: A daughter, and a goodly babe,
37: Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
38: Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,
39: I am innocent as you.'
40: PAULINA: I dare be sworn
41: These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,
42: beshrew them!
43: He must be told on't, and he shall: the office
44: Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:
45: If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister
46: And never to my red-look'd anger be
47: The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,
48: Commend my best obedience to the queen:
49: If she dares trust me with her little babe,
50: I'll show't the king and undertake to be
51: Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know
52: How he may soften at the sight o' the child:
53: The silence often of pure innocence
54: Persuades when speaking fails.
55: EMILIA: Most worthy madam,
56: Your honour and your goodness is so evident
57: That your free undertaking cannot miss
58: A thriving issue: there is no lady living
59: So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship
60: To visit the next room, I'll presently
61: Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;
62: Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,
63: But durst not tempt a minister of honour,
64: Lest she should be denied.
65: PAULINA: Tell her, Emilia.
66: I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
67: As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted
68: I shall do good.
69: EMILIA: Now be you blest for it!
70: I'll to the queen: please you,
71: come something nearer.
72: Gaoler: Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,
73: I know not what I shall incur to pass it,
74: Having no warrant.
75: PAULINA: You need not fear it, sir:
76: This child was prisoner to the womb and is
77: By law and process of great nature thence
78: Freed and enfranchised, not a party to
79: The anger of the king nor guilty of,
80: If any be, the trespass of the queen.
81: Gaoler: I do believe it.
82: PAULINA: Do not you fear: upon mine honour,
83: I will stand betwixt you and danger.
ACT 2 SCENE 3

1: LEONTES: Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness
2: To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If
3: The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,
4: She the adulteress; for the harlot king
5: Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
6: And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she
7: I can hook to me: say that she were gone,
8: Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest
9: Might come to me again. Who's there?
10: First Servant: My lord?
11: LEONTES: How does the boy?
12: First Servant: He took good rest to-night;
13: 'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.
14: LEONTES: To see his nobleness!
15: Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,
16: He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,
17: Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,
18: Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
19: And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,
20: See how he fares.
21: Fie, fie! no thought of him:
22: The thought of my revenges that way
23: Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,
24: And in his parties, his alliance; let him be
25: Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,
26: Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
27: Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:
28: They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor
29: Shall she within my power.
30: First Lord: You must not enter.
31: PAULINA: Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:
32: Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
33: Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,
34: More free than he is jealous.
35: ANTIGONUS: That's enough.
36: Second Servant: Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded
37: None should come at him.
38: PAULINA: Not so hot, good sir:
39: I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,
40: That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
41: At each his needless heavings, such as you
42: Nourish the cause of his awaking: I
43: Do come with words as medicinal as true,
44: Honest as either, to purge him of that humour
45: That presses him from sleep.
46: LEONTES: What noise there, ho?
47: PAULINA: No noise, my lord; but needful conference
48: About some gossips for your highness.
49: LEONTES: How!
50: Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,
51: I charged thee that she should not come about me:
52: I knew she would.
53: ANTIGONUS: I told her so, my lord,
54: On your displeasure's peril and on mine,
55: She should not visit you.
56: LEONTES: What, canst not rule her?
57: PAULINA: From all dishonesty he can: in this,
58: Unless he take the course that you have done,
59: Commit me for committing honour, trust it,
60: He shall not rule me.
61: ANTIGONUS: La you now, you hear:
62: When she will take the rein I let her run;
63: But she'll not stumble.
64: PAULINA: Good my liege, I come;
65: And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess
66: Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
67: Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare
68: Less appear so in comforting your evils,
69: Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come
70: From your good queen.
71: LEONTES: Good queen!
72: PAULINA: Good queen, my lord,
73: Good queen; I say good queen;
74: And would by combat make her good, so were I
75: A man, the worst about you.
76: LEONTES: Force her hence.
77: PAULINA: Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
78: First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;
79: But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,
80: For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;
81: Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.
82: LEONTES: Out!
83: A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:
84: A most intelligencing bawd!
85: PAULINA: Not so:
86: I am as ignorant in that as you
87: In so entitling me, and no less honest
88: Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,
89: As this world goes, to pass for honest.
90: LEONTES: Traitors!
91: Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.
92: Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted
93: By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;
94: Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.
95: PAULINA: For ever
96: Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
97: Takest up the princess by that forced baseness
98: Which he has put upon't!
99: LEONTES: He dreads his wife.
100: PAULINA: So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
101: You'ld call your children yours.
102: LEONTES: A nest of traitors!
103: ANTIGONUS: I am none, by this good light.
104: PAULINA: Nor I, nor any
105: But one that's here, and that's himself, for he
106: The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
107: His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,
108: Whose sting is sharper than the sword's;
109: and will not--
110: For, as the case now stands, it is a curse
111: He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
112: The root of his opinion, which is rotten
113: As ever oak or stone was sound.
114: LEONTES: A callat
115: Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband
116: And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;
117: It is the issue of Polixenes:
118: Hence with it, and together with the dam
119: Commit them to the fire!
120: PAULINA: It is yours;
121: And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,
122: So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
123: Although the print be little, the whole matter
124: And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,
125: The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
126: The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,
127: His smiles,
128: The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:
129: And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
130: So like to him that got it, if thou hast
131: The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours
132: No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,
133: Her children not her husband's!
134: LEONTES: A gross hag
135: And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,
136: That wilt not stay her tongue.
137: ANTIGONUS: Hang all the husbands
138: That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself
139: Hardly one subject.
140: LEONTES: Once more, take her hence.
141: PAULINA: A most unworthy and unnatural lord
142: Can do no more.
143: LEONTES: I'll ha' thee burnt.
144: PAULINA: I care not:
145: It is an heretic that makes the fire,
146: Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;
147: But this most cruel usage of your queen,
148: Not able to produce more accusation
149: Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours
150: Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
151: Yea, scandalous to the world.
152: LEONTES: On your allegiance,
153: Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
154: Where were her life? she durst not call me so,
155: If she did know me one. Away with her!
156: PAULINA: I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.
157: Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:
158: Jove send her
159: A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
160: You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,
161: Will never do him good, not one of you.
162: So, so: farewell; we are gone.
163: LEONTES: Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.
164: My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
165: A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence
166: And see it instantly consumed with fire;
167: Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:
168: Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,
169: And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,
170: With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse
171: And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;
172: The bastard brains with these my proper hands
173: Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;
174: For thou set'st on thy wife.
175: ANTIGONUS: I did not, sir:
176: These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,
177: Can clear me in't.
178: Lords: We can: my royal liege,
179: He is not guilty of her coming hither.
180: LEONTES: You're liars all.
181: First Lord: Beseech your highness, give us better credit:
182: We have always truly served you, and beseech you
183: So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,
184: As recompense of our dear services
185: Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,
186: Which being so horrible, so bloody, must
187: Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.
188: LEONTES: I am a feather for each wind that blows:
189: Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
190: And call me father? better burn it now
191: Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.
192: It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;
193: You that have been so tenderly officious
194: With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
195: To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,
196: So sure as this beard's grey,
197: --what will you adventure
198: To save this brat's life?
199: ANTIGONUS: Any thing, my lord,
200: That my ability may undergo
201: And nobleness impose: at least thus much:
202: I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
203: To save the innocent: any thing possible.
204: LEONTES: It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
205: Thou wilt perform my bidding.
206: ANTIGONUS: I will, my lord.
207: LEONTES: Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail
208: Of any point in't shall not only be
209: Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,
210: Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,
211: As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry
212: This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
213: To some remote and desert place quite out
214: Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,
215: Without more mercy, to its own protection
216: And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune
217: It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,
218: On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,
219: That thou commend it strangely to some place
220: Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.
221: ANTIGONUS: I swear to do this, though a present death
222: Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:
223: Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
224: To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say
225: Casting their savageness aside have done
226: Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous
227: In more than this deed does require! And blessing
228: Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
229: Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!
230: LEONTES: No, I'll not rear
231: Another's issue.
232: Servant: Please your highness, posts
233: From those you sent to the oracle are come
234: An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,
235: Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,
236: Hasting to the court.
237: First Lord: So please you, sir, their speed
238: Hath been beyond account.
ACT 3 SCENE 1

1: CLEOMENES: The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,
2: Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing
3: The common praise it bears.
4: DION: I shall report,
5: For most it caught me, the celestial habits,
6: Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence
7: Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!
8: How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly
9: It was i' the offering!
10: CLEOMENES: But of all, the burst
11: And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,
12: Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.
13: That I was nothing.
14: DION: If the event o' the journey
15: Prove as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--
16: As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,
17: The time is worth the use on't.
18: CLEOMENES: Great Apollo
19: Turn all to the best! These proclamations,
20: So forcing faults upon Hermione,
21: I little like.
22: DION: The violent carriage of it
23: Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,
24: Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,
25: Shall the contents discover, something rare
26: Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!
27: And gracious be the issue!
ACT 3 SCENE 2

1: LEONTES: This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,
2: Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried
3: The daughter of a king, our wife, and one
4: Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd
5: Of being tyrannous, since we so openly
6: Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,
7: Even to the guilt or the purgation.
8: Produce the prisoner.
9: Officer: It is his highness' pleasure that the queen
10: Appear in person here in court. Silence!
11: LEONTES: Read the indictment.
12: Officer: [Reads] Hermione, queen to the worthy
13: Leontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused and
14: arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery
15: with Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiring
16: with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign
17: lord the king, thy royal husband: the pretence
18: whereof being by circumstances partly laid open,
19: thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance
20: of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for
21: their better safety, to fly away by night.
22: HERMIONE: Since what I am to say must be but that
23: Which contradicts my accusation and
24: The testimony on my part no other
25: But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me
26: To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity
27: Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,
28: Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
29: Behold our human actions, as they do,
30: I doubt not then but innocence shall make
31: False accusation blush and tyranny
32: Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,
33: Who least will seem to do so, my past life
34: Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
35: As I am now unhappy; which is more
36: Than history can pattern, though devised
37: And play'd to take spectators. For behold me
38: A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
39: A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,
40: The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing
41: To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore
42: Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it
43: As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,
44: 'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
45: And only that I stand for. I appeal
46: To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes
47: Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
48: How merited to be so; since he came,
49: With what encounter so uncurrent I
50: Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond
51: The bound of honour, or in act or will
52: That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts
53: Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin
54: Cry fie upon my grave!
55: LEONTES: I ne'er heard yet
56: That any of these bolder vices wanted
57: Less impudence to gainsay what they did
58: Than to perform it first.
59: HERMIONE: That's true enough;
60: Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.
61: LEONTES: You will not own it.
62: HERMIONE: More than mistress of
63: Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not
64: At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,
65: With whom I am accused, I do confess
66: I loved him as in honour he required,
67: With such a kind of love as might become
68: A lady like me, with a love even such,
69: So and no other, as yourself commanded:
70: Which not to have done I think had been in me
71: Both disobedience and ingratitude
72: To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,
73: Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely
74: That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,
75: I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd
76: For me to try how: all I know of it
77: Is that Camillo was an honest man;
78: And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
79: Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.
80: LEONTES: You knew of his departure, as you know
81: What you have underta'en to do in's absence.
82: HERMIONE: Sir,
83: You speak a language that I understand not:
84: My life stands in the level of your dreams,
85: Which I'll lay down.
86: LEONTES: Your actions are my dreams;
87: You had a bastard by Polixenes,
88: And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--
89: Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:
90: Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
91: Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
92: No father owning it,--which is, indeed,
93: More criminal in thee than it,--so thou
94: Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage
95: Look for no less than death.
96: HERMIONE: Sir, spare your threats:
97: The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
98: To me can life be no commodity:
99: The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,
100: I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,
101: But know not how it went. My second joy
102: And first-fruits of my body, from his presence
103: I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort
104: Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,
105: The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,
106: Haled out to murder: myself on every post
107: Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred
108: The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs
109: To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
110: Here to this place, i' the open air, before
111: I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
112: Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
113: That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.
114: But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,
115: I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,
116: Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd
117: Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
118: But what your jealousies awake, I tell you
119: 'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,
120: I do refer me to the oracle:
121: Apollo be my judge!
122: First Lord: This your request
123: Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,
124: And in Apollos name, his oracle.
125: HERMIONE: The Emperor of Russia was my father:
126: O that he were alive, and here beholding
127: His daughter's trial! that he did but see
128: The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes
129: Of pity, not revenge!
130: Officer: You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,
131: That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have
132: Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought
133: The seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd
134: Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,
135: You have not dared to break the holy seal
136: Nor read the secrets in't.
137: DION: All this we swear.
138: LEONTES: Break up the seals and read.
139: Officer: [Reads] Hermione is chaste;
140: Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontes
141: a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten;
142: and the king shall live without an heir, if that
143: which is lost be not found.
144: Lords: Now blessed be the great Apollo!
145: HERMIONE: Praised!
146: LEONTES: Hast thou read truth?
147: Officer: Ay, my lord; even so
148: As it is here set down.
149: LEONTES: There is no truth at all i' the oracle:
150: The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.
151: Servant: My lord the king, the king!
152: LEONTES: What is the business?
153: Servant: O sir, I shall be hated to report it!
154: The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear
155: Of the queen's speed, is gone.
156: LEONTES: How! gone!
157: Servant: Is dead.
158: LEONTES: Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves
159: Do strike at my injustice.
160: How now there!
161: PAULINA: This news is mortal to the queen: look down
162: And see what death is doing.
163: LEONTES: Take her hence:
164: Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:
165: I have too much believed mine own suspicion:
166: Beseech you, tenderly apply to her
167: Some remedies for life.
168: Apollo, pardon
169: My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
170: I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
171: New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,
172: Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;
173: For, being transported by my jealousies
174: To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose
175: Camillo for the minister to poison
176: My friend Polixenes: which had been done,
177: But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
178: My swift command, though I with death and with
179: Reward did threaten and encourage him,
180: Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane
181: And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest
182: Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,
183: Which you knew great, and to the hazard
184: Of all encertainties himself commended,
185: No richer than his honour: how he glisters
186: Thorough my rust! and how his pity
187: Does my deeds make the blacker!
188: PAULINA: Woe the while!
189: O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
190: Break too.
191: First Lord: What fit is this, good lady?
192: PAULINA: What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
193: What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
194: In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
195: Must I receive, whose every word deserves
196: To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
197: Together working with thy jealousies,
198: Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
199: For girls of nine, O, think what they have done
200: And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all
201: Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
202: That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;
203: That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant
204: And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,
205: Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,
206: To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
207: More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
208: The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
209: To be or none or little; though a devil
210: Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:
211: Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death
212: Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,
213: Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart
214: That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
215: Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,
216: Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,
217: When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,
218: The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,
219: and vengeance for't
220: Not dropp'd down yet.
221: First Lord: The higher powers forbid!
222: PAULINA: I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
223: Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring
224: Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,
225: Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you
226: As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
227: Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
228: Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee
229: To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
230: Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
231: Upon a barren mountain and still winter
232: In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
233: To look that way thou wert.
234: LEONTES: Go on, go on
235: Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved
236: All tongues to talk their bitterest.
237: First Lord: Say no more:
238: Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault
239: I' the boldness of your speech.
240: PAULINA: I am sorry for't:
241: All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
242: I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much
243: The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd
244: To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help
245: Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
246: At my petition; I beseech you, rather
247: Let me be punish'd, that have minded you
248: Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege
249: Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:
250: The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--
251: I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;
252: I'll not remember you of my own lord,
253: Who is lost too: take your patience to you,
254: And I'll say nothing.
255: LEONTES: Thou didst speak but well
256: When most the truth; which I receive much better
257: Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me
258: To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
259: One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
260: The causes of their death appear, unto
261: Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
262: The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there
263: Shall be my recreation: so long as nature
264: Will bear up with this exercise, so long
265: I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
266: Unto these sorrows.
ACT 3 SCENE 3

1: ANTIGONUS: Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
2: The deserts of Bohemia?
3: Mariner: Ay, my lord: and fear
4: We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly
5: And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,
6: The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
7: And frown upon 's.
8: ANTIGONUS: Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
9: Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
10: I call upon thee.
11: Mariner: Make your best haste, and go not
12: Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;
13: Besides, this place is famous for the creatures
14: Of prey that keep upon't.
15: ANTIGONUS: Go thou away:
16: I'll follow instantly.
17: Mariner: I am glad at heart
18: To be so rid o' the business.
19: ANTIGONUS: Come, poor babe:
20: I have heard, but not believed,
21: the spirits o' the dead
22: May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother
23: Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream
24: So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
25: Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
26: I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
27: So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,
28: Like very sanctity, she did approach
29: My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,
30: And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
31: Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
32: Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,
33: Since fate, against thy better disposition,
34: Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
35: Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
36: Places remote enough are in Bohemia,
37: There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe
38: Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,
39: I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business
40: Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
41: Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks
42: She melted into air. Affrighted much,
43: I did in time collect myself and thought
44: This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
45: Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,
46: I will be squared by this. I do believe
47: Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that
48: Apollo would, this being indeed the issue
49: Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
50: Either for life or death, upon the earth
51: Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!
52: There lie, and there thy character: there these;
53: Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
54: And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,
55: That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
56: To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,
57: But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I
58: To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
59: The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have
60: A lullaby too rough: I never saw
61: The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
62: Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
63: I am gone for ever.
64: Shepherd: I would there were no age between sixteen and
65: three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the
66: rest; for there is nothing in the between but
67: getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,
68: stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but
69: these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
70: hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my
71: best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find
72: than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by
73: the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy
74: will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very
75: pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A
76: pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:
77: though I am not bookish, yet I can read
78: waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been
79: some stair-work, some trunk-work, some
80: behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this
81: than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for
82: pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed
83: but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!
84: Clown: Hilloa, loa!
85: Shepherd: What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk
86: on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What
87: ailest thou, man?
88: Clown: I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!
89: but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the
90: sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust
91: a bodkin's point.
92: Shepherd: Why, boy, how is it?
93: Clown: I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,
94: how it takes up the shore! but that's not the
95: point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!
96: sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the
97: ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon
98: swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a
99: cork into a hogshead. And then for the
100: land-service, to see how the bear tore out his
101: shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said
102: his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an
103: end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned
104: it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the
105: sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared
106: and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than
107: the sea or weather.
108: Shepherd: Name of mercy, when was this, boy?
109: Clown: Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these
110: sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor
111: the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it
112: now.
113: Shepherd: Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!
114: Clown: I would you had been by the ship side, to have
115: helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.
116: Shepherd: Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,
117: boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things
118: dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for
119: thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's
120: child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;
121: open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be
122: rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:
123: open't. What's within, boy?
124: Clown: You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth
125: are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!
126: Shepherd: This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up
127: with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.
128: We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires
129: nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good
130: boy, the next way home.
131: Clown: Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see
132: if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much
133: he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they
134: are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury
135: it.
136: Shepherd: That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that
137: which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the
138: sight of him.
139: Clown: Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.
140: Shepherd: 'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.
141: SCENE I:
142: Time: I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror
143: Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,
144: Now take upon me, in the name of Time,
145: To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
146: To me or my swift passage, that I slide
147: O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried
148: Of that wide gap, since it is in my power
149: To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour
150: To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass
151: The same I am, ere ancient'st order was
152: Or what is now received: I witness to
153: The times that brought them in; so shall I do
154: To the freshest things now reigning and make stale
155: The glistering of this present, as my tale
156: Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,
157: I turn my glass and give my scene such growing
158: As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,
159: The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
160: That he shuts up himself, imagine me,
161: Gentle spectators, that I now may be
162: In fair Bohemia, and remember well,
163: I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel
164: I now name to you; and with speed so pace
165: To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace
166: Equal with wondering: what of her ensues
167: I list not prophecy; but let Time's news
168: Be known when 'tis brought forth.
169: A shepherd's daughter,
170: And what to her adheres, which follows after,
171: Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,
172: If ever you have spent time worse ere now;
173: If never, yet that Time himself doth say
174: He wishes earnestly you never may.
ACT 4 SCENE 2

1: POLIXENES: I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:
2: 'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to
3: grant this.
4: CAMILLO: It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though
5: I have for the most part been aired abroad, I
6: desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent
7: king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling
8: sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to
9: think so, which is another spur to my departure.
10: POLIXENES: As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of
11: thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of
12: thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to
13: have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having
14: made me businesses which none without thee can
15: sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute
16: them thyself or take away with thee the very
17: services thou hast done; which if I have not enough
18: considered, as too much I cannot, to be more
19: thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit
20: therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal
21: country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very
22: naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
23: penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,
24: my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen
25: and children are even now to be afresh lamented.
26: Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my
27: son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not
28: being gracious, than they are in losing them when
29: they have approved their virtues.
30: CAMILLO: Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What
31: his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I
32: have missingly noted, he is of late much retired
33: from court and is less frequent to his princely
34: exercises than formerly he hath appeared.
35: POLIXENES: I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some
36: care; so far that I have eyes under my service which
37: look upon his removedness; from whom I have this
38: intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a
39: most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from
40: very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his
41: neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.
42: CAMILLO: I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a
43: daughter of most rare note: the report of her is
44: extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.
45: POLIXENES: That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I
46: fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou
47: shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not
48: appearing what we are, have some question with the
49: shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not
50: uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.
51: Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and
52: lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.
53: CAMILLO: I willingly obey your command.
54: POLIXENES: My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.
ACT 4 SCENE 3

1: AUTOLYCUS: When daffodils begin to peer,
2: With heigh! the doxy over the dale,
3: Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;
4: For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.
5: The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,
6: With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!
7: Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;
8: For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.
9: The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,
10: With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,
11: Are summer songs for me and my aunts,
12: While we lie tumbling in the hay.
13: I have served Prince Florizel and in my time
14: wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:
15: But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?
16: The pale moon shines by night:
17: And when I wander here and there,
18: I then do most go right.
19: If tinkers may have leave to live,
20: And bear the sow-skin budget,
21: Then my account I well may, give,
22: And in the stocks avouch it.
23: My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to
24: lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who
25: being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise
26: a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and
27: drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is
28: the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful
29: on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to
30: me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought
31: of it. A prize! a prize!
32: Clown: Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod
33: yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred
34: shorn. what comes the wool to?
35: AUTOLYCUS: [Aside]
36: If the springe hold, the cock's mine.
37: Clown: I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am
38: I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
39: of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will
40: this sister of mine do with rice? But my father
41: hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it
42: on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for
43: the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good
44: ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but
45: one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to
46: horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden
47: pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;
48: nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I
49: may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of
50: raisins o' the sun.
51: AUTOLYCUS: O that ever I was born!
52: Clown: I' the name of me--
53: AUTOLYCUS: O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and
54: then, death, death!
55: Clown: Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay
56: on thee, rather than have these off.
57: AUTOLYCUS: O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more
58: than the stripes I have received, which are mighty
59: ones and millions.
60: Clown: Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a
61: great matter.
62: AUTOLYCUS: I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel
63: ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon
64: me.
65: Clown: What, by a horseman, or a footman?
66: AUTOLYCUS: A footman, sweet sir, a footman.
67: Clown: Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he
68: has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,
69: it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,
70: I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.
71: AUTOLYCUS: O, good sir, tenderly, O!
72: Clown: Alas, poor soul!
73: AUTOLYCUS: O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my
74: shoulder-blade is out.
75: Clown: How now! canst stand?
76: AUTOLYCUS: [Picking his pocket]
77: Softly, dear sir; good sir, softly. You ha' done me
78: a charitable office.
79: Clown: Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.
80: AUTOLYCUS: No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have
81: a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,
82: unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or
83: any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;
84: that kills my heart.
85: Clown: What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?
86: AUTOLYCUS: A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with
87: troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the
88: prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his
89: virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.
90: Clown: His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped
91: out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay
92: there; and yet it will no more but abide.
93: AUTOLYCUS: Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he
94: hath been since an ape-bearer; then a
95: process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a
96: motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's
97: wife within a mile where my land and living lies;
98: and, having flown over many knavish professions, he
99: settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.
100: Clown: Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts
101: wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.
102: AUTOLYCUS: Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that
103: put me into this apparel.
104: Clown: Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had
105: but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.
106: AUTOLYCUS: I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am
107: false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant
108: him.
109: Clown: How do you now?
110: AUTOLYCUS: Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and
111: walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace
112: softly towards my kinsman's.
113: Clown: Shall I bring thee on the way?
114: AUTOLYCUS: No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.
115: Clown: Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our
116: sheep-shearing.
117: AUTOLYCUS: Prosper you, sweet sir!
118: Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.
119: I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I
120: make not this cheat bring out another and the
121: shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name
122: put in the book of virtue!
123: Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,
124: And merrily hent the stile-a:
125: A merry heart goes all the day,
126: Your sad tires in a mile-a.
ACT 4 SCENE 4

1: FLORIZEL: These your unusual weeds to each part of you
2: Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora
3: Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing
4: Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
5: And you the queen on't.
6: PERDITA: Sir, my gracious lord,
7: To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:
8: O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
9: The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured
10: With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,
11: Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts
12: In every mess have folly and the feeders
13: Digest it with a custom, I should blush
14: To see you so attired, sworn, I think,
15: To show myself a glass.
16: FLORIZEL: I bless the time
17: When my good falcon made her flight across
18: Thy father's ground.
19: PERDITA: Now Jove afford you cause!
20: To me the difference forges dread; your greatness
21: Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
22: To think your father, by some accident,
23: Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
24: How would he look, to see his work so noble
25: Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
26: Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
27: The sternness of his presence?
28: FLORIZEL: Apprehend
29: Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
30: Humbling their deities to love, have taken
31: The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
32: Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune
33: A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,
34: Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
35: As I seem now. Their transformations
36: Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,
37: Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
38: Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts
39: Burn hotter than my faith.
40: PERDITA: O, but, sir,
41: Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
42: Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:
43: One of these two must be necessities,
44: Which then will speak, that you must
45: change this purpose,
46: Or I my life.
47: FLORIZEL: Thou dearest Perdita,
48: With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not
49: The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,
50: Or not my father's. For I cannot be
51: Mine own, nor any thing to any, if
52: I be not thine. To this I am most constant,
53: Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;
54: Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
55: That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:
56: Lift up your countenance, as it were the day
57: Of celebration of that nuptial which
58: We two have sworn shall come.
59: PERDITA: O lady Fortune,
60: Stand you auspicious!
61: FLORIZEL: See, your guests approach:
62: Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
63: And let's be red with mirth.
64: Shepherd: Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon
65: This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,
66: Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;
67: Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,
68: At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;
69: On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire
70: With labour and the thing she took to quench it,
71: She would to each one sip. You are retired,
72: As if you were a feasted one and not
73: The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid
74: These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is
75: A way to make us better friends, more known.
76: Come, quench your blushes and present yourself
77: That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,
78: And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
79: As your good flock shall prosper.
80: PERDITA: [To POLIXENES] Sir, welcome:
81: It is my father's will I should take on me
82: The hostess-ship o' the day.
83: You're welcome, sir.
84: Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,
85: For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep
86: Seeming and savour all the winter long:
87: Grace and remembrance be to you both,
88: And welcome to our shearing!
89: POLIXENES: Shepherdess,
90: A fair one are you--well you fit our ages
91: With flowers of winter.
92: PERDITA: Sir, the year growing ancient,
93: Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
94: Of trembling winter, the fairest
95: flowers o' the season
96: Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,
97: Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind
98: Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not
99: To get slips of them.
100: POLIXENES: Wherefore, gentle maiden,
101: Do you neglect them?
102: PERDITA: For I have heard it said
103: There is an art which in their piedness shares
104: With great creating nature.
105: POLIXENES: Say there be;
106: Yet nature is made better by no mean
107: But nature makes that mean: so, over that art
108: Which you say adds to nature, is an art
109: That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
110: A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
111: And make conceive a bark of baser kind
112: By bud of nobler race: this is an art
113: Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
114: The art itself is nature.
115: PERDITA: So it is.
116: POLIXENES: Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,
117: And do not call them bastards.
118: PERDITA: I'll not put
119: The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
120: No more than were I painted I would wish
121: This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore
122: Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
123: Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;
124: The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
125: And with him rises weeping: these are flowers
126: Of middle summer, and I think they are given
127: To men of middle age. You're very welcome.
128: CAMILLO: I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,
129: And only live by gazing.
130: PERDITA: Out, alas!
131: You'd be so lean, that blasts of January
132: Would blow you through and through.
133: Now, my fair'st friend,
134: I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might
135: Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,
136: That wear upon your virgin branches yet
137: Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,
138: For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall
139: From Dis's waggon! daffodils,
140: That come before the swallow dares, and take
141: The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,
142: But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
143: Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses
144: That die unmarried, ere they can behold
145: Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady
146: Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
147: The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
148: The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,
149: To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,
150: To strew him o'er and o'er!
151: FLORIZEL: What, like a corse?
152: PERDITA: No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;
153: Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,
154: But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:
155: Methinks I play as I have seen them do
156: In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
157: Does change my disposition.
158: FLORIZEL: What you do
159: Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.
160: I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,
161: I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,
162: Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,
163: To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you
164: A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do
165: Nothing but that; move still, still so,
166: And own no other function: each your doing,
167: So singular in each particular,
168: Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,
169: That all your acts are queens.
170: PERDITA: O Doricles,
171: Your praises are too large: but that your youth,
172: And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,
173: Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,
174: With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,
175: You woo'd me the false way.
176: FLORIZEL: I think you have
177: As little skill to fear as I have purpose
178: To put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:
179: Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,
180: That never mean to part.
181: PERDITA: I'll swear for 'em.
182: POLIXENES: This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
183: Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems
184: But smacks of something greater than herself,
185: Too noble for this place.
186: CAMILLO: He tells her something
187: That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is
188: The queen of curds and cream.
189: Clown: Come on, strike up!
190: DORCAS: Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,
191: To mend her kissing with!
192: MOPSA: Now, in good time!
193: Clown: Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.
194: Come, strike up!
195: POLIXENES: Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this
196: Which dances with your daughter?
197: Shepherd: They call him Doricles; and boasts himself
198: To have a worthy feeding: but I have it
199: Upon his own report and I believe it;
200: He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:
201: I think so too; for never gazed the moon
202: Upon the water as he'll stand and read
203: As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.
204: I think there is not half a kiss to choose
205: Who loves another best.
206: POLIXENES: She dances featly.
207: Shepherd: So she does any thing; though I report it,
208: That should be silent: if young Doricles
209: Do light upon her, she shall bring him that
210: Which he not dreams of.
211: Servant: O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the
212: door, you would never dance again after a tabour and
213: pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings
214: several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he
215: utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's
216: ears grew to his tunes.
217: Clown: He could never come better; he shall come in. I
218: love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful
219: matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing
220: indeed and sung lamentably.
221: Servant: He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no
222: milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he
223: has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without
224: bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate
225: burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump
226: her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,
227: as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into
228: the matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me
229: no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with
230: 'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'
231: POLIXENES: This is a brave fellow.
232: Clown: Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited
233: fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?
234: Servant: He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;
235: points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can
236: learnedly handle, though they come to him by the
237: gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he
238: sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you
239: would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants
240: to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.
241: Clown: Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.
242: PERDITA: Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.
243: Clown: You have of these pedlars, that have more in them
244: than you'ld think, sister.
245: PERDITA: Ay, good brother, or go about to think.
246: AUTOLYCUS: Lawn as white as driven snow;
247: Cyprus black as e'er was crow;
248: Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
249: Masks for faces and for noses;
250: Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,
251: Perfume for a lady's chamber;
252: Golden quoifs and stomachers,
253: For my lads to give their dears:
254: Pins and poking-sticks of steel,
255: What maids lack from head to heel:
256: Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;
257: Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.
258: Clown: If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take
259: no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it
260: will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.
261: MOPSA: I was promised them against the feast; but they come
262: not too late now.
263: DORCAS: He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.
264: MOPSA: He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has
265: paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.
266: Clown: Is there no manners left among maids? will they
267: wear their plackets where they should bear their
268: faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are
269: going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
270: secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all
271: our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour
272: your tongues, and not a word more.
273: MOPSA: I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace
274: and a pair of sweet gloves.
275: Clown: Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
276: and lost all my money?
277: AUTOLYCUS: And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;
278: therefore it behoves men to be wary.
279: Clown: Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.
280: AUTOLYCUS: I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.
281: Clown: What hast here? ballads?
282: MOPSA: Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'
283: life, for then we are sure they are true.
284: AUTOLYCUS: Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's
285: wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a
286: burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and
287: toads carbonadoed.
288: MOPSA: Is it true, think you?
289: AUTOLYCUS: Very true, and but a month old.
290: DORCAS: Bless me from marrying a usurer!
291: AUTOLYCUS: Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress
292: Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were
293: present. Why should I carry lies abroad?
294: MOPSA: Pray you now, buy it.
295: Clown: Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe
296: ballads; we'll buy the other things anon.
297: AUTOLYCUS: Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon
298: the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,
299: forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this
300: ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was
301: thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold
302: fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that
303: loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.
304: DORCAS: Is it true too, think you?
305: AUTOLYCUS: Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than
306: my pack will hold.
307: Clown: Lay it by too: another.
308: AUTOLYCUS: This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.
309: MOPSA: Let's have some merry ones.
310: AUTOLYCUS: Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to
311: the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's
312: scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in
313: request, I can tell you.
314: MOPSA: We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou
315: shalt hear; 'tis in three parts.
316: DORCAS: We had the tune on't a month ago.
317: AUTOLYCUS: I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my
318: occupation; have at it with you.
319: Get you hence, for I must go
320: Where it fits not you to know.
321: DORCAS: Whither?
322: MOPSA: O, whither?
323: DORCAS: Whither?
324: MOPSA: It becomes thy oath full well,
325: Thou to me thy secrets tell.
326: DORCAS: Me too, let me go thither.
327: MOPSA: Or thou goest to the orange or mill.
328: DORCAS: If to either, thou dost ill.
329: AUTOLYCUS: Neither.
330: DORCAS: What, neither?
331: AUTOLYCUS: Neither.
332: DORCAS: Thou hast sworn my love to be.
333: MOPSA: Thou hast sworn it more to me:
334: Then whither goest? say, whither?
335: Clown: We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my
336: father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll
337: not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after
338: me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's
339: have the first choice. Follow me, girls.
340: AUTOLYCUS: And you shall pay well for 'em.
341: Will you buy any tape,
342: Or lace for your cape,
343: My dainty duck, my dear-a?
344: Any silk, any thread,
345: Any toys for your head,
346: Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?
347: Come to the pedlar;
348: Money's a medler.
349: That doth utter all men's ware-a.
350: Servant: Master, there is three carters, three shepherds,
351: three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made
352: themselves all men of hair, they call themselves
353: Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches
354: say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are
355: not in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if it
356: be not too rough for some that know little but
357: bowling, it will please plentifully.
358: Shepherd: Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much
359: homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.
360: POLIXENES: You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see
361: these four threes of herdsmen.
362: Servant: One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath
363: danced before the king; and not the worst of the
364: three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.
365: Shepherd: Leave your prating: since these good men are
366: pleased, let them come in; but quickly now.
367: Servant: Why, they stay at door, sir.
368: POLIXENES: O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.
369: Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.
370: He's simple and tells much.
371: How now, fair shepherd!
372: Your heart is full of something that does take
373: Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
374: And handed love as you do, I was wont
375: To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
376: The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
377: To her acceptance; you have let him go
378: And nothing marted with him. If your lass
379: Interpretation should abuse and call this
380: Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
381: For a reply, at least if you make a care
382: Of happy holding her.
383: FLORIZEL: Old sir, I know
384: She prizes not such trifles as these are:
385: The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
386: Up in my heart; which I have given already,
387: But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life
388: Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,
389: Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,
390: As soft as dove's down and as white as it,
391: Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd
392: snow that's bolted
393: By the northern blasts twice o'er.
394: POLIXENES: What follows this?
395: How prettily the young swain seems to wash
396: The hand was fair before! I have put you out:
397: But to your protestation; let me hear
398: What you profess.
399: FLORIZEL: Do, and be witness to 't.
400: POLIXENES: And this my neighbour too?
401: FLORIZEL: And he, and more
402: Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:
403: That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,
404: Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth
405: That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
406: More than was ever man's, I would not prize them
407: Without her love; for her employ them all;
408: Commend them and condemn them to her service
409: Or to their own perdition.
410: POLIXENES: Fairly offer'd.
411: CAMILLO: This shows a sound affection.
412: Shepherd: But, my daughter,
413: Say you the like to him?
414: PERDITA: I cannot speak
415: So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:
416: By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
417: The purity of his.
418: Shepherd: Take hands, a bargain!
419: And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:
420: I give my daughter to him, and will make
421: Her portion equal his.
422: FLORIZEL: O, that must be
423: I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,
424: I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
425: Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
426: Contract us 'fore these witnesses.
427: Shepherd: Come, your hand;
428: And, daughter, yours.
429: POLIXENES: Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;
430: Have you a father?
431: FLORIZEL: I have: but what of him?
432: POLIXENES: Knows he of this?
433: FLORIZEL: He neither does nor shall.
434: POLIXENES: Methinks a father
435: Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
436: That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,
437: Is not your father grown incapable
438: Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
439: With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
440: Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
441: Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
442: But what he did being childish?
443: FLORIZEL: No, good sir;
444: He has his health and ampler strength indeed
445: Than most have of his age.
446: POLIXENES: By my white beard,
447: You offer him, if this be so, a wrong
448: Something unfilial: reason my son
449: Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason
450: The father, all whose joy is nothing else
451: But fair posterity, should hold some counsel
452: In such a business.
453: FLORIZEL: I yield all this;
454: But for some other reasons, my grave sir,
455: Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint
456: My father of this business.
457: POLIXENES: Let him know't.
458: FLORIZEL: He shall not.
459: POLIXENES: Prithee, let him.
460: FLORIZEL: No, he must not.
461: Shepherd: Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
462: At knowing of thy choice.
463: FLORIZEL: Come, come, he must not.
464: Mark our contract.
465: POLIXENES: Mark your divorce, young sir,
466: Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base
467: To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,
468: That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,
469: I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
470: But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece
471: Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know
472: The royal fool thou copest with,--
473: Shepherd: O, my heart!
474: POLIXENES: I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made
475: More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,
476: If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
477: That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never
478: I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;
479: Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,
480: Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:
481: Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,
482: Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee
483: From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--
484: Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,
485: That makes himself, but for our honour therein,
486: Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
487: These rural latches to his entrance open,
488: Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,
489: I will devise a death as cruel for thee
490: As thou art tender to't.
491: PERDITA: Even here undone!
492: I was not much afeard; for once or twice
493: I was about to speak and tell him plainly,
494: The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
495: Hides not his visage from our cottage but
496: Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?
497: I told you what would come of this: beseech you,
498: Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--
499: Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,
500: But milk my ewes and weep.
501: CAMILLO: Why, how now, father!
502: Speak ere thou diest.
503: Shepherd: I cannot speak, nor think
504: Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
505: You have undone a man of fourscore three,
506: That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,
507: To die upon the bed my father died,
508: To lie close by his honest bones: but now
509: Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
510: Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,
511: That knew'st this was the prince,
512: and wouldst adventure
513: To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
514: If I might die within this hour, I have lived
515: To die when I desire.
516: FLORIZEL: Why look you so upon me?
517: I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
518: But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;
519: More straining on for plucking back, not following
520: My leash unwillingly.
521: CAMILLO: Gracious my lord,
522: You know your father's temper: at this time
523: He will allow no speech, which I do guess
524: You do not purpose to him; and as hardly
525: Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:
526: Then, till the fury of his highness settle,
527: Come not before him.
528: FLORIZEL: I not purpose it.
529: I think, Camillo?
530: CAMILLO: Even he, my lord.
531: PERDITA: How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
532: How often said, my dignity would last
533: But till 'twere known!
534: FLORIZEL: It cannot fail but by
535: The violation of my faith; and then
536: Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together
537: And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:
538: From my succession wipe me, father; I
539: Am heir to my affection.
540: CAMILLO: Be advised.
541: FLORIZEL: I am, and by my fancy: if my reason
542: Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;
543: If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,
544: Do bid it welcome.
545: CAMILLO: This is desperate, sir.
546: FLORIZEL: So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;
547: I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,
548: Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may
549: Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or
550: The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
551: In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath
552: To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,
553: As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,
554: When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not
555: To see him any more,--cast your good counsels
556: Upon his passion; let myself and fortune
557: Tug for the time to come. This you may know
558: And so deliver, I am put to sea
559: With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;
560: And most opportune to our need I have
561: A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
562: For this design. What course I mean to hold
563: Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor
564: Concern me the reporting.
565: CAMILLO: O my lord!
566: I would your spirit were easier for advice,
567: Or stronger for your need.
568: FLORIZEL: Hark, Perdita
569: I'll hear you by and by.
570: CAMILLO: He's irremoveable,
571: Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
572: His going I could frame to serve my turn,
573: Save him from danger, do him love and honour,
574: Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
575: And that unhappy king, my master, whom
576: I so much thirst to see.
577: FLORIZEL: Now, good Camillo;
578: I am so fraught with curious business that
579: I leave out ceremony.
580: CAMILLO: Sir, I think
581: You have heard of my poor services, i' the love
582: That I have borne your father?
583: FLORIZEL: Very nobly
584: Have you deserved: it is my father's music
585: To speak your deeds, not little of his care
586: To have them recompensed as thought on.
587: CAMILLO: Well, my lord,
588: If you may please to think I love the king
589: And through him what is nearest to him, which is
590: Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:
591: If your more ponderous and settled project
592: May suffer alteration, on mine honour,
593: I'll point you where you shall have such receiving
594: As shall become your highness; where you may
595: Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
596: There's no disjunction to be made, but by--
597: As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,
598: And, with my best endeavours in your absence,
599: Your discontenting father strive to qualify
600: And bring him up to liking.
601: FLORIZEL: How, Camillo,
602: May this, almost a miracle, be done?
603: That I may call thee something more than man
604: And after that trust to thee.
605: CAMILLO: Have you thought on
606: A place whereto you'll go?
607: FLORIZEL: Not any yet:
608: But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
609: To what we wildly do, so we profess
610: Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
611: Of every wind that blows.
612: CAMILLO: Then list to me:
613: This follows, if you will not change your purpose
614: But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,
615: And there present yourself and your fair princess,
616: For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:
617: She shall be habited as it becomes
618: The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
619: Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
620: His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,
621: As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands
622: Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him
623: 'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one
624: He chides to hell and bids the other grow
625: Faster than thought or time.
626: FLORIZEL: Worthy Camillo,
627: What colour for my visitation shall I
628: Hold up before him?
629: CAMILLO: Sent by the king your father
630: To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,
631: The manner of your bearing towards him, with
632: What you as from your father shall deliver,
633: Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:
634: The which shall point you forth at every sitting
635: What you must say; that he shall not perceive
636: But that you have your father's bosom there
637: And speak his very heart.
638: FLORIZEL: I am bound to you:
639: There is some sap in this.
640: CAMILLO: A cause more promising
641: Than a wild dedication of yourselves
642: To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain
643: To miseries enough; no hope to help you,
644: But as you shake off one to take another;
645: Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
646: Do their best office, if they can but stay you
647: Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know
648: Prosperity's the very bond of love,
649: Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
650: Affliction alters.
651: PERDITA: One of these is true:
652: I think affliction may subdue the cheek,
653: But not take in the mind.
654: CAMILLO: Yea, say you so?
655: There shall not at your father's house these
656: seven years
657: Be born another such.
658: FLORIZEL: My good Camillo,
659: She is as forward of her breeding as
660: She is i' the rear our birth.
661: CAMILLO: I cannot say 'tis pity
662: She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress
663: To most that teach.
664: PERDITA: Your pardon, sir; for this
665: I'll blush you thanks.
666: FLORIZEL: My prettiest Perdita!
667: But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,
668: Preserver of my father, now of me,
669: The medicine of our house, how shall we do?
670: We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,
671: Nor shall appear in Sicilia.
672: CAMILLO: My lord,
673: Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes
674: Do all lie there: it shall be so my care
675: To have you royally appointed as if
676: The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,
677: That you may know you shall not want, one word.
678: AUTOLYCUS: Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his
679: sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold
680: all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a
681: ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,
682: knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,
683: to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who
684: should buy first, as if my trinkets had been
685: hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:
686: by which means I saw whose purse was best in
687: picture; and what I saw, to my good use I
688: remembered. My clown, who wants but something to
689: be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the
690: wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes
691: till he had both tune and words; which so drew the
692: rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
693: stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it
694: was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
695: purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in
696: chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,
697: and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this
698: time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
699: festival purses; and had not the old man come in
700: with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's
701: son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not
702: left a purse alive in the whole army.
703: CAMILLO: Nay, but my letters, by this means being there
704: So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.
705: FLORIZEL: And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--
706: CAMILLO: Shall satisfy your father.
707: PERDITA: Happy be you!
708: All that you speak shows fair.
709: CAMILLO: Who have we here?
710: We'll make an instrument of this, omit
711: Nothing may give us aid.
712: AUTOLYCUS: If they have overheard me now, why, hanging.
713: CAMILLO: How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear
714: not, man; here's no harm intended to thee.
715: AUTOLYCUS: I am a poor fellow, sir.
716: CAMILLO: Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from
717: thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must
718: make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,
719: --thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and
720: change garments with this gentleman: though the
721: pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,
722: there's some boot.
723: AUTOLYCUS: I am a poor fellow, sir.
724: I know ye well enough.
725: CAMILLO: Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half
726: flayed already.
727: AUTOLYCUS: Are you in earnest, sir?
728: I smell the trick on't.
729: FLORIZEL: Dispatch, I prithee.
730: AUTOLYCUS: Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with
731: conscience take it.
732: CAMILLO: Unbuckle, unbuckle.
733: Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy
734: Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself
735: Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat
736: And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,
737: Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken
738: The truth of your own seeming; that you may--
739: For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
740: Get undescried.
741: PERDITA: I see the play so lies
742: That I must bear a part.
743: CAMILLO: No remedy.
744: Have you done there?
745: FLORIZEL: Should I now meet my father,
746: He would not call me son.
747: CAMILLO: Nay, you shall have no hat.
748: Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.
749: AUTOLYCUS: Adieu, sir.
750: FLORIZEL: O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
751: Pray you, a word.
752: CAMILLO: [Aside] What I do next, shall be to tell the king
753: Of this escape and whither they are bound;
754: Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
755: To force him after: in whose company
756: I shall review Sicilia, for whose sight
757: I have a woman's longing.
758: FLORIZEL: Fortune speed us!
759: Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.
760: CAMILLO: The swifter speed the better.
761: AUTOLYCUS: I understand the business, I hear it: to have an
762: open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is
763: necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite
764: also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see
765: this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.
766: What an exchange had this been without boot! What
767: a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do
768: this year connive at us, and we may do any thing
769: extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of
770: iniquity, stealing away from his father with his
771: clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of
772: honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not
773: do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;
774: and therein am I constant to my profession.
775: Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:
776: every lane's end, every shop, church, session,
777: hanging, yields a careful man work.
778: Clown: See, see; what a man you are now!
779: There is no other way but to tell the king
780: she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.
781: Shepherd: Nay, but hear me.
782: Clown: Nay, but hear me.
783: Shepherd: Go to, then.
784: Clown: She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh
785: and blood has not offended the king; and so your
786: flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show
787: those things you found about her, those secret
788: things, all but what she has with her: this being
789: done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.
790: Shepherd: I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his
791: son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,
792: neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make
793: me the king's brother-in-law.
794: Clown: Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you
795: could have been to him and then your blood had been
796: the dearer by I know how much an ounce.
797: AUTOLYCUS: [Aside] Very wisely, puppies!
798: Shepherd: Well, let us to the king: there is that in this
799: fardel will make him scratch his beard.
800: AUTOLYCUS: [Aside] I know not what impediment this complaint
801: may be to the flight of my master.
802: Clown: Pray heartily he be at palace.
803: AUTOLYCUS: [Aside] Though I am not naturally honest, I am so
804: sometimes by chance: let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement.
805: How now, rustics! whither are you bound?
806: Shepherd: To the palace, an it like your worship.
807: AUTOLYCUS: Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition
808: of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your
809: names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any
810: thing that is fitting to be known, discover.
811: Clown: We are but plain fellows, sir.
812: AUTOLYCUS: A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no
813: lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they
814: often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for
815: it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore
816: they do not give us the lie.
817: Clown: Your worship had like to have given us one, if you
818: had not taken yourself with the manner.
819: Shepherd: Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?
820: AUTOLYCUS: Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest
821: thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
822: hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
823: receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I
824: not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,
825: for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy
826: business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier
827: cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck
828: back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to
829: open thy affair.
830: Shepherd: My business, sir, is to the king.
831: AUTOLYCUS: What advocate hast thou to him?
832: Shepherd: I know not, an't like you.
833: Clown: Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you
834: have none.
835: Shepherd: None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.
836: AUTOLYCUS: How blessed are we that are not simple men!
837: Yet nature might have made me as these are,
838: Therefore I will not disdain.
839: Clown: This cannot be but a great courtier.
840: Shepherd: His garments are rich, but he wears
841: them not handsomely.
842: Clown: He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:
843: a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking
844: on's teeth.
845: AUTOLYCUS: The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?
846: Wherefore that box?
847: Shepherd: Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,
848: which none must know but the king; and which he
849: shall know within this hour, if I may come to the
850: speech of him.
851: AUTOLYCUS: Age, thou hast lost thy labour.
852: Shepherd: Why, sir?
853: AUTOLYCUS: The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a
854: new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,
855: if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must
856: know the king is full of grief.
857: Shepard: So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have
858: married a shepherd's daughter.
859: AUTOLYCUS: If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:
860: the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall
861: feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.
862: Clown: Think you so, sir?
863: AUTOLYCUS: Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
864: and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to
865: him, though removed fifty times, shall all come
866: under the hangman: which though it be great pity,
867: yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a
868: ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into
869: grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death
870: is too soft for him, say I draw our throne into a
871: sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.
872: Clown: Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't
873: like you, sir?
874: AUTOLYCUS: He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then
875: 'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a
876: wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters
877: and a dram dead; then recovered again with
878: aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as
879: he is, and in the hottest day prognostication
880: proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the
881: sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he
882: is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what
883: talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries
884: are to be smiled at, their offences being so
885: capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain
886: men, what you have to the king: being something
887: gently considered, I'll bring you where he is
888: aboard, tender your persons to his presence,
889: whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man
890: besides the king to effect your suits, here is man
891: shall do it.
892: Clown: He seems to be of great authority: close with him,
893: give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn
894: bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show
895: the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,
896: and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'
897: Shepherd: An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for
898: us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much
899: more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.
900: AUTOLYCUS: After I have done what I promised?
901: Shepherd: Ay, sir.
902: AUTOLYCUS: Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?
903: Clown: In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful
904: one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.
905: AUTOLYCUS: O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,
906: he'll be made an example.
907: Clown: Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show
908: our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your
909: daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I
910: will give you as much as this old man does when the
911: business is performed, and remain, as he says, your
912: pawn till it be brought you.
913: AUTOLYCUS: I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;
914: go on the right hand: I will but look upon the
915: hedge and follow you.
916: Clown: We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.
917: Shepherd: Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.
ACT 5 SCENE 1

1: CLEOMENES: Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd
2: A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,
3: Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
4: More penitence than done trespass: at the last,
5: Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;
6: With them forgive yourself.
7: LEONTES: Whilst I remember
8: Her and her virtues, I cannot forget
9: My blemishes in them, and so still think of
10: The wrong I did myself; which was so much,
11: That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
12: Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
13: Bred his hopes out of.
14: PAULINA: True, too true, my lord:
15: If, one by one, you wedded all the world,
16: Or from the all that are took something good,
17: To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd
18: Would be unparallel'd.
19: LEONTES: I think so. Kill'd!
20: She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me
21: Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter
22: Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,
23: Say so but seldom.
24: CLEOMENES: Not at all, good lady:
25: You might have spoken a thousand things that would
26: Have done the time more benefit and graced
27: Your kindness better.
28: PAULINA: You are one of those
29: Would have him wed again.
30: DION: If you would not so,
31: You pity not the state, nor the remembrance
32: Of his most sovereign name; consider little
33: What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,
34: May drop upon his kingdom and devour
35: Incertain lookers on. What were more holy
36: Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
37: What holier than, for royalty's repair,
38: For present comfort and for future good,
39: To bless the bed of majesty again
40: With a sweet fellow to't?
41: PAULINA: There is none worthy,
42: Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
43: Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;
44: For has not the divine Apollo said,
45: Is't not the tenor of his oracle,
46: That King Leontes shall not have an heir
47: Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,
48: Is all as monstrous to our human reason
49: As my Antigonus to break his grave
50: And come again to me; who, on my life,
51: Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
52: My lord should to the heavens be contrary,
53: Oppose against their wills.
54: Care not for issue;
55: The crown will find an heir: great Alexander
56: Left his to the worthiest; so his successor
57: Was like to be the best.
58: LEONTES: Good Paulina,
59: Who hast the memory of Hermione,
60: I know, in honour, O, that ever I
61: Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,
62: I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
63: Have taken treasure from her lips--
64: PAULINA: And left them
65: More rich for what they yielded.
66: LEONTES: Thou speak'st truth.
67: No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
68: And better used, would make her sainted spirit
69: Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
70: Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
71: And begin, 'Why to me?'
72: PAULINA: Had she such power,
73: She had just cause.
74: LEONTES: She had; and would incense me
75: To murder her I married.
76: PAULINA: I should so.
77: Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark
78: Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't
79: You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears
80: Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd
81: Should be 'Remember mine.'
82: LEONTES: Stars, stars,
83: And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;
84: I'll have no wife, Paulina.
85: PAULINA: Will you swear
86: Never to marry but by my free leave?
87: LEONTES: Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!
88: PAULINA: Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.
89: CLEOMENES: You tempt him over-much.
90: PAULINA: Unless another,
91: As like Hermione as is her picture,
92: Affront his eye.
93: CLEOMENES: Good madam,--
94: PAULINA: I have done.
95: Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,
96: No remedy, but you will,--give me the office
97: To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
98: As was your former; but she shall be such
99: As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,
100: it should take joy
101: To see her in your arms.
102: LEONTES: My true Paulina,
103: We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.
104: PAULINA: That
105: Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;
106: Never till then.
107: Gentleman: One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,
108: Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she
109: The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access
110: To your high presence.
111: LEONTES: What with him? he comes not
112: Like to his father's greatness: his approach,
113: So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us
114: 'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced
115: By need and accident. What train?
116: Gentleman: But few,
117: And those but mean.
118: LEONTES: His princess, say you, with him?
119: Gentleman: Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,
120: That e'er the sun shone bright on.
121: PAULINA: O Hermione,
122: As every present time doth boast itself
123: Above a better gone, so must thy grave
124: Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself
125: Have said and writ so, but your writing now
126: Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,
127: Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
128: Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,
129: To say you have seen a better.
130: Gentleman: Pardon, madam:
131: The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--
132: The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,
133: Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,
134: Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
135: Of all professors else, make proselytes
136: Of who she but bid follow.
137: PAULINA: How! not women?
138: Gentleman: Women will love her, that she is a woman
139: More worth than any man; men, that she is
140: The rarest of all women.
141: LEONTES: Go, Cleomenes;
142: Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,
143: Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange
144: He thus should steal upon us.
145: PAULINA: Had our prince,
146: Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd
147: Well with this lord: there was not full a month
148: Between their births.
149: LEONTES: Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st
150: He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,
151: When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches
152: Will bring me to consider that which may
153: Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
154: Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;
155: For she did print your royal father off,
156: Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,
157: Your father's image is so hit in you,
158: His very air, that I should call you brother,
159: As I did him, and speak of something wildly
160: By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!
161: And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!
162: I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth
163: Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
164: You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--
165: All mine own folly--the society,
166: Amity too, of your brave father, whom,
167: Though bearing misery, I desire my life
168: Once more to look on him.
169: FLORIZEL: By his command
170: Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
171: Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
172: Can send his brother: and, but infirmity
173: Which waits upon worn times hath something seized
174: His wish'd ability, he had himself
175: The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
176: Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--
177: He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres
178: And those that bear them living.
179: LEONTES: O my brother,
180: Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir
181: Afresh within me, and these thy offices,
182: So rarely kind, are as interpreters
183: Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,
184: As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
185: Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,
186: At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,
187: To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
188: The adventure of her person?
189: FLORIZEL: Good my lord,
190: She came from Libya.
191: LEONTES: Where the warlike Smalus,
192: That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?
193: FLORIZEL: Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter
194: His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
195: A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
196: To execute the charge my father gave me
197: For visiting your highness: my best train
198: I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;
199: Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
200: Not only my success in Libya, sir,
201: But my arrival and my wife's in safety
202: Here where we are.
203: LEONTES: The blessed gods
204: Purge all infection from our air whilst you
205: Do climate here! You have a holy father,
206: A graceful gentleman; against whose person,
207: So sacred as it is, I have done sin:
208: For which the heavens, taking angry note,
209: Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,
210: As he from heaven merits it, with you
211: Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,
212: Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,
213: Such goodly things as you!
214: Lord: Most noble sir,
215: That which I shall report will bear no credit,
216: Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,
217: Bohemia greets you from himself by me;
218: Desires you to attach his son, who has--
219: His dignity and duty both cast off--
220: Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with
221: A shepherd's daughter.
222: LEONTES: Where's Bohemia? speak.
223: Lord: Here in your city; I now came from him:
224: I speak amazedly; and it becomes
225: My marvel and my message. To your court
226: Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,
227: Of this fair couple, meets he on the way
228: The father of this seeming lady and
229: Her brother, having both their country quitted
230: With this young prince.
231: FLORIZEL: Camillo has betray'd me;
232: Whose honour and whose honesty till now
233: Endured all weathers.
234: Lord: Lay't so to his charge:
235: He's with the king your father.
236: LEONTES: Who? Camillo?
237: Lord: Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now
238: Has these poor men in question. Never saw I
239: Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;
240: Forswear themselves as often as they speak:
241: Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them
242: With divers deaths in death.
243: PERDITA: O my poor father!
244: The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have
245: Our contract celebrated.
246: LEONTES: You are married?
247: FLORIZEL: We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;
248: The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:
249: The odds for high and low's alike.
250: LEONTES: My lord,
251: Is this the daughter of a king?
252: FLORIZEL: She is,
253: When once she is my wife.
254: LEONTES: That 'once' I see by your good father's speed
255: Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,
256: Most sorry, you have broken from his liking
257: Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry
258: Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,
259: That you might well enjoy her.
260: FLORIZEL: Dear, look up:
261: Though Fortune, visible an enemy,
262: Should chase us with my father, power no jot
263: Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,
264: Remember since you owed no more to time
265: Than I do now: with thought of such affections,
266: Step forth mine advocate; at your request
267: My father will grant precious things as trifles.
268: LEONTES: Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,
269: Which he counts but a trifle.
270: PAULINA: Sir, my liege,
271: Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month
272: 'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes
273: Than what you look on now.
274: LEONTES: I thought of her,
275: Even in these looks I made.
276: But your petition
277: Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:
278: Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,
279: I am friend to them and you: upon which errand
280: I now go toward him; therefore follow me
281: And mark what way I make: come, good my lord.
ACT 5 SCENE 2

1: AUTOLYCUS: Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?
2: First Gentleman: I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old
3: shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:
4: whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all
5: commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I
6: heard the shepherd say, he found the child.
7: AUTOLYCUS: I would most gladly know the issue of it.
8: First Gentleman: I make a broken delivery of the business; but the
9: changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were
10: very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with
11: staring on one another, to tear the cases of their
12: eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language
13: in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard
14: of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable
15: passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest
16: beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not
17: say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the
18: extremity of the one, it must needs be.
19: Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.
20: The news, Rogero?
21: Second Gentleman: Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the
22: king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
23: broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
24: cannot be able to express it.
25: Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can
26: deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news
27: which is called true is so like an old tale, that
28: the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king
29: found his heir?
30: Third Gentleman: Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
31: circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you
32: see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle
33: of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,
34: the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
35: know to be his character, the majesty of the
36: creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection
37: of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,
38: and many other evidences proclaim her with all
39: certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see
40: the meeting of the two kings?
41: Second Gentleman: No.
42: Third Gentleman: Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,
43: cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one
44: joy crown another, so and in such manner that it
45: seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their
46: joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,
47: holding up of hands, with countenances of such
48: distraction that they were to be known by garment,
49: not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of
50: himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that
51: joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,
52: thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then
53: embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his
54: daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old
55: shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten
56: conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such
57: another encounter, which lames report to follow it
58: and undoes description to do it.
59: Second Gentleman: What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried
60: hence the child?
61: Third Gentleman: Like an old tale still, which will have matter to
62: rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear
63: open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
64: avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his
65: innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a
66: handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.
67: First Gentleman: What became of his bark and his followers?
68: Third Gentleman: Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and
69: in the view of the shepherd: so that all the
70: instruments which aided to expose the child were
71: even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble
72: combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
73: Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of
74: her husband, another elevated that the oracle was
75: fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,
76: and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin
77: her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
78: of losing.
79: First Gentleman: The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
80: kings and princes; for by such was it acted.
81: Third Gentleman: One of the prettiest touches of all and that which
82: angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not
83: the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's
84: death, with the manner how she came to't bravely
85: confessed and lamented by the king, how
86: attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one
87: sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'
88: I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my
89: heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed
90: colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world
91: could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.
92: First Gentleman: Are they returned to the court?
93: Third Gentleman: No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,
94: which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many
95: years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
96: Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself
97: eternity and could put breath into his work, would
98: beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her
99: ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that
100: they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
101: answer: thither with all greediness of affection
102: are they gone, and there they intend to sup.
103: Second Gentleman: I thought she had some great matter there in hand;
104: for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever
105: since the death of Hermione, visited that removed
106: house. Shall we thither and with our company piece
107: the rejoicing?
108: First Gentleman: Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?
109: every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:
110: our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
111: Let's along.
112: AUTOLYCUS: Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,
113: would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old
114: man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard
115: them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he
116: at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,
117: so he then took her to be, who began to be much
118: sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of
119: weather continuing, this mystery remained
120: undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I
121: been the finder out of this secret, it would not
122: have relished among my other discredits.
123: Here come those I have done good to against my will,
124: and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.
125: Shepherd: Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and
126: daughters will be all gentlemen born.
127: Clown: You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me
128: this other day, because I was no gentleman born.
129: See you these clothes? say you see them not and
130: think me still no gentleman born: you were best say
131: these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the
132: lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.
133: AUTOLYCUS: I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.
134: Clown: Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.
135: Shepherd: And so have I, boy.
136: Clown: So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my
137: father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and
138: called me brother; and then the two kings called my
139: father brother; and then the prince my brother and
140: the princess my sister called my father father; and
141: so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like
142: tears that ever we shed.
143: Shepherd: We may live, son, to shed many more.
144: Clown: Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so
145: preposterous estate as we are.
146: AUTOLYCUS: I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the
147: faults I have committed to your worship and to give
148: me your good report to the prince my master.
149: Shepherd: Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are
150: gentlemen.
151: Clown: Thou wilt amend thy life?
152: AUTOLYCUS: Ay, an it like your good worship.
153: Clown: Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou
154: art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.
155: Shepherd: You may say it, but not swear it.
156: Clown: Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and
157: franklins say it, I'll swear it.
158: Shepherd: How if it be false, son?
159: Clown: If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear
160: it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to
161: the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
162: that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no
163: tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
164: drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst
165: be a tall fellow of thy hands.
166: AUTOLYCUS: I will prove so, sir, to my power.
167: Clown: Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not
168: wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not
169: being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings
170: and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the
171: queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy
172: good masters.
ACT 5 SCENE 3

1: LEONTES: O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort
2: That I have had of thee!
3: PAULINA: What, sovereign sir,
4: I did not well I meant well. All my services
5: You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,
6: With your crown'd brother and these your contracted
7: Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
8: It is a surplus of your grace, which never
9: My life may last to answer.
10: LEONTES: O Paulina,
11: We honour you with trouble: but we came
12: To see the statue of our queen: your gallery
13: Have we pass'd through, not without much content
14: In many singularities; but we saw not
15: That which my daughter came to look upon,
16: The statue of her mother.
17: PAULINA: As she lived peerless,
18: So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
19: Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
20: Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it
21: Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare
22: To see the life as lively mock'd as ever
23: Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.
24: I like your silence, it the more shows off
25: Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,
26: Comes it not something near?
27: LEONTES: Her natural posture!
28: Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
29: Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she
30: In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
31: As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,
32: Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing
33: So aged as this seems.
34: POLIXENES: O, not by much.
35: PAULINA: So much the more our carver's excellence;
36: Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
37: As she lived now.
38: LEONTES: As now she might have done,
39: So much to my good comfort, as it is
40: Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
41: Even with such life of majesty, warm life,
42: As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!
43: I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me
44: For being more stone than it? O royal piece,
45: There's magic in thy majesty, which has
46: My evils conjured to remembrance and
47: From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
48: Standing like stone with thee.
49: PERDITA: And give me leave,
50: And do not say 'tis superstition, that
51: I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,
52: Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
53: Give me that hand of yours to kiss.
54: PAULINA: O, patience!
55: The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.
56: CAMILLO: My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
57: Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
58: So many summers dry; scarce any joy
59: Did ever so long live; no sorrow
60: But kill'd itself much sooner.
61: POLIXENES: Dear my brother,
62: Let him that was the cause of this have power
63: To take off so much grief from you as he
64: Will piece up in himself.
65: PAULINA: Indeed, my lord,
66: If I had thought the sight of my poor image
67: Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--
68: I'ld not have show'd it.
69: LEONTES: Do not draw the curtain.
70: PAULINA: No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy
71: May think anon it moves.
72: LEONTES: Let be, let be.
73: Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--
74: What was he that did make it? See, my lord,
75: Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
76: Did verily bear blood?
77: POLIXENES: Masterly done:
78: The very life seems warm upon her lip.
79: LEONTES: The fixture of her eye has motion in't,
80: As we are mock'd with art.
81: PAULINA: I'll draw the curtain:
82: My lord's almost so far transported that
83: He'll think anon it lives.
84: LEONTES: O sweet Paulina,
85: Make me to think so twenty years together!
86: No settled senses of the world can match
87: The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.
88: PAULINA: I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but
89: I could afflict you farther.
90: LEONTES: Do, Paulina;
91: For this affliction has a taste as sweet
92: As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,
93: There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
94: Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,
95: For I will kiss her.
96: PAULINA: Good my lord, forbear:
97: The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
98: You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
99: With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?
100: LEONTES: No, not these twenty years.
101: PERDITA: So long could I
102: Stand by, a looker on.
103: PAULINA: Either forbear,
104: Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
105: For more amazement. If you can behold it,
106: I'll make the statue move indeed, descend
107: And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--
108: Which I protest against--I am assisted
109: By wicked powers.
110: LEONTES: What you can make her do,
111: I am content to look on: what to speak,
112: I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy
113: To make her speak as move.
114: PAULINA: It is required
115: You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;
116: On: those that think it is unlawful business
117: I am about, let them depart.
118: LEONTES: Proceed:
119: No foot shall stir.
120: PAULINA: Music, awake her; strike!
121: 'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
122: Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
123: I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,
124: Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
125: Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
126: Start not; her actions shall be holy as
127: You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
128: Until you see her die again; for then
129: You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:
130: When she was young you woo'd her; now in age
131: Is she become the suitor?
132: LEONTES: O, she's warm!
133: If this be magic, let it be an art
134: Lawful as eating.
135: POLIXENES: She embraces him.
136: CAMILLO: She hangs about his neck:
137: If she pertain to life let her speak too.
138: POLIXENES: Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,
139: Or how stolen from the dead.
140: PAULINA: That she is living,
141: Were it but told you, should be hooted at
142: Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,
143: Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
144: Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel
145: And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;
146: Our Perdita is found.
147: HERMIONE: You gods, look down
148: And from your sacred vials pour your graces
149: Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
150: Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found
151: Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,
152: Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
153: Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved
154: Myself to see the issue.
155: PAULINA: There's time enough for that;
156: Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
157: Your joys with like relation. Go together,
158: You precious winners all; your exultation
159: Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,
160: Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
161: My mate, that's never to be found again,
162: Lament till I am lost.
