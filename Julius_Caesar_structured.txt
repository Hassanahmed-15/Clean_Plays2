ACT 1 SCENE 1

1: FLAVIUS: Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:
2: Is this a holiday? what! know you not,
3: Being mechanical, you ought not walk
4: Upon a labouring day without the sign
5: Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?
6: First Commoner: Why, sir, a carpenter.
7: MARULLUS: Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
8: What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
9: You, sir, what trade are you?
10: Second Commoner: Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,
11: as you would say, a cobbler.
12: MARULLUS: But what trade art thou? answer me directly.
13: Second Commoner: A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe
14: conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.
15: MARULLUS: What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?
16: Second Commoner: Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,
17: if you be out, sir, I can mend you.
18: MARULLUS: What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!
19: Second Commoner: Why, sir, cobble you.
20: FLAVIUS: Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
21: Second Commoner: Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I
22: meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's
23: matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon
24: to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I
25: recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
26: neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.
27: FLAVIUS: But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
28: Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
29: Second Commoner: Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself
30: into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,
31: to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.
32: MARULLUS: Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
33: What tributaries follow him to Rome,
34: To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
35: You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
36: O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
37: Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
38: Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,
39: To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
40: Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
41: The livelong day, with patient expectation,
42: To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:
43: And when you saw his chariot but appear,
44: Have you not made an universal shout,
45: That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
46: To hear the replication of your sounds
47: Made in her concave shores?
48: And do you now put on your best attire?
49: And do you now cull out a holiday?
50: And do you now strew flowers in his way
51: That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!
52: Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
53: Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
54: That needs must light on this ingratitude.
55: FLAVIUS: Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
56: Assemble all the poor men of your sort;
57: Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
58: Into the channel, till the lowest stream
59: Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
60: See whether their basest metal be not moved;
61: They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
62: Go you down that way towards the Capitol;
63: This way will I: disrobe the images,
64: If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.
65: MARULLUS: May we do so?
66: You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
67: FLAVIUS: It is no matter; let no images
68: Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,
69: And drive away the vulgar from the streets:
70: So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
71: These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
72: Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
73: Who else would soar above the view of men
74: And keep us all in servile fearfulness.
ACT 1 SCENE 2

1: CAESAR: Calpurnia!
2: CASCA: Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.
3: CAESAR: Calpurnia!
4: CALPURNIA: Here, my lord.
5: CAESAR: Stand you directly in Antonius' way,
6: When he doth run his course. Antonius!
7: ANTONY: Caesar, my lord?
8: CAESAR: Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,
9: To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,
10: The barren, touched in this holy chase,
11: Shake off their sterile curse.
12: ANTONY: I shall remember:
13: When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.
14: CAESAR: Set on; and leave no ceremony out.
15: Soothsayer: Caesar!
16: CAESAR: Ha! who calls?
17: CASCA: Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!
18: CAESAR: Who is it in the press that calls on me?
19: I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
20: Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.
21: Soothsayer: Beware the ides of March.
22: CAESAR: What man is that?
23: BRUTUS: A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.
24: CAESAR: Set him before me; let me see his face.
25: CASSIUS: Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.
26: CAESAR: What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.
27: Soothsayer: Beware the ides of March.
28: CAESAR: He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.
29: CASSIUS: Will you go see the order of the course?
30: BRUTUS: Not I.
31: CASSIUS: I pray you, do.
32: BRUTUS: I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
33: Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
34: Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
35: I'll leave you.
36: CASSIUS: Brutus, I do observe you now of late:
37: I have not from your eyes that gentleness
38: And show of love as I was wont to have:
39: You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
40: Over your friend that loves you.
41: BRUTUS: Cassius,
42: Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,
43: I turn the trouble of my countenance
44: Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
45: Of late with passions of some difference,
46: Conceptions only proper to myself,
47: Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
48: But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
49: Among which number, Cassius, be you one--
50: Nor construe any further my neglect,
51: Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
52: Forgets the shows of love to other men.
53: CASSIUS: Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
54: By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
55: Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
56: Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
57: BRUTUS: No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
58: But by reflection, by some other things.
59: CASSIUS: 'Tis just:
60: And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
61: That you have no such mirrors as will turn
62: Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
63: That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
64: Where many of the best respect in Rome,
65: Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
66: And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
67: Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.
68: BRUTUS: Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
69: That you would have me seek into myself
70: For that which is not in me?
71: CASSIUS: Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:
72: And since you know you cannot see yourself
73: So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
74: Will modestly discover to yourself
75: That of yourself which you yet know not of.
76: And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:
77: Were I a common laugher, or did use
78: To stale with ordinary oaths my love
79: To every new protester; if you know
80: That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
81: And after scandal them, or if you know
82: That I profess myself in banqueting
83: To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
84: BRUTUS: What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
85: Choose Caesar for their king.
86: CASSIUS: Ay, do you fear it?
87: Then must I think you would not have it so.
88: BRUTUS: I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
89: But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
90: What is it that you would impart to me?
91: If it be aught toward the general good,
92: Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,
93: And I will look on both indifferently,
94: For let the gods so speed me as I love
95: The name of honour more than I fear death.
96: CASSIUS: I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
97: As well as I do know your outward favour.
98: Well, honour is the subject of my story.
99: I cannot tell what you and other men
100: Think of this life; but, for my single self,
101: I had as lief not be as live to be
102: In awe of such a thing as I myself.
103: I was born free as Caesar; so were you:
104: We both have fed as well, and we can both
105: Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
106: For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
107: The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
108: Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now
109: Leap in with me into this angry flood,
110: And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
111: Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
112: And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
113: The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
114: With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
115: And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
116: But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
117: Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'
118: I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
119: Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
120: The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
121: Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
122: Is now become a god, and Cassius is
123: A wretched creature and must bend his body,
124: If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
125: He had a fever when he was in Spain,
126: And when the fit was on him, I did mark
127: How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
128: His coward lips did from their colour fly,
129: And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
130: Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
131: Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
132: Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
133: Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'
134: As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me
135: A man of such a feeble temper should
136: So get the start of the majestic world
137: And bear the palm alone.
138: BRUTUS: Another general shout!
139: I do believe that these applauses are
140: For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.
141: CASSIUS: Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
142: Like a Colossus, and we petty men
143: Walk under his huge legs and peep about
144: To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
145: Men at some time are masters of their fates:
146: The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
147: But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
148: Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?
149: Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
150: Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
151: Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
152: Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
153: Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.
154: Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
155: Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,
156: That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
157: Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
158: When went there by an age, since the great flood,
159: But it was famed with more than with one man?
160: When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,
161: That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
162: Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,
163: When there is in it but one only man.
164: O, you and I have heard our fathers say,
165: There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
166: The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
167: As easily as a king.
168: BRUTUS: That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
169: What you would work me to, I have some aim:
170: How I have thought of this and of these times,
171: I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
172: I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
173: Be any further moved. What you have said
174: I will consider; what you have to say
175: I will with patience hear, and find a time
176: Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
177: Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
178: Brutus had rather be a villager
179: Than to repute himself a son of Rome
180: Under these hard conditions as this time
181: Is like to lay upon us.
182: CASSIUS: I am glad that my weak words
183: Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
184: BRUTUS: The games are done and Caesar is returning.
185: CASSIUS: As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;
186: And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
187: What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.
188: BRUTUS: I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
189: The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
190: And all the rest look like a chidden train:
191: Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero
192: Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
193: As we have seen him in the Capitol,
194: Being cross'd in conference by some senators.
195: CASSIUS: Casca will tell us what the matter is.
196: CAESAR: Antonius!
197: ANTONY: Caesar?
198: CAESAR: Let me have men about me that are fat;
199: Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
200: Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
201: He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.
202: ANTONY: Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
203: He is a noble Roman and well given.
204: CAESAR: Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
205: Yet if my name were liable to fear,
206: I do not know the man I should avoid
207: So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
208: He is a great observer and he looks
209: Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
210: As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
211: Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
212: As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
213: That could be moved to smile at any thing.
214: Such men as he be never at heart's ease
215: Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
216: And therefore are they very dangerous.
217: I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
218: Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
219: Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
220: And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
221: CASCA: You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
222: BRUTUS: Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,
223: That Caesar looks so sad.
224: CASCA: Why, you were with him, were you not?
225: BRUTUS: I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
226: CASCA: Why, there was a crown offered him: and being
227: offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,
228: thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.
229: BRUTUS: What was the second noise for?
230: CASCA: Why, for that too.
231: CASSIUS: They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
232: CASCA: Why, for that too.
233: BRUTUS: Was the crown offered him thrice?
234: CASCA: Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every
235: time gentler than other, and at every putting-by
236: mine honest neighbours shouted.
237: CASSIUS: Who offered him the crown?
238: CASCA: Why, Antony.
239: BRUTUS: Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
240: CASCA: I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:
241: it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
242: Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown
243: neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told
244: you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my
245: thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he
246: offered it to him again; then he put it by again:
247: but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his
248: fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
249: time; he put it the third time by: and still as he
250: refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their
251: chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
252: and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
253: Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
254: Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and
255: for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of
256: opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
257: CASSIUS: But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?
258: CASCA: He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at
259: mouth, and was speechless.
260: BRUTUS: 'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.
261: CASSIUS: No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,
262: And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
263: CASCA: I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,
264: Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
265: clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and
266: displeased them, as they use to do the players in
267: the theatre, I am no true man.
268: BRUTUS: What said he when he came unto himself?
269: CASCA: Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the
270: common herd was glad he refused the crown, he
271: plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
272: throat to cut. An I had been a man of any
273: occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,
274: I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
275: he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,
276: If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired
277: their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three
278: or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good
279: soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
280: there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had
281: stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.
282: BRUTUS: And after that, he came, thus sad, away?
283: CASCA: Ay.
284: CASSIUS: Did Cicero say any thing?
285: CASCA: Ay, he spoke Greek.
286: CASSIUS: To what effect?
287: CASCA: Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the
288: face again: but those that understood him smiled at
289: one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own
290: part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more
291: news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs
292: off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you
293: well. There was more foolery yet, if I could
294: remember it.
295: CASSIUS: Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?
296: CASCA: No, I am promised forth.
297: CASSIUS: Will you dine with me to-morrow?
298: CASCA: Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
299: worth the eating.
300: CASSIUS: Good: I will expect you.
301: CASCA: Do so. Farewell, both.
302: BRUTUS: What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
303: He was quick mettle when he went to school.
304: CASSIUS: So is he now in execution
305: Of any bold or noble enterprise,
306: However he puts on this tardy form.
307: This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
308: Which gives men stomach to digest his words
309: With better appetite.
310: BRUTUS: And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
311: To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,
312: I will come home to you; or, if you will,
313: Come home to me, and I will wait for you.
314: CASSIUS: I will do so: till then, think of the world.
315: Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,
316: Thy honourable metal may be wrought
317: From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet
318: That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
319: For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
320: Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:
321: If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
322: He should not humour me. I will this night,
323: In several hands, in at his windows throw,
324: As if they came from several citizens,
325: Writings all tending to the great opinion
326: That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely
327: Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:
328: And after this let Caesar seat him sure;
329: For we will shake him, or worse days endure.
ACT 1 SCENE 3

1: CICERO: Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?
2: Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?
3: CASCA: Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
4: Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
5: I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
6: Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
7: The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,
8: To be exalted with the threatening clouds:
9: But never till to-night, never till now,
10: Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
11: Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
12: Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
13: Incenses them to send destruction.
14: CICERO: Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?
15: CASCA: A common slave--you know him well by sight--
16: Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
17: Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,
18: Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.
19: Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--
20: Against the Capitol I met a lion,
21: Who glared upon me, and went surly by,
22: Without annoying me: and there were drawn
23: Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
24: Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw
25: Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
26: And yesterday the bird of night did sit
27: Even at noon-day upon the market-place,
28: Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
29: Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
30: 'These are their reasons; they are natural;'
31: For, I believe, they are portentous things
32: Unto the climate that they point upon.
33: CICERO: Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:
34: But men may construe things after their fashion,
35: Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
36: Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?
37: CASCA: He doth; for he did bid Antonius
38: Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.
39: CICERO: Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky
40: Is not to walk in.
41: CASCA: Farewell, Cicero.
42: CASSIUS: Who's there?
43: CASCA: A Roman.
44: CASSIUS: Casca, by your voice.
45: CASCA: Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
46: CASSIUS: A very pleasing night to honest men.
47: CASCA: Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
48: CASSIUS: Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
49: For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,
50: Submitting me unto the perilous night,
51: And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
52: Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;
53: And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
54: The breast of heaven, I did present myself
55: Even in the aim and very flash of it.
56: CASCA: But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
57: It is the part of men to fear and tremble,
58: When the most mighty gods by tokens send
59: Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
60: CASSIUS: You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
61: That should be in a Roman you do want,
62: Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
63: And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,
64: To see the strange impatience of the heavens:
65: But if you would consider the true cause
66: Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
67: Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
68: Why old men fool and children calculate,
69: Why all these things change from their ordinance
70: Their natures and preformed faculties
71: To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find
72: That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,
73: To make them instruments of fear and warning
74: Unto some monstrous state.
75: Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
76: Most like this dreadful night,
77: That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
78: As doth the lion in the Capitol,
79: A man no mightier than thyself or me
80: In personal action, yet prodigious grown
81: And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
82: CASCA: 'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?
83: CASSIUS: Let it be who it is: for Romans now
84: Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;
85: But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,
86: And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
87: Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
88: CASCA: Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow
89: Mean to establish Caesar as a king;
90: And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,
91: In every place, save here in Italy.
92: CASSIUS: I know where I will wear this dagger then;
93: Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
94: Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
95: Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:
96: Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
97: Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
98: Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
99: But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
100: Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
101: If I know this, know all the world besides,
102: That part of tyranny that I do bear
103: I can shake off at pleasure.
104: CASCA: So can I:
105: So every bondman in his own hand bears
106: The power to cancel his captivity.
107: CASSIUS: And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
108: Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,
109: But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:
110: He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
111: Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
112: Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,
113: What rubbish and what offal, when it serves
114: For the base matter to illuminate
115: So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
116: Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
117: Before a willing bondman; then I know
118: My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,
119: And dangers are to me indifferent.
120: CASCA: You speak to Casca, and to such a man
121: That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:
122: Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
123: And I will set this foot of mine as far
124: As who goes farthest.
125: CASSIUS: There's a bargain made.
126: Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
127: Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
128: To undergo with me an enterprise
129: Of honourable-dangerous consequence;
130: And I do know, by this, they stay for me
131: In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,
132: There is no stir or walking in the streets;
133: And the complexion of the element
134: In favour's like the work we have in hand,
135: Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
136: CASCA: Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
137: CASSIUS: 'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;
138: He is a friend.
139: Cinna, where haste you so?
140: CINNA: To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
141: CASSIUS: No, it is Casca; one incorporate
142: To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?
143: CINNA: I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!
144: There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
145: CASSIUS: Am I not stay'd for? tell me.
146: CINNA: Yes, you are.
147: O Cassius, if you could
148: But win the noble Brutus to our party--
149: CASSIUS: Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,
150: And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,
151: Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
152: In at his window; set this up with wax
153: Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
154: Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.
155: Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
156: CINNA: All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone
157: To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,
158: And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
159: CASSIUS: That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.
160: Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
161: See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
162: Is ours already, and the man entire
163: Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
164: CASCA: O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:
165: And that which would appear offence in us,
166: His countenance, like richest alchemy,
167: Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
ACT 2 SCENE 1

1: BRUTUS: What, Lucius, ho!
2: I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
3: Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
4: I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
5: When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!
6: LUCIUS: Call'd you, my lord?
7: BRUTUS: Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:
8: When it is lighted, come and call me here.
9: LUCIUS: I will, my lord.
10: BRUTUS: It must be by his death: and for my part,
11: I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
12: But for the general. He would be crown'd:
13: How that might change his nature, there's the question.
14: It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
15: And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--
16: And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
17: That at his will he may do danger with.
18: The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
19: Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,
20: I have not known when his affections sway'd
21: More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
22: That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
23: Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
24: But when he once attains the upmost round.
25: He then unto the ladder turns his back,
26: Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
27: By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.
28: Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
29: Will bear no colour for the thing he is,
30: Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,
31: Would run to these and these extremities:
32: And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
33: Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,
34: And kill him in the shell.
35: LUCIUS: The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
36: Searching the window for a flint, I found
37: This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,
38: It did not lie there when I went to bed.
39: BRUTUS: Get you to bed again; it is not day.
40: Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?
41: LUCIUS: I know not, sir.
42: BRUTUS: Look in the calendar, and bring me word.
43: LUCIUS: I will, sir.
44: BRUTUS: The exhalations whizzing in the air
45: Give so much light that I may read by them.
46: 'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.
47: Shall Rome, & c. Speak, strike, redress!
48: Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'
49: Such instigations have been often dropp'd
50: Where I have took them up.
51: 'Shall Rome, & c.' Thus must I piece it out:
52: Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
53: My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
54: The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
55: 'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated
56: To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:
57: If the redress will follow, thou receivest
58: Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
59: LUCIUS: Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.
60: BRUTUS: 'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.
61: Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,
62: I have not slept.
63: Between the acting of a dreadful thing
64: And the first motion, all the interim is
65: Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:
66: The Genius and the mortal instruments
67: Are then in council; and the state of man,
68: Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
69: The nature of an insurrection.
70: LUCIUS: Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
71: Who doth desire to see you.
72: BRUTUS: Is he alone?
73: LUCIUS: No, sir, there are moe with him.
74: BRUTUS: Do you know them?
75: LUCIUS: No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
76: And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
77: That by no means I may discover them
78: By any mark of favour.
79: BRUTUS: Let 'em enter.
80: They are the faction. O conspiracy,
81: Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
82: When evils are most free? O, then by day
83: Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
84: To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;
85: Hide it in smiles and affability:
86: For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
87: Not Erebus itself were dim enough
88: To hide thee from prevention.
89: CASSIUS: I think we are too bold upon your rest:
90: Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?
91: BRUTUS: I have been up this hour, awake all night.
92: Know I these men that come along with you?
93: CASSIUS: Yes, every man of them, and no man here
94: But honours you; and every one doth wish
95: You had but that opinion of yourself
96: Which every noble Roman bears of you.
97: This is Trebonius.
98: BRUTUS: He is welcome hither.
99: CASSIUS: This, Decius Brutus.
100: BRUTUS: He is welcome too.
101: CASSIUS: This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.
102: BRUTUS: They are all welcome.
103: What watchful cares do interpose themselves
104: Betwixt your eyes and night?
105: CASSIUS: Shall I entreat a word?
106: DECIUS BRUTUS: Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?
107: CASCA: No.
108: CINNA: O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
109: That fret the clouds are messengers of day.
110: CASCA: You shall confess that you are both deceived.
111: Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,
112: Which is a great way growing on the south,
113: Weighing the youthful season of the year.
114: Some two months hence up higher toward the north
115: He first presents his fire; and the high east
116: Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.
117: BRUTUS: Give me your hands all over, one by one.
118: CASSIUS: And let us swear our resolution.
119: BRUTUS: No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
120: The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--
121: If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
122: And every man hence to his idle bed;
123: So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
124: Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
125: As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
126: To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
127: The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
128: What need we any spur but our own cause,
129: To prick us to redress? what other bond
130: Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,
131: And will not palter? and what other oath
132: Than honesty to honesty engaged,
133: That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
134: Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
135: Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
136: That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
137: Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
138: The even virtue of our enterprise,
139: Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
140: To think that or our cause or our performance
141: Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
142: That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
143: Is guilty of a several bastardy,
144: If he do break the smallest particle
145: Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
146: CASSIUS: But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?
147: I think he will stand very strong with us.
148: CASCA: Let us not leave him out.
149: CINNA: No, by no means.
150: METELLUS CIMBER: O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
151: Will purchase us a good opinion
152: And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:
153: It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;
154: Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
155: But all be buried in his gravity.
156: BRUTUS: O, name him not: let us not break with him;
157: For he will never follow any thing
158: That other men begin.
159: CASSIUS: Then leave him out.
160: CASCA: Indeed he is not fit.
161: DECIUS BRUTUS: Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
162: CASSIUS: Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
163: Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
164: Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him
165: A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,
166: If he improve them, may well stretch so far
167: As to annoy us all: which to prevent,
168: Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
169: BRUTUS: Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
170: To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,
171: Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
172: For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:
173: Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
174: We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;
175: And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
176: O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,
177: And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
178: Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
179: Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
180: Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
181: Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
182: And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
183: Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
184: And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
185: Our purpose necessary and not envious:
186: Which so appearing to the common eyes,
187: We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
188: And for Mark Antony, think not of him;
189: For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
190: When Caesar's head is off.
191: CASSIUS: Yet I fear him;
192: For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--
193: BRUTUS: Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:
194: If he love Caesar, all that he can do
195: Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:
196: And that were much he should; for he is given
197: To sports, to wildness and much company.
198: TREBONIUS: There is no fear in him; let him not die;
199: For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.
200: BRUTUS: Peace! count the clock.
201: CASSIUS: The clock hath stricken three.
202: TREBONIUS: 'Tis time to part.
203: CASSIUS: But it is doubtful yet,
204: Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;
205: For he is superstitious grown of late,
206: Quite from the main opinion he held once
207: Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:
208: It may be, these apparent prodigies,
209: The unaccustom'd terror of this night,
210: And the persuasion of his augurers,
211: May hold him from the Capitol to-day.
212: DECIUS BRUTUS: Never fear that: if he be so resolved,
213: I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear
214: That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,
215: And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
216: Lions with toils and men with flatterers;
217: But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
218: He says he does, being then most flattered.
219: Let me work;
220: For I can give his humour the true bent,
221: And I will bring him to the Capitol.
222: CASSIUS: Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
223: BRUTUS: By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?
224: CINNA: Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
225: METELLUS CIMBER: Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
226: Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:
227: I wonder none of you have thought of him.
228: BRUTUS: Now, good Metellus, go along by him:
229: He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
230: Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.
231: CASSIUS: The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.
232: And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember
233: What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.
234: BRUTUS: Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
235: Let not our looks put on our purposes,
236: But bear it as our Roman actors do,
237: With untired spirits and formal constancy:
238: And so good morrow to you every one.
239: Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;
240: Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
241: Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
242: Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
243: Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
244: PORTIA: Brutus, my lord!
245: BRUTUS: Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?
246: It is not for your health thus to commit
247: Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
248: PORTIA: Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,
249: Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,
250: You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,
251: Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
252: And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
253: You stared upon me with ungentle looks;
254: I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,
255: And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;
256: Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
257: But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
258: Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
259: Fearing to strengthen that impatience
260: Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal
261: Hoping it was but an effect of humour,
262: Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
263: It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
264: And could it work so much upon your shape
265: As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
266: I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,
267: Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
268: BRUTUS: I am not well in health, and that is all.
269: PORTIA: Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
270: He would embrace the means to come by it.
271: BRUTUS: Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
272: PORTIA: Is Brutus sick? and is it physical
273: To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
274: Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
275: And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,
276: To dare the vile contagion of the night
277: And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
278: To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;
279: You have some sick offence within your mind,
280: Which, by the right and virtue of my place,
281: I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
282: I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,
283: By all your vows of love and that great vow
284: Which did incorporate and make us one,
285: That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
286: Why you are heavy, and what men to-night
287: Have had to resort to you: for here have been
288: Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
289: Even from darkness.
290: BRUTUS: Kneel not, gentle Portia.
291: PORTIA: I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
292: Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
293: Is it excepted I should know no secrets
294: That appertain to you? Am I yourself
295: But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
296: To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
297: And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
298: Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
299: Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.
300: BRUTUS: You are my true and honourable wife,
301: As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
302: That visit my sad heart
303: PORTIA: If this were true, then should I know this secret.
304: I grant I am a woman; but withal
305: A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:
306: I grant I am a woman; but withal
307: A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.
308: Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
309: Being so father'd and so husbanded?
310: Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:
311: I have made strong proof of my constancy,
312: Giving myself a voluntary wound
313: Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.
314: And not my husband's secrets?
315: BRUTUS: O ye gods,
316: Render me worthy of this noble wife!
317: Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;
318: And by and by thy bosom shall partake
319: The secrets of my heart.
320: All my engagements I will construe to thee,
321: All the charactery of my sad brows:
322: Leave me with haste.
323: Lucius, who's that knocks?
324: LUCIUS: He is a sick man that would speak with you.
325: BRUTUS: Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
326: Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?
327: LIGARIUS: Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
328: BRUTUS: O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
329: To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!
330: LIGARIUS: I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
331: Any exploit worthy the name of honour.
332: BRUTUS: Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
333: Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.
334: LIGARIUS: By all the gods that Romans bow before,
335: I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!
336: Brave son, derived from honourable loins!
337: Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up
338: My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,
339: And I will strive with things impossible;
340: Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?
341: BRUTUS: A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
342: LIGARIUS: But are not some whole that we must make sick?
343: BRUTUS: That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
344: I shall unfold to thee, as we are going
345: To whom it must be done.
346: LIGARIUS: Set on your foot,
347: And with a heart new-fired I follow you,
348: To do I know not what: but it sufficeth
349: That Brutus leads me on.
350: BRUTUS: Follow me, then.
ACT 2 SCENE 2

1: CAESAR: Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:
2: Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,
3: 'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?
4: Servant: My lord?
5: CAESAR: Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
6: And bring me their opinions of success.
7: Servant: I will, my lord.
8: CALPURNIA: What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth?
9: You shall not stir out of your house to-day.
10: CAESAR: Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
11: Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see
12: The face of Caesar, they are vanished.
13: CALPURNIA: Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,
14: Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
15: Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
16: Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
17: A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
18: And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;
19: Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,
20: In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
21: Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;
22: The noise of battle hurtled in the air,
23: Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
24: And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
25: O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
26: And I do fear them.
27: CAESAR: What can be avoided
28: Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
29: Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions
30: Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
31: CALPURNIA: When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
32: The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.
33: CAESAR: Cowards die many times before their deaths;
34: The valiant never taste of death but once.
35: Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
36: It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
37: Seeing that death, a necessary end,
38: Will come when it will come.
39: What say the augurers?
40: Servant: They would not have you to stir forth to-day.
41: Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
42: They could not find a heart within the beast.
43: CAESAR: The gods do this in shame of cowardice:
44: Caesar should be a beast without a heart,
45: If he should stay at home to-day for fear.
46: No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well
47: That Caesar is more dangerous than he:
48: We are two lions litter'd in one day,
49: And I the elder and more terrible:
50: And Caesar shall go forth.
51: CALPURNIA: Alas, my lord,
52: Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
53: Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear
54: That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
55: We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:
56: And he shall say you are not well to-day:
57: Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
58: CAESAR: Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
59: And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.
60: Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.
61: DECIUS BRUTUS: Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar:
62: I come to fetch you to the senate-house.
63: CAESAR: And you are come in very happy time,
64: To bear my greeting to the senators
65: And tell them that I will not come to-day:
66: Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:
67: I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.
68: CALPURNIA: Say he is sick.
69: CAESAR: Shall Caesar send a lie?
70: Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,
71: To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?
72: Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
73: DECIUS BRUTUS: Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
74: Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.
75: CAESAR: The cause is in my will: I will not come;
76: That is enough to satisfy the senate.
77: But for your private satisfaction,
78: Because I love you, I will let you know:
79: Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:
80: She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,
81: Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,
82: Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans
83: Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:
84: And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,
85: And evils imminent; and on her knee
86: Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.
87: DECIUS BRUTUS: This dream is all amiss interpreted;
88: It was a vision fair and fortunate:
89: Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
90: In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
91: Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
92: Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
93: For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.
94: This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.
95: CAESAR: And this way have you well expounded it.
96: DECIUS BRUTUS: I have, when you have heard what I can say:
97: And know it now: the senate have concluded
98: To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
99: If you shall send them word you will not come,
100: Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
101: Apt to be render'd, for some one to say
102: 'Break up the senate till another time,
103: When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'
104: If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
105: 'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?
106: Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love
107: To our proceeding bids me tell you this;
108: And reason to my love is liable.
109: CAESAR: How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!
110: I am ashamed I did yield to them.
111: Give me my robe, for I will go.
112: And look where Publius is come to fetch me.
113: PUBLIUS: Good morrow, Caesar.
114: CAESAR: Welcome, Publius.
115: What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?
116: Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,
117: Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy
118: As that same ague which hath made you lean.
119: What is 't o'clock?
120: BRUTUS: Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.
121: CAESAR: I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
122: See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,
123: Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.
124: ANTONY: So to most noble Caesar.
125: CAESAR: Bid them prepare within:
126: I am to blame to be thus waited for.
127: Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what, Trebonius!
128: I have an hour's talk in store for you;
129: Remember that you call on me to-day:
130: Be near me, that I may remember you.
131: TREBONIUS: Caesar, I will:
132: and so near will I be,
133: That your best friends shall wish I had been further.
134: CAESAR: Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;
135: And we, like friends, will straightway go together.
136: BRUTUS: [Aside] That every like is not the same, O Caesar,
137: The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!
ACT 2 SCENE 3

1: ARTEMIDORUS: 'Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius;
2: come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna, trust not
3: Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus
4: loves thee not: thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.
5: There is but one mind in all these men, and it is
6: bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal,
7: look about you: security gives way to conspiracy.
8: The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover,
9: 'ARTEMIDORUS.'
10: Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,
11: And as a suitor will I give him this.
12: My heart laments that virtue cannot live
13: Out of the teeth of emulation.
14: If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live;
15: If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.
ACT 2 SCENE 4

1: PORTIA: I prithee, boy, run to the senate-house;
2: Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone:
3: Why dost thou stay?
4: LUCIUS: To know my errand, madam.
5: PORTIA: I would have had thee there, and here again,
6: Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
7: O constancy, be strong upon my side,
8: Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!
9: I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
10: How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
11: Art thou here yet?
12: LUCIUS: Madam, what should I do?
13: Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
14: And so return to you, and nothing else?
15: PORTIA: Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
16: For he went sickly forth: and take good note
17: What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
18: Hark, boy! what noise is that?
19: LUCIUS: I hear none, madam.
20: PORTIA: Prithee, listen well;
21: I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,
22: And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
23: LUCIUS: Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
24: PORTIA: Come hither, fellow: which way hast thou been?
25: Soothsayer: At mine own house, good lady.
26: PORTIA: What is't o'clock?
27: Soothsayer: About the ninth hour, lady.
28: PORTIA: Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
29: Soothsayer: Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand,
30: To see him pass on to the Capitol.
31: PORTIA: Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
32: Soothsayer: That I have, lady: if it will please Caesar
33: To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,
34: I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
35: PORTIA: Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?
36: Soothsayer: None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
37: Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:
38: The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
39: Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,
40: Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:
41: I'll get me to a place more void, and there
42: Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
ACT 3 SCENE 3

1: CINNA THE POET: I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar,
2: And things unlucky charge my fantasy:
3: I have no will to wander forth of doors,
4: Yet something leads me forth.
5: First Citizen: What is your name?
6: Second Citizen: Whither are you going?
7: Third Citizen: Where do you dwell?
8: Fourth Citizen: Are you a married man or a bachelor?
9: Second Citizen: Answer every man directly.
10: First Citizen: Ay, and briefly.
11: Fourth Citizen: Ay, and wisely.
12: Third Citizen: Ay, and truly, you were best.
13: CINNA THE POET: What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I
14: dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to
15: answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and
16: truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
17: Second Citizen: That's as much as to say, they are fools that marry:
18: you'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed; directly.
19: CINNA THE POET: Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.
20: First Citizen: As a friend or an enemy?
21: CINNA THE POET: As a friend.
22: Second Citizen: That matter is answered directly.
23: Fourth Citizen: For your dwelling,--briefly.
24: CINNA THE POET: Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
25: Third Citizen: Your name, sir, truly.
26: CINNA THE POET: Truly, my name is Cinna.
27: First Citizen: Tear him to pieces; he's a conspirator.
28: CINNA THE POET: I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.
29: Fourth Citizen: Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.
30: CINNA THE POET: I am not Cinna the conspirator.
31: Fourth Citizen: It is no matter, his name's Cinna; pluck but his
32: name out of his heart, and turn him going.
ACT 4 SCENE 1

1: ANTONY: These many, then, shall die; their names are prick'd.
2: OCTAVIUS: Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?
3: LEPIDUS: I do consent--
4: OCTAVIUS: Prick him down, Antony.
5: LEPIDUS: Upon condition Publius shall not live,
6: Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.
7: ANTONY: He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
8: But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;
9: Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
10: How to cut off some charge in legacies.
11: LEPIDUS: What, shall I find you here?
12: OCTAVIUS: Or here, or at the Capitol.
13: ANTONY: This is a slight unmeritable man,
14: Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,
15: The three-fold world divided, he should stand
16: One of the three to share it?
17: OCTAVIUS: So you thought him;
18: And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,
19: In our black sentence and proscription.
20: ANTONY: Octavius, I have seen more days than you:
21: And though we lay these honours on this man,
22: To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,
23: He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
24: To groan and sweat under the business,
25: Either led or driven, as we point the way;
26: And having brought our treasure where we will,
27: Then take we down his load, and turn him off,
28: Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,
29: And graze in commons.
30: OCTAVIUS: You may do your will;
31: But he's a tried and valiant soldier.
32: ANTONY: So is my horse, Octavius; and for that
33: I do appoint him store of provender:
34: It is a creature that I teach to fight,
35: To wind, to stop, to run directly on,
36: His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
37: And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;
38: He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;
39: A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds
40: On abjects, orts and imitations,
41: Which, out of use and staled by other men,
42: Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,
43: But as a property. And now, Octavius,
44: Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius
45: Are levying powers: we must straight make head:
46: Therefore let our alliance be combined,
47: Our best friends made, our means stretch'd
48: And let us presently go sit in council,
49: How covert matters may be best disclosed,
50: And open perils surest answered.
51: OCTAVIUS: Let us do so: for we are at the stake,
52: And bay'd about with many enemies;
53: And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,
54: Millions of mischiefs.
ACT 4 SCENE 2

1: BRUTUS: Stand, ho!
2: LUCILIUS: Give the word, ho! and stand.
3: BRUTUS: What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?
4: LUCILIUS: He is at hand; and Pindarus is come
5: To do you salutation from his master.
6: BRUTUS: He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
7: In his own change, or by ill officers,
8: Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
9: Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,
10: I shall be satisfied.
11: PINDARUS: I do not doubt
12: But that my noble master will appear
13: Such as he is, full of regard and honour.
14: BRUTUS: He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;
15: How he received you, let me be resolved.
16: LUCILIUS: With courtesy and with respect enough;
17: But not with such familiar instances,
18: Nor with such free and friendly conference,
19: As he hath used of old.
20: BRUTUS: Thou hast described
21: A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,
22: When love begins to sicken and decay,
23: It useth an enforced ceremony.
24: There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
25: But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
26: Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
27: But when they should endure the bloody spur,
28: They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,
29: Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?
30: LUCILIUS: They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd;
31: The greater part, the horse in general,
32: Are come with Cassius.
33: BRUTUS: Hark! he is arrived.
34: March gently on to meet him.
35: CASSIUS: Stand, ho!
36: BRUTUS: Stand, ho! Speak the word along.
37: First Soldier: Stand!
38: Second Soldier: Stand!
39: Third Soldier: Stand!
40: CASSIUS: Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
41: BRUTUS: Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?
42: And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?
43: CASSIUS: Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;
44: And when you do them--
45: BRUTUS: Cassius, be content.
46: Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.
47: Before the eyes of both our armies here,
48: Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
49: Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;
50: Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
51: And I will give you audience.
52: CASSIUS: Pindarus,
53: Bid our commanders lead their charges off
54: A little from this ground.
55: BRUTUS: Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man
56: Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
57: Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.
ACT 4 SCENE 3

1: CASSIUS: That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
2: You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
3: For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
4: Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
5: Because I knew the man, were slighted off.
6: BRUTUS: You wronged yourself to write in such a case.
7: CASSIUS: In such a time as this it is not meet
8: That every nice offence should bear his comment.
9: BRUTUS: Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
10: Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;
11: To sell and mart your offices for gold
12: To undeservers.
13: CASSIUS: I an itching palm!
14: You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
15: Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
16: BRUTUS: The name of Cassius honours this corruption,
17: And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
18: CASSIUS: Chastisement!
19: BRUTUS: Remember March, the ides of March remember:
20: Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
21: What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,
22: And not for justice? What, shall one of us
23: That struck the foremost man of all this world
24: But for supporting robbers, shall we now
25: Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,
26: And sell the mighty space of our large honours
27: For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
28: I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
29: Than such a Roman.
30: CASSIUS: Brutus, bay not me;
31: I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,
32: To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,
33: Older in practise, abler than yourself
34: To make conditions.
35: BRUTUS: Go to; you are not, Cassius.
36: CASSIUS: I am.
37: BRUTUS: I say you are not.
38: CASSIUS: Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
39: Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.
40: BRUTUS: Away, slight man!
41: CASSIUS: Is't possible?
42: BRUTUS: Hear me, for I will speak.
43: Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
44: Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
45: CASSIUS: O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?
46: BRUTUS: All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;
47: Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
48: And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
49: Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch
50: Under your testy humour? By the gods
51: You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
52: Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
53: I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
54: When you are waspish.
55: CASSIUS: Is it come to this?
56: BRUTUS: You say you are a better soldier:
57: Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
58: And it shall please me well: for mine own part,
59: I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
60: CASSIUS: You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;
61: I said, an elder soldier, not a better:
62: Did I say 'better'?
63: BRUTUS: If you did, I care not.
64: CASSIUS: When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
65: BRUTUS: Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.
66: CASSIUS: I durst not!
67: BRUTUS: No.
68: CASSIUS: What, durst not tempt him!
69: BRUTUS: For your life you durst not!
70: CASSIUS: Do not presume too much upon my love;
71: I may do that I shall be sorry for.
72: BRUTUS: You have done that you should be sorry for.
73: There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
74: For I am arm'd so strong in honesty
75: That they pass by me as the idle wind,
76: Which I respect not. I did send to you
77: For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:
78: For I can raise no money by vile means:
79: By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
80: And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
81: From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
82: By any indirection: I did send
83: To you for gold to pay my legions,
84: Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?
85: Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
86: When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
87: To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
88: Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;
89: Dash him to pieces!
90: CASSIUS: I denied you not.
91: BRUTUS: You did.
92: CASSIUS: I did not: he was but a fool that brought
93: My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:
94: A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
95: But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
96: BRUTUS: I do not, till you practise them on me.
97: CASSIUS: You love me not.
98: BRUTUS: I do not like your faults.
99: CASSIUS: A friendly eye could never see such faults.
100: BRUTUS: A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
101: As huge as high Olympus.
102: CASSIUS: Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
103: Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
104: For Cassius is aweary of the world;
105: Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
106: Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,
107: Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,
108: To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
109: My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,
110: And here my naked breast; within, a heart
111: Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
112: If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;
113: I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:
114: Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,
115: When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
116: Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
117: BRUTUS: Sheathe your dagger:
118: Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
119: Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.
120: O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
121: That carries anger as the flint bears fire;
122: Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
123: And straight is cold again.
124: CASSIUS: Hath Cassius lived
125: To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
126: When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?
127: BRUTUS: When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
128: CASSIUS: Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
129: BRUTUS: And my heart too.
130: CASSIUS: O Brutus!
131: BRUTUS: What's the matter?
132: CASSIUS: Have not you love enough to bear with me,
133: When that rash humour which my mother gave me
134: Makes me forgetful?
135: BRUTUS: Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,
136: When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,
137: He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.
138: Poet: [Within] Let me go in to see the generals;
139: There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet
140: They be alone.
141: LUCILIUS: [Within] You shall not come to them.
142: Poet: [Within] Nothing but death shall stay me.
143: CASSIUS: How now! what's the matter?
144: Poet: For shame, you generals! what do you mean?
145: Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;
146: For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.
147: CASSIUS: Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
148: BRUTUS: Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
149: CASSIUS: Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
150: BRUTUS: I'll know his humour, when he knows his time:
151: What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
152: Companion, hence!
153: CASSIUS: Away, away, be gone.
154: BRUTUS: Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
155: Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.
156: CASSIUS: And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you
157: Immediately to us.
158: BRUTUS: Lucius, a bowl of wine!
159: CASSIUS: I did not think you could have been so angry.
160: BRUTUS: O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
161: CASSIUS: Of your philosophy you make no use,
162: If you give place to accidental evils.
163: BRUTUS: No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
164: CASSIUS: Ha! Portia!
165: BRUTUS: She is dead.
166: CASSIUS: How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?
167: O insupportable and touching loss!
168: Upon what sickness?
169: BRUTUS: Impatient of my absence,
170: And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
171: Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death
172: That tidings came;--with this she fell distract,
173: And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.
174: CASSIUS: And died so?
175: BRUTUS: Even so.
176: CASSIUS: O ye immortal gods!
177: BRUTUS: Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
178: In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.
179: CASSIUS: My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
180: Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;
181: I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.
182: BRUTUS: Come in, Titinius!
183: Welcome, good Messala.
184: Now sit we close about this taper here,
185: And call in question our necessities.
186: CASSIUS: Portia, art thou gone?
187: BRUTUS: No more, I pray you.
188: Messala, I have here received letters,
189: That young Octavius and Mark Antony
190: Come down upon us with a mighty power,
191: Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
192: MESSALA: Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.
193: BRUTUS: With what addition?
194: MESSALA: That by proscription and bills of outlawry,
195: Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,
196: Have put to death an hundred senators.
197: BRUTUS: Therein our letters do not well agree;
198: Mine speak of seventy senators that died
199: By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
200: CASSIUS: Cicero one!
201: MESSALA: Cicero is dead,
202: And by that order of proscription.
203: Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
204: BRUTUS: No, Messala.
205: MESSALA: Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
206: BRUTUS: Nothing, Messala.
207: MESSALA: That, methinks, is strange.
208: BRUTUS: Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?
209: MESSALA: No, my lord.
210: BRUTUS: Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
211: MESSALA: Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
212: For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
213: BRUTUS: Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:
214: With meditating that she must die once,
215: I have the patience to endure it now.
216: MESSALA: Even so great men great losses should endure.
217: CASSIUS: I have as much of this in art as you,
218: But yet my nature could not bear it so.
219: BRUTUS: Well, to our work alive. What do you think
220: Of marching to Philippi presently?
221: CASSIUS: I do not think it good.
222: BRUTUS: Your reason?
223: CASSIUS: This it is:
224: 'Tis better that the enemy seek us:
225: So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
226: Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,
227: Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
228: BRUTUS: Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.
229: The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
230: Do stand but in a forced affection;
231: For they have grudged us contribution:
232: The enemy, marching along by them,
233: By them shall make a fuller number up,
234: Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;
235: From which advantage shall we cut him off,
236: If at Philippi we do face him there,
237: These people at our back.
238: CASSIUS: Hear me, good brother.
239: BRUTUS: Under your pardon. You must note beside,
240: That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
241: Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:
242: The enemy increaseth every day;
243: We, at the height, are ready to decline.
244: There is a tide in the affairs of men,
245: Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
246: Omitted, all the voyage of their life
247: Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
248: On such a full sea are we now afloat;
249: And we must take the current when it serves,
250: Or lose our ventures.
251: CASSIUS: Then, with your will, go on;
252: We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.
253: BRUTUS: The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
254: And nature must obey necessity;
255: Which we will niggard with a little rest.
256: There is no more to say?
257: CASSIUS: No more. Good night:
258: Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
259: BRUTUS: Lucius!
260: My gown.
261: Farewell, good Messala:
262: Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,
263: Good night, and good repose.
264: CASSIUS: O my dear brother!
265: This was an ill beginning of the night:
266: Never come such division 'tween our souls!
267: Let it not, Brutus.
268: BRUTUS: Every thing is well.
269: CASSIUS: Good night, my lord.
270: BRUTUS: Good night, good brother.
271: MESSALA: Good night, Lord Brutus.
272: BRUTUS: Farewell, every one.
273: Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?
274: LUCIUS: Here in the tent.
275: BRUTUS: What, thou speak'st drowsily?
276: Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'er-watch'd.
277: Call Claudius and some other of my men:
278: I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
279: LUCIUS: Varro and Claudius!
280: VARRO: Calls my lord?
281: BRUTUS: I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
282: It may be I shall raise you by and by
283: On business to my brother Cassius.
284: VARRO: So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
285: BRUTUS: I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;
286: It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
287: Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;
288: I put it in the pocket of my gown.
289: LUCIUS: I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
290: BRUTUS: Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
291: Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,
292: And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
293: LUCIUS: Ay, my lord, an't please you.
294: BRUTUS: It does, my boy:
295: I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
296: LUCIUS: It is my duty, sir.
297: BRUTUS: I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
298: I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
299: LUCIUS: I have slept, my lord, already.
300: BRUTUS: It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;
301: I will not hold thee long: if I do live,
302: I will be good to thee.
303: This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,
304: Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
305: That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;
306: I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
307: If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
308: I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
309: Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
310: Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.
311: How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?
312: I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
313: That shapes this monstrous apparition.
314: It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?
315: Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,
316: That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
317: Speak to me what thou art.
318: GHOST: Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
319: BRUTUS: Why comest thou?
320: GHOST: To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
321: BRUTUS: Well; then I shall see thee again?
322: GHOST: Ay, at Philippi.
323: BRUTUS: Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.
324: Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:
325: Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.
326: Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!
327: LUCIUS: The strings, my lord, are false.
328: BRUTUS: He thinks he still is at his instrument.
329: Lucius, awake!
330: LUCIUS: My lord?
331: BRUTUS: Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
332: LUCIUS: My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
333: BRUTUS: Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?
334: LUCIUS: Nothing, my lord.
335: BRUTUS: Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!
336: Fellow thou, awake!
337: VARRO: My lord?
338: CLAUDIUS: My lord?
339: BRUTUS: Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
340: CLAUDIUS: Did we, my lord?
341: BRUTUS: Ay: saw you any thing?
342: VARRO: No, my lord, I saw nothing.
343: CLAUDIUS: Nor I, my lord.
344: BRUTUS: Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
345: Bid him set on his powers betimes before,
346: And we will follow.
ACT 5 SCENE 1

1: OCTAVIUS: Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:
2: You said the enemy would not come down,
3: But keep the hills and upper regions;
4: It proves not so: their battles are at hand;
5: They mean to warn us at Philippi here,
6: Answering before we do demand of them.
7: ANTONY: Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
8: Wherefore they do it: they could be content
9: To visit other places; and come down
10: With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
11: To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
12: But 'tis not so.
13: Messenger: Prepare you, generals:
14: The enemy comes on in gallant show;
15: Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,
16: And something to be done immediately.
17: ANTONY: Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
18: Upon the left hand of the even field.
19: OCTAVIUS: Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.
20: ANTONY: Why do you cross me in this exigent?
21: OCTAVIUS: I do not cross you; but I will do so.
22: BRUTUS: They stand, and would have parley.
23: CASSIUS: Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.
24: OCTAVIUS: Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
25: ANTONY: No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
26: Make forth; the generals would have some words.
27: OCTAVIUS: Stir not until the signal.
28: BRUTUS: Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?
29: OCTAVIUS: Not that we love words better, as you do.
30: BRUTUS: Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
31: ANTONY: In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:
32: Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,
33: Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'
34: CASSIUS: Antony,
35: The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
36: But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
37: And leave them honeyless.
38: ANTONY: Not stingless too.
39: BRUTUS: O, yes, and soundless too;
40: For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,
41: And very wisely threat before you sting.
42: ANTONY: Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers
43: Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:
44: You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,
45: And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;
46: Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind
47: Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!
48: CASSIUS: Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:
49: This tongue had not offended so to-day,
50: If Cassius might have ruled.
51: OCTAVIUS: Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,
52: The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;
53: I draw a sword against conspirators;
54: When think you that the sword goes up again?
55: Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds
56: Be well avenged; or till another Caesar
57: Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
58: BRUTUS: Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
59: Unless thou bring'st them with thee.
60: OCTAVIUS: So I hope;
61: I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
62: BRUTUS: O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
63: Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.
64: CASSIUS: A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,
65: Join'd with a masker and a reveller!
66: ANTONY: Old Cassius still!
67: OCTAVIUS: Come, Antony, away!
68: Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:
69: If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;
70: If not, when you have stomachs.
71: CASSIUS: Why, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!
72: The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.
73: BRUTUS: Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you.
74: LUCILIUS: [Standing forth] My lord?
75: CASSIUS: Messala!
76: MESSALA: [Standing forth] What says my general?
77: CASSIUS: Messala,
78: This is my birth-day; as this very day
79: Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:
80: Be thou my witness that against my will,
81: As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set
82: Upon one battle all our liberties.
83: You know that I held Epicurus strong
84: And his opinion: now I change my mind,
85: And partly credit things that do presage.
86: Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
87: Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,
88: Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;
89: Who to Philippi here consorted us:
90: This morning are they fled away and gone;
91: And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,
92: Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,
93: As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
94: A canopy most fatal, under which
95: Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.
96: MESSALA: Believe not so.
97: CASSIUS: I but believe it partly;
98: For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
99: To meet all perils very constantly.
100: BRUTUS: Even so, Lucilius.
101: CASSIUS: Now, most noble Brutus,
102: The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,
103: Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
104: But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
105: Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
106: If we do lose this battle, then is this
107: The very last time we shall speak together:
108: What are you then determined to do?
109: BRUTUS: Even by the rule of that philosophy
110: By which I did blame Cato for the death
111: Which he did give himself, I know not how,
112: But I do find it cowardly and vile,
113: For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
114: The time of life: arming myself with patience
115: To stay the providence of some high powers
116: That govern us below.
117: CASSIUS: Then, if we lose this battle,
118: You are contented to be led in triumph
119: Thorough the streets of Rome?
120: BRUTUS: No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,
121: That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
122: He bears too great a mind. But this same day
123: Must end that work the ides of March begun;
124: And whether we shall meet again I know not.
125: Therefore our everlasting farewell take:
126: For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!
127: If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
128: If not, why then, this parting was well made.
129: CASSIUS: For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!
130: If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
131: If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.
132: BRUTUS: Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know
133: The end of this day's business ere it come!
134: But it sufficeth that the day will end,
135: And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!
ACT 5 SCENE 2

1: BRUTUS: Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
2: Unto the legions on the other side.
3: Let them set on at once; for I perceive
4: But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,
5: And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
6: Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.
ACT 5 SCENE 3

1: CASSIUS: O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
2: Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:
3: This ensign here of mine was turning back;
4: I slew the coward, and did take it from him.
5: TITINIUS: O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;
6: Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
7: Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,
8: Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
9: PINDARUS: Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
10: Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord
11: Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.
12: CASSIUS: This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;
13: Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
14: TITINIUS: They are, my lord.
15: CASSIUS: Titinius, if thou lovest me,
16: Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,
17: Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops,
18: And here again; that I may rest assured
19: Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
20: TITINIUS: I will be here again, even with a thought.
21: CASSIUS: Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
22: My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,
23: And tell me what thou notest about the field.
24: This day I breathed first: time is come round,
25: And where I did begin, there shall I end;
26: My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?
27: PINDARUS: [Above] O my lord!
28: CASSIUS: What news?
29: PINDARUS: [Above] Titinius is enclosed round about
30: With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;
31: Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.
32: Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.
33: He's ta'en.
34: And, hark! they shout for joy.
35: CASSIUS: Come down, behold no more.
36: O, coward that I am, to live so long,
37: To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
38: Come hither, sirrah:
39: In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;
40: And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,
41: That whatsoever I did bid thee do,
42: Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;
43: Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,
44: That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.
45: Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;
46: And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,
47: Guide thou the sword.
48: Caesar, thou art revenged,
49: Even with the sword that kill'd thee.
50: PINDARUS: So, I am free; yet would not so have been,
51: Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,
52: Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
53: Where never Roman shall take note of him.
54: MESSALA: It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius
55: Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,
56: As Cassius' legions are by Antony.
57: TITINIUS: These tidings will well comfort Cassius.
58: MESSALA: Where did you leave him?
59: TITINIUS: All disconsolate,
60: With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.
61: MESSALA: Is not that he t hat lies upon the ground?
62: TITINIUS: He lies not like the living. O my heart!
63: MESSALA: Is not that he?
64: TITINIUS: No, this was he, Messala,
65: But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,
66: As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,
67: So in his red blood Cassius' day is set;
68: The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;
69: Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!
70: Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
71: MESSALA: Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
72: O hateful error, melancholy's child,
73: Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
74: The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,
75: Thou never comest unto a happy birth,
76: But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!
77: TITINIUS: What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?
78: MESSALA: Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
79: The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
80: Into his ears; I may say, thrusting it;
81: For piercing steel and darts envenomed
82: Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
83: As tidings of this sight.
84: TITINIUS: Hie you, Messala,
85: And I will seek for Pindarus the while.
86: Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
87: Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they
88: Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
89: And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
90: Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!
91: But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
92: Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
93: Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
94: And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
95: By your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's part
96: Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
97: BRUTUS: Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
98: MESSALA: Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
99: BRUTUS: Titinius' face is upward.
100: CATO: He is slain.
101: BRUTUS: O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
102: Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
103: In our own proper entrails.
104: CATO: Brave Titinius!
105: Look, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!
106: BRUTUS: Are yet two Romans living such as these?
107: The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
108: It is impossible that ever Rome
109: Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears
110: To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
111: I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
112: Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:
113: His funerals shall not be in our camp,
114: Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;
115: And come, young Cato; let us to the field.
116: Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:
117: 'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night
118: We shall try fortune in a second fight.
ACT 5 SCENE 4

1: BRUTUS: Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
2: CATO: What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
3: I will proclaim my name about the field:
4: I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
5: A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend;
6: I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
7: BRUTUS: And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;
8: Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!
9: LUCILIUS: O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
10: Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius;
11: And mayst be honour'd, being Cato's son.
12: First Soldier: Yield, or thou diest.
13: LUCILIUS: Only I yield to die:
14: There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;
15: Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.
16: First Soldier: We must not. A noble prisoner!
17: Second Soldier: Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
18: First Soldier: I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.
19: Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.
20: ANTONY: Where is he?
21: LUCILIUS: Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
22: I dare assure thee that no enemy
23: Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:
24: The gods defend him from so great a shame!
25: When you do find him, or alive or dead,
26: He will be found like Brutus, like himself.
27: ANTONY: This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,
28: A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;
29: Give him all kindness: I had rather have
30: Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,
31: And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;
32: And bring us word unto Octavius' tent
33: How every thing is chanced.
ACT 5 SCENE 5

1: BRUTUS: Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
2: CLITUS: Statilius show'd the torch-light, but, my lord,
3: He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.
4: BRUTUS: Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word;
5: It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.
6: CLITUS: What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
7: BRUTUS: Peace then! no words.
8: CLITUS: I'll rather kill myself.
9: BRUTUS: Hark thee, Dardanius.
10: DARDANIUS: Shall I do such a deed?
11: CLITUS: O Dardanius!
12: DARDANIUS: O Clitus!
13: CLITUS: What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
14: DARDANIUS: To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
15: CLITUS: Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
16: That it runs over even at his eyes.
17: BRUTUS: Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word.
18: VOLUMNIUS: What says my lord?
19: BRUTUS: Why, this, Volumnius:
20: The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
21: Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
22: And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:
23: I know my hour is come.
24: VOLUMNIUS: Not so, my lord.
25: BRUTUS: Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
26: Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;
27: Our enemies have beat us to the pit:
28: It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,
29: Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
30: Thou know'st that we two went to school together:
31: Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
32: Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.
33: VOLUMNIUS: That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
34: CLITUS: Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.
35: BRUTUS: Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.
36: Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
37: Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,
38: My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
39: I found no man but he was true to me.
40: I shall have glory by this losing day
41: More than Octavius and Mark Antony
42: By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
43: So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue
44: Hath almost ended his life's history:
45: Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
46: That have but labour'd to attain this hour.
47: CLITUS: Fly, my lord, fly.
48: BRUTUS: Hence! I will follow.
49: I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:
50: Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
51: Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:
52: Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
53: While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?
54: STRATO: Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
55: BRUTUS: Farewell, good Strato.
56: Caesar, now be still:
57: I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.
58: OCTAVIUS: What man is that?
59: MESSALA: My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?
60: STRATO: Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
61: The conquerors can but make a fire of him;
62: For Brutus only overcame himself,
63: And no man else hath honour by his death.
64: LUCILIUS: So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
65: That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.
66: OCTAVIUS: All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
67: Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
68: STRATO: Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
69: OCTAVIUS: Do so, good Messala.
70: MESSALA: How died my master, Strato?
71: STRATO: I held the sword, and he did run on it.
72: MESSALA: Octavius, then take him to follow thee,
73: That did the latest service to my master.
74: ANTONY: This was the noblest Roman of them all:
75: All the conspirators save only he
76: Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;
77: He only, in a general honest thought
78: And common good to all, made one of them.
79: His life was gentle, and the elements
80: So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
81: And say to all the world 'This was a man!'
