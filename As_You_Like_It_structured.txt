ACT 1 SCENE 1

1: ORLANDO: As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
2: bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
3: and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
4: blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
5: sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
6: report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
7: he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
8: properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
9: that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
10: differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
11: are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
12: with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
13: and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
14: brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the
15: which his animals on his dunghills are as much
16: bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
17: plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
18: me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
19: me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
20: brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
21: gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
22: grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I
23: think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
24: servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
25: know no wise remedy how to avoid it.
26: ADAM: Yonder comes my master, your brother.
27: ORLANDO: Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will
28: shake me up.
29: OLIVER: Now, sir! what make you here?
30: ORLANDO: Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.
31: OLIVER: What mar you then, sir?
32: ORLANDO: Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God
33: made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
34: OLIVER: Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.
35: ORLANDO: Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
36: What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should
37: come to such penury?
38: OLIVER: Know you where your are, sir?
39: ORLANDO: O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
40: OLIVER: Know you before whom, sir?
41: ORLANDO: Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know
42: you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle
43: condition of blood, you should so know me. The
44: courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that
45: you are the first-born; but the same tradition
46: takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers
47: betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as
48: you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is
49: nearer to his reverence.
50: OLIVER: What, boy!
51: ORLANDO: Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
52: OLIVER: Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
53: ORLANDO: I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir
54: Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice
55: a villain that says such a father begot villains.
56: Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand
57: from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
58: tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.
59: ADAM: Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's
60: remembrance, be at accord.
61: OLIVER: Let me go, I say.
62: ORLANDO: I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My
63: father charged you in his will to give me good
64: education: you have trained me like a peasant,
65: obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
66: qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
67: me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow
68: me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
69: give me the poor allottery my father left me by
70: testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.
71: OLIVER: And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?
72: Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled
73: with you; you shall have some part of your will: I
74: pray you, leave me.
75: ORLANDO: I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
76: OLIVER: Get you with him, you old dog.
77: ADAM: Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my
78: teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
79: he would not have spoke such a word.
80: OLIVER: Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will
81: physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand
82: crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!
83: DENNIS: Calls your worship?
84: OLIVER: Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?
85: DENNIS: So please you, he is here at the door and importunes
86: access to you.
87: OLIVER: Call him in.
88: 'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.
89: CHARLES: Good morrow to your worship.
90: OLIVER: Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the
91: new court?
92: CHARLES: There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:
93: that is, the old duke is banished by his younger
94: brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords
95: have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,
96: whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;
97: therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
98: OLIVER: Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be
99: banished with her father?
100: CHARLES: O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves
101: her, being ever from their cradles bred together,
102: that she would have followed her exile, or have died
103: to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no
104: less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and
105: never two ladies loved as they do.
106: OLIVER: Where will the old duke live?
107: CHARLES: They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and
108: a many merry men with him; and there they live like
109: the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young
110: gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time
111: carelessly, as they did in the golden world.
112: OLIVER: What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?
113: CHARLES: Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
114: matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
115: that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
116: to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
117: To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that
118: escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
119: well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,
120: for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I
121: must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,
122: out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you
123: withal, that either you might stay him from his
124: intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
125: run into, in that it is a thing of his own search
126: and altogether against my will.
127: OLIVER: Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
128: thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
129: myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
130: have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
131: it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:
132: it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full
133: of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's
134: good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against
135: me his natural brother: therefore use thy
136: discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck
137: as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if
138: thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
139: mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise
140: against thee by poison, entrap thee by some
141: treacherous device and never leave thee till he
142: hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;
143: for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak
144: it, there is not one so young and so villanous this
145: day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but
146: should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must
147: blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.
148: CHARLES: I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
149: to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go
150: alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and
151: so God keep your worship!
152: OLIVER: Farewell, good Charles.
153: Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see
154: an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
155: hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never
156: schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of
157: all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much
158: in the heart of the world, and especially of my own
159: people, who best know him, that I am altogether
160: misprised: but it shall not be so long; this
161: wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that
162: I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.
ACT 1 SCENE 2

1: CELIA: I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
2: ROSALIND: Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;
3: and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
4: teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
5: learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
6: CELIA: Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
7: that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
8: had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
9: hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
10: love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
11: if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
12: tempered as mine is to thee.
13: ROSALIND: Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
14: rejoice in yours.
15: CELIA: You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is
16: like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
17: be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
18: father perforce, I will render thee again in
19: affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break
20: that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my
21: sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.
22: ROSALIND: From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let
23: me see; what think you of falling in love?
24: CELIA: Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but
25: love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport
26: neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
27: in honour come off again.
28: ROSALIND: What shall be our sport, then?
29: CELIA: Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
30: her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
31: ROSALIND: I would we could do so, for her benefits are
32: mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
33: doth most mistake in her gifts to women.
34: CELIA: 'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce
35: makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
36: makes very ill-favouredly.
37: ROSALIND: Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to
38: Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,
39: not in the lineaments of Nature.
40: CELIA: No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she
41: not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
42: hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not
43: Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?
44: ROSALIND: Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
45: Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of
46: Nature's wit.
47: CELIA: Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
48: Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
49: to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
50: natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of
51: the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,
52: wit! whither wander you?
53: TOUCHSTONE: Mistress, you must come away to your father.
54: CELIA: Were you made the messenger?
55: TOUCHSTONE: No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.
56: ROSALIND: Where learned you that oath, fool?
57: TOUCHSTONE: Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
58: were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
59: mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the
60: pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and
61: yet was not the knight forsworn.
62: CELIA: How prove you that, in the great heap of your
63: knowledge?
64: ROSALIND: Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
65: TOUCHSTONE: Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and
66: swear by your beards that I am a knave.
67: CELIA: By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
68: TOUCHSTONE: By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you
69: swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
70: more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he
71: never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away
72: before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.
73: CELIA: Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?
74: TOUCHSTONE: One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
75: CELIA: My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!
76: speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation
77: one of these days.
78: TOUCHSTONE: The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what
79: wise men do foolishly.
80: CELIA: By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little
81: wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
82: that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
83: Monsieur Le Beau.
84: ROSALIND: With his mouth full of news.
85: CELIA: Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.
86: ROSALIND: Then shall we be news-crammed.
87: CELIA: All the better; we shall be the more marketable.
88: Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?
89: LE BEAU: Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.
90: CELIA: Sport! of what colour?
91: LE BEAU: What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?
92: ROSALIND: As wit and fortune will.
93: TOUCHSTONE: Or as the Destinies decree.
94: CELIA: Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.
95: TOUCHSTONE: Nay, if I keep not my rank,--
96: ROSALIND: Thou losest thy old smell.
97: LE BEAU: You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good
98: wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
99: ROSALIND: You tell us the manner of the wrestling.
100: LE BEAU: I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please
101: your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is
102: yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming
103: to perform it.
104: CELIA: Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
105: LE BEAU: There comes an old man and his three sons,--
106: CELIA: I could match this beginning with an old tale.
107: LE BEAU: Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.
108: ROSALIND: With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men
109: by these presents.'
110: LE BEAU: The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the
111: duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him
112: and broke three of his ribs, that there is little
113: hope of life in him: so he served the second, and
114: so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
115: their father, making such pitiful dole over them
116: that all the beholders take his part with weeping.
117: ROSALIND: Alas!
118: TOUCHSTONE: But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies
119: have lost?
120: LE BEAU: Why, this that I speak of.
121: TOUCHSTONE: Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first
122: time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
123: for ladies.
124: CELIA: Or I, I promise thee.
125: ROSALIND: But is there any else longs to see this broken music
126: in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
127: rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?
128: LE BEAU: You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
129: appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to
130: perform it.
131: CELIA: Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.
132: DUKE FREDERICK: Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his
133: own peril on his forwardness.
134: ROSALIND: Is yonder the man?
135: LE BEAU: Even he, madam.
136: CELIA: Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.
137: DUKE FREDERICK: How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither
138: to see the wrestling?
139: ROSALIND: Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.
140: DUKE FREDERICK: You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;
141: there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
142: challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he
143: will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if
144: you can move him.
145: CELIA: Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
146: DUKE FREDERICK: Do so: I'll not be by.
147: LE BEAU: Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.
148: ORLANDO: I attend them with all respect and duty.
149: ROSALIND: Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?
150: ORLANDO: No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I
151: come but in, as others do, to try with him the
152: strength of my youth.
153: CELIA: Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your
154: years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's
155: strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or
156: knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your
157: adventure would counsel you to a more equal
158: enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to
159: embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.
160: ROSALIND: Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore
161: be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke
162: that the wrestling might not go forward.
163: ORLANDO: I beseech you, punish me not with your hard
164: thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny
165: so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let
166: your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
167: trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one
168: shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one
169: dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my
170: friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the
171: world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in
172: the world I fill up a place, which may be better
173: supplied when I have made it empty.
174: ROSALIND: The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.
175: CELIA: And mine, to eke out hers.
176: ROSALIND: Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!
177: CELIA: Your heart's desires be with you!
178: CHARLES: Come, where is this young gallant that is so
179: desirous to lie with his mother earth?
180: ORLANDO: Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.
181: DUKE FREDERICK: You shall try but one fall.
182: CHARLES: No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him
183: to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him
184: from a first.
185: ORLANDO: An you mean to mock me after, you should not have
186: mocked me before: but come your ways.
187: ROSALIND: Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!
188: CELIA: I would I were invisible, to catch the strong
189: fellow by the leg.
190: ROSALIND: O excellent young man!
191: CELIA: If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who
192: should down.
193: DUKE FREDERICK: No more, no more.
194: ORLANDO: Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.
195: DUKE FREDERICK: How dost thou, Charles?
196: LE BEAU: He cannot speak, my lord.
197: DUKE FREDERICK: Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?
198: ORLANDO: Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.
199: DUKE FREDERICK: I would thou hadst been son to some man else:
200: The world esteem'd thy father honourable,
201: But I did find him still mine enemy:
202: Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,
203: Hadst thou descended from another house.
204: But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:
205: I would thou hadst told me of another father.
206: CELIA: Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
207: ORLANDO: I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
208: His youngest son; and would not change that calling,
209: To be adopted heir to Frederick.
210: ROSALIND: My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,
211: And all the world was of my father's mind:
212: Had I before known this young man his son,
213: I should have given him tears unto entreaties,
214: Ere he should thus have ventured.
215: CELIA: Gentle cousin,
216: Let us go thank him and encourage him:
217: My father's rough and envious disposition
218: Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:
219: If you do keep your promises in love
220: But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,
221: Your mistress shall be happy.
222: ROSALIND: Gentleman,
223: Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,
224: That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
225: Shall we go, coz?
226: CELIA: Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.
227: ORLANDO: Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts
228: Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up
229: Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
230: ROSALIND: He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;
231: I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?
232: Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown
233: More than your enemies.
234: CELIA: Will you go, coz?
235: ROSALIND: Have with you. Fare you well.
236: ORLANDO: What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
237: I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.
238: O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
239: Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
240: LE BEAU: Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
241: To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
242: High commendation, true applause and love,
243: Yet such is now the duke's condition
244: That he misconstrues all that you have done.
245: The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,
246: More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
247: ORLANDO: I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:
248: Which of the two was daughter of the duke
249: That here was at the wrestling?
250: LE BEAU: Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;
251: But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
252: The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,
253: And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
254: To keep his daughter company; whose loves
255: Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
256: But I can tell you that of late this duke
257: Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
258: Grounded upon no other argument
259: But that the people praise her for her virtues
260: And pity her for her good father's sake;
261: And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
262: Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:
263: Hereafter, in a better world than this,
264: I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
265: ORLANDO: I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.
266: Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
267: From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:
268: But heavenly Rosalind!
ACT 1 SCENE 3

1: CELIA: Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?
2: ROSALIND: Not one to throw at a dog.
3: CELIA: No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon
4: curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.
5: ROSALIND: Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one
6: should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
7: without any.
8: CELIA: But is all this for your father?
9: ROSALIND: No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how
10: full of briers is this working-day world!
11: CELIA: They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in
12: holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden
13: paths our very petticoats will catch them.
14: ROSALIND: I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.
15: CELIA: Hem them away.
16: ROSALIND: I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.
17: CELIA: Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
18: ROSALIND: O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!
19: CELIA: O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in
20: despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of
21: service, let us talk in good earnest: is it
22: possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so
23: strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
24: ROSALIND: The duke my father loved his father dearly.
25: CELIA: Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
26: dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,
27: for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate
28: not Orlando.
29: ROSALIND: No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
30: CELIA: Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?
31: ROSALIND: Let me love him for that, and do you love him
32: because I do. Look, here comes the duke.
33: CELIA: With his eyes full of anger.
34: DUKE FREDERICK: Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste
35: And get you from our court.
36: ROSALIND: Me, uncle?
37: DUKE FREDERICK: You, cousin
38: Within these ten days if that thou be'st found
39: So near our public court as twenty miles,
40: Thou diest for it.
41: ROSALIND: I do beseech your grace,
42: Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:
43: If with myself I hold intelligence
44: Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
45: If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--
46: As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,
47: Never so much as in a thought unborn
48: Did I offend your highness.
49: DUKE FREDERICK: Thus do all traitors:
50: If their purgation did consist in words,
51: They are as innocent as grace itself:
52: Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
53: ROSALIND: Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
54: Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
55: DUKE FREDERICK: Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
56: ROSALIND: So was I when your highness took his dukedom;
57: So was I when your highness banish'd him:
58: Treason is not inherited, my lord;
59: Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
60: What's that to me? my father was no traitor:
61: Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
62: To think my poverty is treacherous.
63: CELIA: Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
64: DUKE FREDERICK: Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
65: Else had she with her father ranged along.
66: CELIA: I did not then entreat to have her stay;
67: It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
68: I was too young that time to value her;
69: But now I know her: if she be a traitor,
70: Why so am I; we still have slept together,
71: Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,
72: And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,
73: Still we went coupled and inseparable.
74: DUKE FREDERICK: She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
75: Her very silence and her patience
76: Speak to the people, and they pity her.
77: Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;
78: And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
79: When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:
80: Firm and irrevocable is my doom
81: Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.
82: CELIA: Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:
83: I cannot live out of her company.
84: DUKE FREDERICK: You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:
85: If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
86: And in the greatness of my word, you die.
87: CELIA: O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?
88: Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
89: I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.
90: ROSALIND: I have more cause.
91: CELIA: Thou hast not, cousin;
92: Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke
93: Hath banish'd me, his daughter?
94: ROSALIND: That he hath not.
95: CELIA: No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love
96: Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:
97: Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?
98: No: let my father seek another heir.
99: Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
100: Whither to go and what to bear with us;
101: And do not seek to take your change upon you,
102: To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;
103: For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
104: Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.
105: ROSALIND: Why, whither shall we go?
106: CELIA: To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.
107: ROSALIND: Alas, what danger will it be to us,
108: Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
109: Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
110: CELIA: I'll put myself in poor and mean attire
111: And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
112: The like do you: so shall we pass along
113: And never stir assailants.
114: ROSALIND: Were it not better,
115: Because that I am more than common tall,
116: That I did suit me all points like a man?
117: A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
118: A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart
119: Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--
120: We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
121: As many other mannish cowards have
122: That do outface it with their semblances.
123: CELIA: What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
124: ROSALIND: I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;
125: And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
126: But what will you be call'd?
127: CELIA: Something that hath a reference to my state
128: No longer Celia, but Aliena.
129: ROSALIND: But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
130: The clownish fool out of your father's court?
131: Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
ACT 2 SCENE 1

1: DUKE SENIOR: Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
2: Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
3: Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
4: More free from peril than the envious court?
5: Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
6: The seasons' difference, as the icy fang
7: And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
8: Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
9: Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
10: 'This is no flattery: these are counsellors
11: That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
12: Sweet are the uses of adversity,
13: Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
14: Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
15: And this our life exempt from public haunt
16: Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
17: Sermons in stones and good in every thing.
18: I would not change it.
19: AMIENS: Happy is your grace,
20: That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
21: Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
22: DUKE SENIOR: Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
23: And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
24: Being native burghers of this desert city,
25: Should in their own confines with forked heads
26: Have their round haunches gored.
27: First Lord: Indeed, my lord,
28: The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,
29: And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
30: Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
31: To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
32: Did steal behind him as he lay along
33: Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
34: Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:
35: To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,
36: That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,
37: Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,
38: The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
39: That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
40: Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
41: Coursed one another down his innocent nose
42: In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool
43: Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
44: Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,
45: Augmenting it with tears.
46: DUKE SENIOR: But what said Jaques?
47: Did he not moralize this spectacle?
48: First Lord: O, yes, into a thousand similes.
49: First, for his weeping into the needless stream;
50: 'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament
51: As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
52: To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,
53: Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,
54: ''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part
55: The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,
56: Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
57: And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,
58: 'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
59: 'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look
60: Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
61: Thus most invectively he pierceth through
62: The body of the country, city, court,
63: Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
64: Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,
65: To fright the animals and to kill them up
66: In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.
67: DUKE SENIOR: And did you leave him in this contemplation?
68: Second Lord: We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
69: Upon the sobbing deer.
70: DUKE SENIOR: Show me the place:
71: I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
72: For then he's full of matter.
73: First Lord: I'll bring you to him straight.
ACT 2 SCENE 2

1: DUKE FREDERICK: Can it be possible that no man saw them?
2: It cannot be: some villains of my court
3: Are of consent and sufferance in this.
4: First Lord: I cannot hear of any that did see her.
5: The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,
6: Saw her abed, and in the morning early
7: They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.
8: Second Lord: My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
9: Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
10: Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,
11: Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
12: Your daughter and her cousin much commend
13: The parts and graces of the wrestler
14: That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;
15: And she believes, wherever they are gone,
16: That youth is surely in their company.
17: DUKE FREDERICK: Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;
18: If he be absent, bring his brother to me;
19: I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,
20: And let not search and inquisition quail
21: To bring again these foolish runaways.
ACT 2 SCENE 3

1: ORLANDO: Who's there?
2: ADAM: What, my young master? O, my gentle master!
3: O my sweet master! O you memory
4: Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?
5: Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
6: And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?
7: Why would you be so fond to overcome
8: The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
9: Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
10: Know you not, master, to some kind of men
11: Their graces serve them but as enemies?
12: No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,
13: Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
14: O, what a world is this, when what is comely
15: Envenoms him that bears it!
16: ORLANDO: Why, what's the matter?
17: ADAM: O unhappy youth!
18: Come not within these doors; within this roof
19: The enemy of all your graces lives:
20: Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son--
21: Yet not the son, I will not call him son
22: Of him I was about to call his father--
23: Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
24: To burn the lodging where you use to lie
25: And you within it: if he fail of that,
26: He will have other means to cut you off.
27: I overheard him and his practises.
28: This is no place; this house is but a butchery:
29: Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
30: ORLANDO: Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
31: ADAM: No matter whither, so you come not here.
32: ORLANDO: What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?
33: Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
34: A thievish living on the common road?
35: This I must do, or know not what to do:
36: Yet this I will not do, do how I can;
37: I rather will subject me to the malice
38: Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
39: ADAM: But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
40: The thrifty hire I saved under your father,
41: Which I did store to be my foster-nurse
42: When service should in my old limbs lie lame
43: And unregarded age in corners thrown:
44: Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
45: Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
46: Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
47: And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:
48: Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
49: For in my youth I never did apply
50: Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
51: Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
52: The means of weakness and debility;
53: Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
54: Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;
55: I'll do the service of a younger man
56: In all your business and necessities.
57: ORLANDO: O good old man, how well in thee appears
58: The constant service of the antique world,
59: When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
60: Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
61: Where none will sweat but for promotion,
62: And having that, do choke their service up
63: Even with the having: it is not so with thee.
64: But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,
65: That cannot so much as a blossom yield
66: In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
67: But come thy ways; well go along together,
68: And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,
69: We'll light upon some settled low content.
70: ADAM: Master, go on, and I will follow thee,
71: To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
72: From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
73: Here lived I, but now live here no more.
74: At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;
75: But at fourscore it is too late a week:
76: Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
77: Than to die well and not my master's debtor.
ACT 2 SCENE 4

1: ROSALIND: O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!
2: TOUCHSTONE: I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.
3: ROSALIND: I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's
4: apparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort
5: the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show
6: itself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage,
7: good Aliena!
8: CELIA: I pray you, bear with me; I cannot go no further.
9: TOUCHSTONE: For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear
10: you; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,
11: for I think you have no money in your purse.
12: ROSALIND: Well, this is the forest of Arden.
13: TOUCHSTONE: Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was
14: at home, I was in a better place: but travellers
15: must be content.
16: ROSALIND: Ay, be so, good Touchstone.
17: Look you, who comes here; a young man and an old in
18: solemn talk.
19: CORIN: That is the way to make her scorn you still.
20: SILVIUS: O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!
21: CORIN: I partly guess; for I have loved ere now.
22: SILVIUS: No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
23: Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
24: As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow:
25: But if thy love were ever like to mine--
26: As sure I think did never man love so--
27: How many actions most ridiculous
28: Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
29: CORIN: Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
30: SILVIUS: O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!
31: If thou remember'st not the slightest folly
32: That ever love did make thee run into,
33: Thou hast not loved:
34: Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
35: Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,
36: Thou hast not loved:
37: Or if thou hast not broke from company
38: Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
39: Thou hast not loved.
40: O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!
41: ROSALIND: Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,
42: I have by hard adventure found mine own.
43: TOUCHSTONE: And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke
44: my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
45: coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the
46: kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her
47: pretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember the
48: wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took
49: two cods and, giving her them again, said with
50: weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are
51: true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is
52: mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.
53: ROSALIND: Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.
54: TOUCHSTONE: Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I
55: break my shins against it.
56: ROSALIND: Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion
57: Is much upon my fashion.
58: TOUCHSTONE: And mine; but it grows something stale with me.
59: CELIA: I pray you, one of you question yond man
60: If he for gold will give us any food:
61: I faint almost to death.
62: TOUCHSTONE: Holla, you clown!
63: ROSALIND: Peace, fool: he's not thy kinsman.
64: CORIN: Who calls?
65: TOUCHSTONE: Your betters, sir.
66: CORIN: Else are they very wretched.
67: ROSALIND: Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.
68: CORIN: And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.
69: ROSALIND: I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
70: Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
71: Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:
72: Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd
73: And faints for succor.
74: CORIN: Fair sir, I pity her
75: And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
76: My fortunes were more able to relieve her;
77: But I am shepherd to another man
78: And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:
79: My master is of churlish disposition
80: And little recks to find the way to heaven
81: By doing deeds of hospitality:
82: Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed
83: Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,
84: By reason of his absence, there is nothing
85: That you will feed on; but what is, come see.
86: And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
87: ROSALIND: What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
88: CORIN: That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
89: That little cares for buying any thing.
90: ROSALIND: I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
91: Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,
92: And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
93: CELIA: And we will mend thy wages. I like this place.
94: And willingly could waste my time in it.
95: CORIN: Assuredly the thing is to be sold:
96: Go with me: if you like upon report
97: The soil, the profit and this kind of life,
98: I will your very faithful feeder be
99: And buy it with your gold right suddenly.
ACT 2 SCENE 5

1: AMIENS: Under the greenwood tree
2: Who loves to lie with me,
3: And turn his merry note
4: Unto the sweet bird's throat,
5: Come hither, come hither, come hither:
6: Here shall he see No enemy
7: But winter and rough weather.
8: JAQUES: More, more, I prithee, more.
9: AMIENS: It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
10: JAQUES: I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck
11: melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs.
12: More, I prithee, more.
13: AMIENS: My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.
14: JAQUES: I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to
15: sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?
16: AMIENS: What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
17: JAQUES: Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me
18: nothing. Will you sing?
19: AMIENS: More at your request than to please myself.
20: JAQUES: Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you;
21: but that they call compliment is like the encounter
22: of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily,
23: methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me
24: the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will
25: not, hold your tongues.
26: AMIENS: Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the
27: duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all
28: this day to look you.
29: JAQUES: And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is
30: too disputable for my company: I think of as many
31: matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no
32: boast of them. Come, warble, come.
33: SONG.
34: Who doth ambition shun
35: And loves to live i' the sun,
36: Seeking the food he eats
37: And pleased with what he gets,
38: Come hither, come hither, come hither:
39: Here shall he see No enemy
40: But winter and rough weather.
41: I'll give you a verse to this note that I made
42: yesterday in despite of my invention.
43: AMIENS: And I'll sing it.
44: JAQUES: Thus it goes:--
45: If it do come to pass
46: That any man turn ass,
47: Leaving his wealth and ease,
48: A stubborn will to please,
49: Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame:
50: Here shall he see
51: Gross fools as he,
52: An if he will come to me.
53: AMIENS: What's that 'ducdame'?
54: JAQUES: 'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a
55: circle. I'll go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll
56: rail against all the first-born of Egypt.
57: AMIENS: And I'll go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.
ACT 2 SCENE 6

1: ADAM: Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food!
2: Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell,
3: kind master.
4: ORLANDO: Why, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live
5: a little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little.
6: If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, I
7: will either be food for it or bring it for food to
8: thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.
9: For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at
10: the arm's end: I will here be with thee presently;
11: and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will
12: give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I
13: come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!
14: thou lookest cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly.
15: Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bear
16: thee to some shelter; and thou shalt not die for
17: lack of a dinner, if there live any thing in this
18: desert. Cheerly, good Adam!
ACT 2 SCENE 7

1: DUKE SENIOR: I think he be transform'd into a beast;
2: For I can no where find him like a man.
3: First Lord: My lord, he is but even now gone hence:
4: Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
5: DUKE SENIOR: If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
6: We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
7: Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.
8: First Lord: He saves my labour by his own approach.
9: DUKE SENIOR: Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
10: That your poor friends must woo your company?
11: What, you look merrily!
12: JAQUES: A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,
13: A motley fool; a miserable world!
14: As I do live by food, I met a fool
15: Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
16: And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
17: In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
18: 'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,
19: 'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'
20: And then he drew a dial from his poke,
21: And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
22: Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:
23: Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:
24: 'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
25: And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
26: And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
27: And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
28: And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
29: The motley fool thus moral on the time,
30: My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
31: That fools should be so deep-contemplative,
32: And I did laugh sans intermission
33: An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
34: A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
35: DUKE SENIOR: What fool is this?
36: JAQUES: O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
37: And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
38: They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,
39: Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
40: After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
41: With observation, the which he vents
42: In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
43: I am ambitious for a motley coat.
44: DUKE SENIOR: Thou shalt have one.
45: JAQUES: It is my only suit;
46: Provided that you weed your better judgments
47: Of all opinion that grows rank in them
48: That I am wise. I must have liberty
49: Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
50: To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;
51: And they that are most galled with my folly,
52: They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
53: The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:
54: He that a fool doth very wisely hit
55: Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
56: Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,
57: The wise man's folly is anatomized
58: Even by the squandering glances of the fool.
59: Invest me in my motley; give me leave
60: To speak my mind, and I will through and through
61: Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,
62: If they will patiently receive my medicine.
63: DUKE SENIOR: Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
64: JAQUES: What, for a counter, would I do but good?
65: DUKE SENIOR: Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:
66: For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
67: As sensual as the brutish sting itself;
68: And all the embossed sores and headed evils,
69: That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,
70: Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
71: JAQUES: Why, who cries out on pride,
72: That can therein tax any private party?
73: Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
74: Till that the weary very means do ebb?
75: What woman in the city do I name,
76: When that I say the city-woman bears
77: The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
78: Who can come in and say that I mean her,
79: When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
80: Or what is he of basest function
81: That says his bravery is not of my cost,
82: Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
83: His folly to the mettle of my speech?
84: There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein
85: My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
86: Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,
87: Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,
88: Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?
89: ORLANDO: Forbear, and eat no more.
90: JAQUES: Why, I have eat none yet.
91: ORLANDO: Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.
92: JAQUES: Of what kind should this cock come of?
93: DUKE SENIOR: Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,
94: Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
95: That in civility thou seem'st so empty?
96: ORLANDO: You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
97: Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
98: Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred
99: And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:
100: He dies that touches any of this fruit
101: Till I and my affairs are answered.
102: JAQUES: An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.
103: DUKE SENIOR: What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
104: More than your force move us to gentleness.
105: ORLANDO: I almost die for food; and let me have it.
106: DUKE SENIOR: Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
107: ORLANDO: Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:
108: I thought that all things had been savage here;
109: And therefore put I on the countenance
110: Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
111: That in this desert inaccessible,
112: Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
113: Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
114: If ever you have look'd on better days,
115: If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
116: If ever sat at any good man's feast,
117: If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
118: And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
119: Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:
120: In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.
121: DUKE SENIOR: True is it that we have seen better days,
122: And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church
123: And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes
124: Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:
125: And therefore sit you down in gentleness
126: And take upon command what help we have
127: That to your wanting may be minister'd.
128: ORLANDO: Then but forbear your food a little while,
129: Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn
130: And give it food. There is an old poor man,
131: Who after me hath many a weary step
132: Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,
133: Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,
134: I will not touch a bit.
135: DUKE SENIOR: Go find him out,
136: And we will nothing waste till you return.
137: ORLANDO: I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
138: DUKE SENIOR: Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
139: This wide and universal theatre
140: Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
141: Wherein we play in.
142: JAQUES: All the world's a stage,
143: And all the men and women merely players:
144: They have their exits and their entrances;
145: And one man in his time plays many parts,
146: His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
147: Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
148: And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
149: And shining morning face, creeping like snail
150: Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
151: Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
152: Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
153: Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
154: Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
155: Seeking the bubble reputation
156: Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
157: In fair round belly with good capon lined,
158: With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
159: Full of wise saws and modern instances;
160: And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
161: Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
162: With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
163: His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
164: For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
165: Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
166: And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
167: That ends this strange eventful history,
168: Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
169: Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
170: DUKE SENIOR: Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,
171: And let him feed.
172: ORLANDO: I thank you most for him.
173: ADAM: So had you need:
174: I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
175: DUKE SENIOR: Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you
176: As yet, to question you about your fortunes.
177: Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
178: SONG.
179: AMIENS: Blow, blow, thou winter wind.
180: Thou art not so unkind
181: As man's ingratitude;
182: Thy tooth is not so keen,
183: Because thou art not seen,
184: Although thy breath be rude.
185: Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:
186: Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:
187: Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
188: This life is most jolly.
189: Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
190: That dost not bite so nigh
191: As benefits forgot:
192: Though thou the waters warp,
193: Thy sting is not so sharp
194: As friend remember'd not.
195: Heigh-ho! sing, & c.
ACT 3 SCENE 1

1: DUKE FREDERICK: Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:
2: But were I not the better part made mercy,
3: I should not seek an absent argument
4: Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:
5: Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is;
6: Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living
7: Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
8: To seek a living in our territory.
9: Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
10: Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,
11: Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth
12: Of what we think against thee.
13: OLIVER: O that your highness knew my heart in this!
14: I never loved my brother in my life.
15: DUKE FREDERICK: More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;
16: And let my officers of such a nature
17: Make an extent upon his house and lands:
18: Do this expediently and turn him going.
ACT 3 SCENE 2

1: ORLANDO: Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:
2: And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey
3: With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
4: Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
5: O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books
6: And in their barks my thoughts I'll character;
7: That every eye which in this forest looks
8: Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.
9: Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree
10: The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.
11: CORIN: And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?
12: TOUCHSTONE: Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
13: life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,
14: it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I
15: like it very well; but in respect that it is
16: private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it
17: is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in
18: respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As
19: is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;
20: but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much
21: against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?
22: CORIN: No more but that I know the more one sickens the
23: worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,
24: means and content is without three good friends;
25: that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
26: burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a
27: great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that
28: he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
29: complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.
30: TOUCHSTONE: Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
31: court, shepherd?
32: CORIN: No, truly.
33: TOUCHSTONE: Then thou art damned.
34: CORIN: Nay, I hope.
35: TOUCHSTONE: Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all
36: on one side.
37: CORIN: For not being at court? Your reason.
38: TOUCHSTONE: Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest
39: good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,
40: then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is
41: sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous
42: state, shepherd.
43: CORIN: Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners
44: at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
45: behavior of the country is most mockable at the
46: court. You told me you salute not at the court, but
47: you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be
48: uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.
49: TOUCHSTONE: Instance, briefly; come, instance.
50: CORIN: Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their
51: fells, you know, are greasy.
52: TOUCHSTONE: Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not
53: the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
54: a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.
55: CORIN: Besides, our hands are hard.
56: TOUCHSTONE: Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.
57: A more sounder instance, come.
58: CORIN: And they are often tarred over with the surgery of
59: our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The
60: courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.
61: TOUCHSTONE: Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a
62: good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and
63: perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the
64: very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.
65: CORIN: You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.
66: TOUCHSTONE: Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!
67: God make incision in thee! thou art raw.
68: CORIN: Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get
69: that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's
70: happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my
71: harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
72: graze and my lambs suck.
73: TOUCHSTONE: That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes
74: and the rams together and to offer to get your
75: living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a
76: bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a
77: twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
78: out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not
79: damned for this, the devil himself will have no
80: shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst
81: 'scape.
82: CORIN: Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.
83: ROSALIND: From the east to western Ind,
84: No jewel is like Rosalind.
85: Her worth, being mounted on the wind,
86: Through all the world bears Rosalind.
87: All the pictures fairest lined
88: Are but black to Rosalind.
89: Let no fair be kept in mind
90: But the fair of Rosalind.
91: TOUCHSTONE: I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and
92: suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the
93: right butter-women's rank to market.
94: ROSALIND: Out, fool!
95: TOUCHSTONE: For a taste:
96: If a hart do lack a hind,
97: Let him seek out Rosalind.
98: If the cat will after kind,
99: So be sure will Rosalind.
100: Winter garments must be lined,
101: So must slender Rosalind.
102: They that reap must sheaf and bind;
103: Then to cart with Rosalind.
104: Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,
105: Such a nut is Rosalind.
106: He that sweetest rose will find
107: Must find love's prick and Rosalind.
108: This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you
109: infect yourself with them?
110: ROSALIND: Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.
111: TOUCHSTONE: Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
112: ROSALIND: I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it
113: with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit
114: i' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half
115: ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.
116: TOUCHSTONE: You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the
117: forest judge.
118: ROSALIND: Peace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.
119: CELIA: [Reads]
120: Why should this a desert be?
121: For it is unpeopled? No:
122: Tongues I'll hang on every tree,
123: That shall civil sayings show:
124: Some, how brief the life of man
125: Runs his erring pilgrimage,
126: That the stretching of a span
127: Buckles in his sum of age;
128: Some, of violated vows
129: 'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:
130: But upon the fairest boughs,
131: Or at every sentence end,
132: Will I Rosalinda write,
133: Teaching all that read to know
134: The quintessence of every sprite
135: Heaven would in little show.
136: Therefore Heaven Nature charged
137: That one body should be fill'd
138: With all graces wide-enlarged:
139: Nature presently distill'd
140: Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
141: Cleopatra's majesty,
142: Atalanta's better part,
143: Sad Lucretia's modesty.
144: Thus Rosalind of many parts
145: By heavenly synod was devised,
146: Of many faces, eyes and hearts,
147: To have the touches dearest prized.
148: Heaven would that she these gifts should have,
149: And I to live and die her slave.
150: ROSALIND: O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love
151: have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never
152: cried 'Have patience, good people!'
153: CELIA: How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little.
154: Go with him, sirrah.
155: TOUCHSTONE: Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;
156: though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.
157: CELIA: Didst thou hear these verses?
158: ROSALIND: O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of
159: them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
160: CELIA: That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.
161: ROSALIND: Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear
162: themselves without the verse and therefore stood
163: lamely in the verse.
164: CELIA: But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
165: should be hanged and carved upon these trees?
166: ROSALIND: I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
167: before you came; for look here what I found on a
168: palm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since
169: Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I
170: can hardly remember.
171: CELIA: Trow you who hath done this?
172: ROSALIND: Is it a man?
173: CELIA: And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
174: Change you colour?
175: ROSALIND: I prithee, who?
176: CELIA: O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to
177: meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
178: and so encounter.
179: ROSALIND: Nay, but who is it?
180: CELIA: Is it possible?
181: ROSALIND: Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,
182: tell me who it is.
183: CELIA: O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful
184: wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,
185: out of all hooping!
186: ROSALIND: Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
187: caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in
188: my disposition? One inch of delay more is a
189: South-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it
190: quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst
191: stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man
192: out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-
193: mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at
194: all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that
195: may drink thy tidings.
196: CELIA: So you may put a man in your belly.
197: ROSALIND: Is he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his
198: head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?
199: CELIA: Nay, he hath but a little beard.
200: ROSALIND: Why, God will send more, if the man will be
201: thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if
202: thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.
203: CELIA: It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler's
204: heels and your heart both in an instant.
205: ROSALIND: Nay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and
206: true maid.
207: CELIA: I' faith, coz, 'tis he.
208: ROSALIND: Orlando?
209: CELIA: Orlando.
210: ROSALIND: Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and
211: hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said
212: he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes
213: him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?
214: How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see
215: him again? Answer me in one word.
216: CELIA: You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a
217: word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To
218: say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
219: answer in a catechism.
220: ROSALIND: But doth he know that I am in this forest and in
221: man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the
222: day he wrestled?
223: CELIA: It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
224: propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my
225: finding him, and relish it with good observance.
226: I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.
227: ROSALIND: It may well be called Jove's tree, when it drops
228: forth such fruit.
229: CELIA: Give me audience, good madam.
230: ROSALIND: Proceed.
231: CELIA: There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight.
232: ROSALIND: Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well
233: becomes the ground.
234: CELIA: Cry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets
235: unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.
236: ROSALIND: O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.
237: CELIA: I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest
238: me out of tune.
239: ROSALIND: Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must
240: speak. Sweet, say on.
241: CELIA: You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?
242: ROSALIND: 'Tis he: slink by, and note him.
243: JAQUES: I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had
244: as lief have been myself alone.
245: ORLANDO: And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you
246: too for your society.
247: JAQUES: God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.
248: ORLANDO: I do desire we may be better strangers.
249: JAQUES: I pray you, mar no more trees with writing
250: love-songs in their barks.
251: ORLANDO: I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading
252: them ill-favouredly.
253: JAQUES: Rosalind is your love's name?
254: ORLANDO: Yes, just.
255: JAQUES: I do not like her name.
256: ORLANDO: There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
257: christened.
258: JAQUES: What stature is she of?
259: ORLANDO: Just as high as my heart.
260: JAQUES: You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
261: acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them
262: out of rings?
263: ORLANDO: Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from
264: whence you have studied your questions.
265: JAQUES: You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of
266: Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and
267: we two will rail against our mistress the world and
268: all our misery.
269: ORLANDO: I will chide no breather in the world but myself,
270: against whom I know most faults.
271: JAQUES: The worst fault you have is to be in love.
272: ORLANDO: 'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.
273: I am weary of you.
274: JAQUES: By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found
275: you.
276: ORLANDO: He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you
277: shall see him.
278: JAQUES: There I shall see mine own figure.
279: ORLANDO: Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
280: JAQUES: I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good
281: Signior Love.
282: ORLANDO: I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur
283: Melancholy.
284: ROSALIND: [Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him, like a saucy
285: lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.
286: Do you hear, forester?
287: ORLANDO: Very well: what would you?
288: ROSALIND: I pray you, what is't o'clock?
289: ORLANDO: You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock
290: in the forest.
291: ROSALIND: Then there is no true lover in the forest; else
292: sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
293: detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.
294: ORLANDO: And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
295: been as proper?
296: ROSALIND: By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with
297: divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles
298: withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops
299: withal and who he stands still withal.
300: ORLANDO: I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
301: ROSALIND: Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
302: contract of her marriage and the day it is
303: solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,
304: Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of
305: seven year.
306: ORLANDO: Who ambles Time withal?
307: ROSALIND: With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
308: hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because
309: he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because
310: he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean
311: and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden
312: of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.
313: ORLANDO: Who doth he gallop withal?
314: ROSALIND: With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as
315: softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.
316: ORLANDO: Who stays it still withal?
317: ROSALIND: With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between
318: term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.
319: ORLANDO: Where dwell you, pretty youth?
320: ROSALIND: With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the
321: skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.
322: ORLANDO: Are you native of this place?
323: ROSALIND: As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.
324: ORLANDO: Your accent is something finer than you could
325: purchase in so removed a dwelling.
326: ROSALIND: I have been told so of many: but indeed an old
327: religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was
328: in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship
329: too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard
330: him read many lectures against it, and I thank God
331: I am not a woman, to be touched with so many
332: giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
333: whole sex withal.
334: ORLANDO: Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
335: laid to the charge of women?
336: ROSALIND: There were none principal; they were all like one
337: another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming
338: monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.
339: ORLANDO: I prithee, recount some of them.
340: ROSALIND: No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that
341: are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that
342: abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on
343: their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
344: on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of
345: Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would
346: give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the
347: quotidian of love upon him.
348: ORLANDO: I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me
349: your remedy.
350: ROSALIND: There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he
351: taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage
352: of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
353: ORLANDO: What were his marks?
354: ROSALIND: A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and
355: sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable
356: spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,
357: which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for
358: simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
359: revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your
360: bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe
361: untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
362: careless desolation; but you are no such man; you
363: are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
364: loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
365: ORLANDO: Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
366: ROSALIND: Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you
367: love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to
368: do than to confess she does: that is one of the
369: points in the which women still give the lie to
370: their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he
371: that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind
372: is so admired?
373: ORLANDO: I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of
374: Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.
375: ROSALIND: But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
376: ORLANDO: Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
377: ROSALIND: Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves
378: as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and
379: the reason why they are not so punished and cured
380: is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
381: are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.
382: ORLANDO: Did you ever cure any so?
383: ROSALIND: Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me
384: his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to
385: woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish
386: youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing
387: and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,
388: inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every
389: passion something and for no passion truly any
390: thing, as boys and women are for the most part
391: cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe
392: him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep
393: for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor
394: from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
395: madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of
396: the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.
397: And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon
398: me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
399: heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.
400: ORLANDO: I would not be cured, youth.
401: ROSALIND: I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind
402: and come every day to my cote and woo me.
403: ORLANDO: Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me
404: where it is.
405: ROSALIND: Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way
406: you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
407: Will you go?
408: ORLANDO: With all my heart, good youth.
409: ROSALIND: Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?
ACT 3 SCENE 3

1: TOUCHSTONE: Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your
2: goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?
3: doth my simple feature content you?
4: AUDREY: Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!
5: TOUCHSTONE: I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
6: capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
7: JAQUES: [Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove
8: in a thatched house!
9: TOUCHSTONE: When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a
10: man's good wit seconded with the forward child
11: Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a
12: great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would
13: the gods had made thee poetical.
14: AUDREY: I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in
15: deed and word? is it a true thing?
16: TOUCHSTONE: No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most
17: feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what
18: they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.
19: AUDREY: Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?
20: TOUCHSTONE: I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art
21: honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some
22: hope thou didst feign.
23: AUDREY: Would you not have me honest?
24: TOUCHSTONE: No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for
25: honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
26: JAQUES: [Aside] A material fool!
27: AUDREY: Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods
28: make me honest.
29: TOUCHSTONE: Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
30: were to put good meat into an unclean dish.
31: AUDREY: I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
32: TOUCHSTONE: Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!
33: sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
34: be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been
35: with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next
36: village, who hath promised to meet me in this place
37: of the forest and to couple us.
38: JAQUES: [Aside] I would fain see this meeting.
39: AUDREY: Well, the gods give us joy!
40: TOUCHSTONE: Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,
41: stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple
42: but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what
43: though? C ourage! As horns are odious, they are
44: necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of
45: his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and
46: knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of
47: his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?
48: Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer
49: hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man
50: therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more
51: worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a
52: married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
53: bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
54: skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to
55: want. Here comes Sir Oliver.
56: Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you
57: dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go
58: with you to your chapel?
59: SIR OLIVER MARTEXT: Is there none here to give the woman?
60: TOUCHSTONE: I will not take her on gift of any man.
61: SIR OLIVER MARTEXT: Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
62: JAQUES: [Advancing]
63: Proceed, proceed I'll give her.
64: TOUCHSTONE: Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,
65: sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your
66: last company: I am very glad to see you: even a
67: toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.
68: JAQUES: Will you be married, motley?
69: TOUCHSTONE: As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and
70: the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and
71: as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
72: JAQUES: And will you, being a man of your breeding, be
73: married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to
74: church, and have a good priest that can tell you
75: what marriage is: this fellow will but join you
76: together as they join wainscot; then one of you will
77: prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.
78: TOUCHSTONE: [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be
79: married of him than of another: for he is not like
80: to marry me well; and not being well married, it
81: will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.
82: JAQUES: Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
83: TOUCHSTONE: 'Come, sweet Audrey:
84: We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.
85: Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,--
86: O sweet Oliver,
87: O brave Oliver,
88: Leave me not behind thee: but,--
89: Wind away,
90: Begone, I say,
91: I will not to wedding with thee.
92: SIR OLIVER MARTEXT: 'Tis no matter: ne'er a fantastical knave of them
93: all shall flout me out of my calling.
ACT 3 SCENE 4

1: ROSALIND: Never talk to me; I will weep.
2: CELIA: Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider
3: that tears do not become a man.
4: ROSALIND: But have I not cause to weep?
5: CELIA: As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
6: ROSALIND: His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
7: CELIA: Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are
8: Judas's own children.
9: ROSALIND: I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
10: CELIA: An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
11: ROSALIND: And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
12: of holy bread.
13: CELIA: He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun
14: of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;
15: the very ice of chastity is in them.
16: ROSALIND: But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
17: comes not?
18: CELIA: Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
19: ROSALIND: Do you think so?
20: CELIA: Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a
21: horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do
22: think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
23: worm-eaten nut.
24: ROSALIND: Not true in love?
25: CELIA: Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
26: ROSALIND: You have heard him swear downright he was.
27: CELIA: 'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is
28: no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are
29: both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
30: here in the forest on the duke your father.
31: ROSALIND: I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
32: him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told
33: him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.
34: But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a
35: man as Orlando?
36: CELIA: O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,
37: speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks
38: them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of
39: his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse
40: but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
41: goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly
42: guides. Who comes here?
43: CORIN: Mistress and master, you have oft inquired
44: After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
45: Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
46: Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
47: That was his mistress.
48: CELIA: Well, and what of him?
49: CORIN: If you will see a pageant truly play'd,
50: Between the pale complexion of true love
51: And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
52: Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,
53: If you will mark it.
54: ROSALIND: O, come, let us remove:
55: The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
56: Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
57: I'll prove a busy actor in their play.
ACT 3 SCENE 5

1: SILVIUS: Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;
2: Say that you love me not, but say not so
3: In bitterness. The common executioner,
4: Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,
5: Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
6: But first begs pardon: will you sterner be
7: Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
8: PHEBE: I would not be thy executioner:
9: I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
10: Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:
11: 'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
12: That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
13: Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
14: Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!
15: Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
16: And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:
17: Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;
18: Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
19: Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!
20: Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:
21: Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
22: Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,
23: The cicatrice and capable impressure
24: Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,
25: Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,
26: Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes
27: That can do hurt.
28: SILVIUS: O dear Phebe,
29: If ever,--as that ever may be near,--
30: You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
31: Then shall you know the wounds invisible
32: That love's keen arrows make.
33: PHEBE: But till that time
34: Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,
35: Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
36: As till that time I shall not pity thee.
37: ROSALIND: And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,
38: That you insult, exult, and all at once,
39: Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--
40: As, by my faith, I see no more in you
41: Than without candle may go dark to bed--
42: Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
43: Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
44: I see no more in you than in the ordinary
45: Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,
46: I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
47: No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:
48: 'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
49: Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
50: That can entame my spirits to your worship.
51: You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
52: Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
53: You are a thousand times a properer man
54: Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you
55: That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:
56: 'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
57: And out of you she sees herself more proper
58: Than any of her lineaments can show her.
59: But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,
60: And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:
61: For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
62: Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:
63: Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:
64: Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
65: So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.
66: PHEBE: Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:
67: I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
68: ROSALIND: He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll
69: fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as
70: she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her
71: with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?
72: PHEBE: For no ill will I bear you.
73: ROSALIND: I pray you, do not fall in love with me,
74: For I am falser than vows made in wine:
75: Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
76: 'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
77: Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
78: Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
79: And be not proud: though all the world could see,
80: None could be so abused in sight as he.
81: Come, to our flock.
82: PHEBE: Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,
83: 'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'
84: SILVIUS: Sweet Phebe,--
85: PHEBE: Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?
86: SILVIUS: Sweet Phebe, pity me.
87: PHEBE: Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
88: SILVIUS: Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:
89: If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
90: By giving love your sorrow and my grief
91: Were both extermined.
92: PHEBE: Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?
93: SILVIUS: I would have you.
94: PHEBE: Why, that were covetousness.
95: Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,
96: And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
97: But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
98: Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
99: I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:
100: But do not look for further recompense
101: Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.
102: SILVIUS: So holy and so perfect is my love,
103: And I in such a poverty of grace,
104: That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
105: To glean the broken ears after the man
106: That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then
107: A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.
108: PHEBE: Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
109: SILVIUS: Not very well, but I have met him oft;
110: And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
111: That the old carlot once was master of.
112: PHEBE: Think not I love him, though I ask for him:
113: 'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;
114: But what care I for words? yet words do well
115: When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
116: It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:
117: But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:
118: He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
119: Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
120: Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
121: He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:
122: His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:
123: There was a pretty redness in his lip,
124: A little riper and more lusty red
125: Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
126: Between the constant red and mingled damask.
127: There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
128: In parcels as I did, would have gone near
129: To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
130: I love him not nor hate him not; and yet
131: I have more cause to hate him than to love him:
132: For what had he to do to chide at me?
133: He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:
134: And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:
135: I marvel why I answer'd not again:
136: But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.
137: I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
138: And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?
139: SILVIUS: Phebe, with all my heart.
ACT 4 SCENE 1

1: JAQUES: I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted
2: with thee.
3: ROSALIND: They say you are a melancholy fellow.
4: JAQUES: I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
5: ROSALIND: Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
6: fellows and betray themselves to every modern
7: censure worse than drunkards.
8: JAQUES: Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
9: ROSALIND: Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
10: JAQUES: I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
11: emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,
12: nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the
13: soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,
14: which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor
15: the lover's, which is all these: but it is a
16: melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,
17: extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's
18: contemplation of my travels, in which my often
19: rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.
20: ROSALIND: A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to
21: be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see
22: other men's; then, to have seen much and to have
23: nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
24: JAQUES: Yes, I have gained my experience.
25: ROSALIND: And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have
26: a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
27: sad; and to travel for it too!
28: ORLANDO: Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!
29: JAQUES: Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.
30: ROSALIND: Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and
31: wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your
32: own country, be out of love with your nativity and
33: almost chide God for making you that countenance you
34: are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a
35: gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been
36: all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such
37: another trick, never come in my sight more.
38: ORLANDO: My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
39: ROSALIND: Break an hour's promise in love! He that will
40: divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
41: a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
42: affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid
43: hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant
44: him heart-whole.
45: ORLANDO: Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
46: ROSALIND: Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I
47: had as lief be wooed of a snail.
48: ORLANDO: Of a snail?
49: ROSALIND: Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he
50: carries his house on his head; a better jointure,
51: I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings
52: his destiny with him.
53: ORLANDO: What's that?
54: ROSALIND: Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be
55: beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in
56: his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.
57: ORLANDO: Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
58: ROSALIND: And I am your Rosalind.
59: CELIA: It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a
60: Rosalind of a better leer than you.
61: ROSALIND: Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday
62: humour and like enough to consent. What would you
63: say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?
64: ORLANDO: I would kiss before I spoke.
65: ROSALIND: Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were
66: gravelled for lack of matter, you might take
67: occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are
68: out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God
69: warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.
70: ORLANDO: How if the kiss be denied?
71: ROSALIND: Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.
72: ORLANDO: Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
73: ROSALIND: Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or
74: I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
75: ORLANDO: What, of my suit?
76: ROSALIND: Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
77: Am not I your Rosalind?
78: ORLANDO: I take some joy to say you are, because I would be
79: talking of her.
80: ROSALIND: Well in her person I say I will not have you.
81: ORLANDO: Then in mine own person I die.
82: ROSALIND: No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is
83: almost six thousand years old, and in all this time
84: there was not any man died in his own person,
85: videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains
86: dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
87: could to die before, and he is one of the patterns
88: of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair
89: year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been
90: for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went
91: but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
92: taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
93: coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'
94: But these are all lies: men have died from time to
95: time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.
96: ORLANDO: I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,
97: for, I protest, her frown might kill me.
98: ROSALIND: By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now
99: I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on
100: disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant
101: it.
102: ORLANDO: Then love me, Rosalind.
103: ROSALIND: Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.
104: ORLANDO: And wilt thou have me?
105: ROSALIND: Ay, and twenty such.
106: ORLANDO: What sayest thou?
107: ROSALIND: Are you not good?
108: ORLANDO: I hope so.
109: ROSALIND: Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?
110: Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.
111: Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?
112: ORLANDO: Pray thee, marry us.
113: CELIA: I cannot say the words.
114: ROSALIND: You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'
115: CELIA: Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
116: ORLANDO: I will.
117: ROSALIND: Ay, but when?
118: ORLANDO: Why now; as fast as she can marry us.
119: ROSALIND: Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
120: ORLANDO: I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
121: ROSALIND: I might ask you for your commission; but I do take
122: thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes
123: before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought
124: runs before her actions.
125: ORLANDO: So do all thoughts; they are winged.
126: ROSALIND: Now tell me how long you would have her after you
127: have possessed her.
128: ORLANDO: For ever and a day.
129: ROSALIND: Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;
130: men are April when they woo, December when they wed:
131: maids are May when they are maids, but the sky
132: changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous
133: of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
134: more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more
135: new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires
136: than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana
137: in the fountain, and I will do that when you are
138: disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and
139: that when thou art inclined to sleep.
140: ORLANDO: But will my Rosalind do so?
141: ROSALIND: By my life, she will do as I do.
142: ORLANDO: O, but she is wise.
143: ROSALIND: Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the
144: wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's
145: wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and
146: 'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly
147: with the smoke out at the chimney.
148: ORLANDO: A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say
149: 'Wit, whither wilt?'
150: ROSALIND: Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met
151: your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.
152: ORLANDO: And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
153: ROSALIND: Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall
154: never take her without her answer, unless you take
155: her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot
156: make her fault her husband's occasion, let her
157: never nurse her child herself, for she will breed
158: it like a fool!
159: ORLANDO: For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
160: ROSALIND: Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.
161: ORLANDO: I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I
162: will be with thee again.
163: ROSALIND: Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you
164: would prove: my friends told me as much, and I
165: thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours
166: won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,
167: death! Two o'clock is your hour?
168: ORLANDO: Ay, sweet Rosalind.
169: ROSALIND: By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend
170: me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,
171: if you break one jot of your promise or come one
172: minute behind your hour, I will think you the most
173: pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover
174: and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that
175: may be chosen out of the gross band of the
176: unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep
177: your promise.
178: ORLANDO: With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
179: Rosalind: so adieu.
180: ROSALIND: Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
181: offenders, and let Time try: adieu.
182: CELIA: You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:
183: we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
184: head, and show the world what the bird hath done to
185: her own nest.
186: ROSALIND: O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou
187: didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But
188: it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown
189: bottom, like the bay of Portugal.
190: CELIA: Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour
191: affection in, it runs out.
192: ROSALIND: No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot
193: of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,
194: that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes
195: because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I
196: am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out
197: of the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and
198: sigh till he come.
199: CELIA: And I'll sleep.
ACT 4 SCENE 2

1: JAQUES: Which is he that killed the deer?
2: A Lord: Sir, it was I.
3: JAQUES: Let's present him to the duke, like a Roman
4: conqueror; and it would do well to set the deer's
5: horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have
6: you no song, forester, for this purpose?
7: Forester: Yes, sir.
8: JAQUES: Sing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it
9: make noise enough.
10: SONG.
11: Forester: What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
12: His leather skin and horns to wear.
13: Then sing him home;
14: Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;
15: It was a crest ere thou wast born:
16: Thy father's father wore it,
17: And thy father bore it:
18: The horn, the horn, the lusty horn
19: Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.
ACT 4 SCENE 3

1: ROSALIND: How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? and
2: here much Orlando!
3: CELIA: I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he
4: hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to
5: sleep. Look, who comes here.
6: SILVIUS: My errand is to you, fair youth;
7: My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:
8: I know not the contents; but, as I guess
9: By the stern brow and waspish action
10: Which she did use as she was writing of it,
11: It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:
12: I am but as a guiltless messenger.
13: ROSALIND: Patience herself would startle at this letter
14: And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:
15: She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
16: She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
17: Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!
18: Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:
19: Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
20: This is a letter of your own device.
21: SILVIUS: No, I protest, I know not the contents:
22: Phebe did write it.
23: ROSALIND: Come, come, you are a fool
24: And turn'd into the extremity of love.
25: I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.
26: A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
27: That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:
28: She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:
29: I say she never did invent this letter;
30: This is a man's invention and his hand.
31: SILVIUS: Sure, it is hers.
32: ROSALIND: Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.
33: A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,
34: Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain
35: Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention
36: Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
37: Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
38: SILVIUS: So please you, for I never heard it yet;
39: Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.
40: ROSALIND: She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
41: Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
42: That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?
43: Can a woman rail thus?
44: SILVIUS: Call you this railing?
45: ROSALIND: [Reads]
46: Why, thy godhead laid apart,
47: Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?
48: Did you ever hear such railing?
49: Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
50: That could do no vengeance to me.
51: Meaning me a beast.
52: If the scorn of your bright eyne
53: Have power to raise such love in mine,
54: Alack, in me what strange effect
55: Would they work in mild aspect!
56: Whiles you chid me, I did love;
57: How then might your prayers move!
58: He that brings this love to thee
59: Little knows this love in me:
60: And by him seal up thy mind;
61: Whether that thy youth and kind
62: Will the faithful offer take
63: Of me and all that I can make;
64: Or else by him my love deny,
65: And then I'll study how to die.
66: SILVIUS: Call you this chiding?
67: CELIA: Alas, poor shepherd!
68: ROSALIND: Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt
69: thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an
70: instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to
71: be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see
72: love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to
73: her: that if she love me, I charge her to love
74: thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless
75: thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,
76: hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.
77: OLIVER: Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,
78: Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
79: A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?
80: CELIA: West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:
81: The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
82: Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
83: But at this hour the house doth keep itself;
84: There's none within.
85: OLIVER: If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
86: Then should I know you by description;
87: Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,
88: Of female favour, and bestows himself
89: Like a ripe sister: the woman low
90: And browner than her brother.' Are not you
91: The owner of the house I did inquire for?
92: CELIA: It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
93: OLIVER: Orlando doth commend him to you both,
94: And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
95: He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
96: ROSALIND: I am: what must we understand by this?
97: OLIVER: Some of my shame; if you will know of me
98: What man I am, and how, and why, and where
99: This handkercher was stain'd.
100: CELIA: I pray you, tell it.
101: OLIVER: When last the young Orlando parted from you
102: He left a promise to return again
103: Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,
104: Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
105: Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,
106: And mark what object did present itself:
107: Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age
108: And high top bald with dry antiquity,
109: A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
110: Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck
111: A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,
112: Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
113: The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
114: Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,
115: And with indented glides did slip away
116: Into a bush: under which bush's shade
117: A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
118: Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
119: When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
120: The royal disposition of that beast
121: To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:
122: This seen, Orlando did approach the man
123: And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
124: CELIA: O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
125: And he did render him the most unnatural
126: That lived amongst men.
127: OLIVER: And well he might so do,
128: For well I know he was unnatural.
129: ROSALIND: But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
130: Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?
131: OLIVER: Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;
132: But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
133: And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
134: Made him give battle to the lioness,
135: Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling
136: From miserable slumber I awaked.
137: CELIA: Are you his brother?
138: ROSALIND: Wast you he rescued?
139: CELIA: Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
140: OLIVER: 'Twas I; but 'tis not I I do not shame
141: To tell you what I was, since my conversion
142: So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
143: ROSALIND: But, for the bloody napkin?
144: OLIVER: By and by.
145: When from the first to last betwixt us two
146: Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,
147: As how I came into that desert place:--
148: In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,
149: Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
150: Committing me unto my brother's love;
151: Who led me instantly unto his cave,
152: There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
153: The lioness had torn some flesh away,
154: Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted
155: And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
156: Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;
157: And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
158: He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
159: To tell this story, that you might excuse
160: His broken promise, and to give this napkin
161: Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
162: That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
163: CELIA: Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
164: OLIVER: Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
165: CELIA: There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
166: OLIVER: Look, he recovers.
167: ROSALIND: I would I were at home.
168: CELIA: We'll lead you thither.
169: I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
170: OLIVER: Be of good cheer, youth: you a man! you lack a
171: man's heart.
172: ROSALIND: I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would
173: think this was well counterfeited! I pray you, tell
174: your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!
175: OLIVER: This was not counterfeit: there is too great
176: testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
177: of earnest.
178: ROSALIND: Counterfeit, I assure you.
179: OLIVER: Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
180: ROSALIND: So I do: but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.
181: CELIA: Come, you look paler and paler: pray you, draw
182: homewards. Good sir, go with us.
183: OLIVER: That will I, for I must bear answer back
184: How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.
ACT 5 SCENE 1

1: TOUCHSTONE: We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.
2: AUDREY: Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old
3: gentleman's saying.
4: TOUCHSTONE: A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile
5: Martext. But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the
6: forest lays claim to you.
7: AUDREY: Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in
8: the world: here comes the man you mean.
9: TOUCHSTONE: It is meat and drink to me to see a clown: by my
10: troth, we that have good wits have much to answer
11: for; we shall be flouting; we cannot hold.
12: WILLIAM: Good even, Audrey.
13: AUDREY: God ye good even, William.
14: WILLIAM: And good even to you, sir.
15: TOUCHSTONE: Good even, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy
16: head; nay, prithee, be covered. How old are you, friend?
17: WILLIAM: Five and twenty, sir.
18: TOUCHSTONE: A ripe age. Is thy name William?
19: WILLIAM: William, sir.
20: TOUCHSTONE: A fair name. Wast born i' the forest here?
21: WILLIAM: Ay, sir, I thank God.
22: TOUCHSTONE: 'Thank God;' a good answer. Art rich?
23: WILLIAM: Faith, sir, so so.
24: TOUCHSTONE: 'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and
25: yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?
26: WILLIAM: Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
27: TOUCHSTONE: Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,
28: 'The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man
29: knows himself to be a fool.' The heathen
30: philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,
31: would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;
32: meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and
33: lips to open. You do love this maid?
34: WILLIAM: I do, sir.
35: TOUCHSTONE: Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
36: WILLIAM: No, sir.
37: TOUCHSTONE: Then learn this of me: to have, is to have; for it
38: is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out
39: of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty
40: the other; for all your writers do consent that ipse
41: is he: now, you are not ipse, for I am he.
42: WILLIAM: Which he, sir?
43: TOUCHSTONE: He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you
44: clown, abandon,--which is in the vulgar leave,--the
45: society,--which in the boorish is company,--of this
46: female,--which in the common is woman; which
47: together is, abandon the society of this female, or,
48: clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better
49: understanding, diest; or, to wit I kill thee, make
50: thee away, translate thy life into death, thy
51: liberty into bondage: I will deal in poison with
52: thee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy
53: with thee in faction; I will o'errun thee with
54: policy; I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways:
55: therefore tremble and depart.
56: AUDREY: Do, good William.
57: WILLIAM: God rest you merry, sir.
58: CORIN: Our master and mistress seeks you; come, away, away!
59: TOUCHSTONE: Trip, Audrey! trip, Audrey! I attend, I attend.
ACT 5 SCENE 2

1: ORLANDO: Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you
2: should like her? that but seeing you should love
3: her? and loving woo? and, wooing, she should
4: grant? and will you persever to enjoy her?
5: OLIVER: Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the
6: poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden
7: wooing, nor her sudden consenting; but say with me,
8: I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me;
9: consent with both that we may enjoy each other: it
10: shall be to your good; for my father's house and all
11: the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I
12: estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.
13: ORLANDO: You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow:
14: thither will I invite the duke and all's contented
15: followers. Go you and prepare Aliena; for look
16: you, here comes my Rosalind.
17: ROSALIND: God save you, brother.
18: OLIVER: And you, fair sister.
19: ROSALIND: O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee
20: wear thy heart in a scarf!
21: ORLANDO: It is my arm.
22: ROSALIND: I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws
23: of a lion.
24: ORLANDO: Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
25: ROSALIND: Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to
26: swoon when he showed me your handkerchief?
27: ORLANDO: Ay, and greater wonders than that.
28: ROSALIND: O, I know where you are: nay, 'tis true: there was
29: never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams
30: and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and
31: overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner
32: met but they looked, no sooner looked but they
33: loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no sooner
34: sighed but they asked one another the reason, no
35: sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;
36: and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs
37: to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or
38: else be incontinent before marriage: they are in
39: the very wrath of love and they will together; clubs
40: cannot part them.
41: ORLANDO: They shall be married to-morrow, and I will bid the
42: duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it
43: is to look into happiness through another man's
44: eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at
45: the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall
46: think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.
47: ROSALIND: Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?
48: ORLANDO: I can live no longer by thinking.
49: ROSALIND: I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.
50: Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,
51: that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I
52: speak not this that you should bear a good opinion
53: of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;
54: neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in
55: some little measure draw a belief from you, to do
56: yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if
57: you please, that I can do strange things: I have,
58: since I was three year old, conversed with a
59: magician, most profound in his art and yet not
60: damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart
61: as your gesture cries it out, when your brother
62: marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into
63: what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is
64: not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient
65: to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human
66: as she is and without any danger.
67: ORLANDO: Speakest thou in sober meanings?
68: ROSALIND: By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I
69: say I am a magician. Therefore, put you in your
70: best array: bid your friends; for if you will be
71: married to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.
72: Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.
73: PHEBE: Youth, you have done me much ungentleness,
74: To show the letter that I writ to you.
75: ROSALIND: I care not if I have: it is my study
76: To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:
77: You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;
78: Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
79: PHEBE: Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
80: SILVIUS: It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
81: And so am I for Phebe.
82: PHEBE: And I for Ganymede.
83: ORLANDO: And I for Rosalind.
84: ROSALIND: And I for no woman.
85: SILVIUS: It is to be all made of faith and service;
86: And so am I for Phebe.
87: PHEBE: And I for Ganymede.
88: ORLANDO: And I for Rosalind.
89: ROSALIND: And I for no woman.
90: SILVIUS: It is to be all made of fantasy,
91: All made of passion and all made of wishes,
92: All adoration, duty, and observance,
93: All humbleness, all patience and impatience,
94: All purity, all trial, all observance;
95: And so am I for Phebe.
96: PHEBE: And so am I for Ganymede.
97: ORLANDO: And so am I for Rosalind.
98: ROSALIND: And so am I for no woman.
99: PHEBE: If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
100: SILVIUS: If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
101: ORLANDO: If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
102: ROSALIND: Who do you speak to, 'Why blame you me to love you?'
103: ORLANDO: To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
104: ROSALIND: Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling
105: of Irish wolves against the moon.
106: I will help you, if I can:
107: I would love you, if I could. To-morrow meet me all together.
108: I will marry you, if ever I marry woman, and I'll be
109: married to-morrow:
110: I will satisfy you, if ever I satisfied man, and you
111: shall be married to-morrow:
112: I will content you, if what pleases you contents
113: you, and you shall be married to-morrow.
114: As you love Rosalind, meet:
115: as you love Phebe, meet: and as I love no woman,
116: I'll meet. So fare you well: I have left you commands.
117: SILVIUS: I'll not fail, if I live.
118: PHEBE: Nor I.
119: ORLANDO: Nor I.
ACT 5 SCENE 3

1: TOUCHSTONE: To-morrow is the joyful day, Audrey; to-morrow will
2: we be married.
3: AUDREY: I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is
4: no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the
5: world. Here comes two of the banished duke's pages.
6: First Page: Well met, honest gentleman.
7: TOUCHSTONE: By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and a song.
8: Second Page: We are for you: sit i' the middle.
9: First Page: Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking or
10: spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only
11: prologues to a bad voice?
12: Second Page: I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two
13: gipsies on a horse.
14: SONG.
15: It was a lover and his lass,
16: With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
17: That o'er the green corn-field did pass
18: In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,
19: When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding:
20: Sweet lovers love the spring.
21: Between the acres of the rye,
22: With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino
23: These pretty country folks would lie,
24: In spring time, & c.
25: This carol they began that hour,
26: With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
27: How that a life was but a flower
28: In spring time, & c.
29: And therefore take the present time,
30: With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino;
31: For love is crowned with the prime
32: In spring time, & c.
33: TOUCHSTONE: Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great
34: matter in the ditty, yet the note was very
35: untuneable.
36: First Page: You are deceived, sir: we kept time, we lost not our time.
37: TOUCHSTONE: By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear
38: such a foolish song. God be wi' you; and God mend
39: your voices! Come, Audrey.
ACT 5 SCENE 4

1: DUKE SENIOR: Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
2: Can do all this that he hath promised?
3: ORLANDO: I sometimes do believe, and sometimes do not;
4: As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.
5: ROSALIND: Patience once more, whiles our compact is urged:
6: You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
7: You will bestow her on Orlando here?
8: DUKE SENIOR: That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
9: ROSALIND: And you say, you will have her, when I bring her?
10: ORLANDO: That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
11: ROSALIND: You say, you'll marry me, if I be willing?
12: PHEBE: That will I, should I die the hour after.
13: ROSALIND: But if you do refuse to marry me,
14: You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?
15: PHEBE: So is the bargain.
16: ROSALIND: You say, that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
17: SILVIUS: Though to have her and death were both one thing.
18: ROSALIND: I have promised to make all this matter even.
19: Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter;
20: You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter:
21: Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,
22: Or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd:
23: Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her.
24: If she refuse me: and from hence I go,
25: To make these doubts all even.
26: DUKE SENIOR: I do remember in this shepherd boy
27: Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.
28: ORLANDO: My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
29: Methought he was a brother to your daughter:
30: But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
31: And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
32: Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
33: Whom he reports to be a great magician,
34: Obscured in the circle of this forest.
35: JAQUES: There is, sure, another flood toward, and these
36: couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of
37: very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.
38: TOUCHSTONE: Salutation and greeting to you all!
39: JAQUES: Good my lord, bid him welcome: this is the
40: motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in
41: the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.
42: TOUCHSTONE: If any man doubt that, let him put me to my
43: purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered
44: a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth
45: with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have
46: had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.
47: JAQUES: And how was that ta'en up?
48: TOUCHSTONE: Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
49: seventh cause.
50: JAQUES: How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.
51: DUKE SENIOR: I like him very well.
52: TOUCHSTONE: God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I
53: press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country
54: copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as
55: marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,
56: sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor
57: humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else
58: will: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a
59: poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.
60: DUKE SENIOR: By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
61: TOUCHSTONE: According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.
62: JAQUES: But, for the seventh cause; how did you find the
63: quarrel on the seventh cause?
64: TOUCHSTONE: Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more
65: seeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the
66: cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,
67: if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the
68: mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.
69: If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he
70: would send me word, he cut it to please himself:
71: this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was
72: not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is
73: called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not
74: well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this
75: is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not
76: well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the
77: Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie
78: Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.
79: JAQUES: And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
80: TOUCHSTONE: I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,
81: nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we
82: measured swords and parted.
83: JAQUES: Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
84: TOUCHSTONE: O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have
85: books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.
86: The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the
87: Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the
88: fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the
89: Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with
90: Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All
91: these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may
92: avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven
93: justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the
94: parties were met themselves, one of them thought but
95: of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and
96: they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the
97: only peacemaker; much virtue in If.
98: JAQUES: Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at
99: any thing and yet a fool.
100: DUKE SENIOR: He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under
101: the presentation of that he shoots his wit.
102: HYMEN: Then is there mirth in heaven,
103: When earthly things made even
104: Atone together.
105: Good duke, receive thy daughter
106: Hymen from heaven brought her,
107: Yea, brought her hither,
108: That thou mightst join her hand with his
109: Whose heart within his bosom is.
110: ROSALIND: [To DUKE SENIOR] To you I give myself, for I am yours.
111: To you I give myself, for I am yours.
112: DUKE SENIOR: If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.
113: ORLANDO: If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.
114: PHEBE: If sight and shape be true,
115: Why then, my love adieu!
116: ROSALIND: I'll have no father, if you be not he:
117: I'll have no husband, if you be not he:
118: Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.
119: HYMEN: Peace, ho! I bar confusion:
120: 'Tis I must make conclusion
121: Of these most strange events:
122: Here's eight that must take hands
123: To join in Hymen's bands,
124: If truth holds true contents.
125: You and you no cross shall part:
126: You and you are heart in heart
127: You to his love must accord,
128: Or have a woman to your lord:
129: You and you are sure together,
130: As the winter to foul weather.
131: Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,
132: Feed yourselves with questioning;
133: That reason wonder may diminish,
134: How thus we met, and these things finish.
135: SONG.
136: Wedding is great Juno's crown:
137: O blessed bond of board and bed!
138: 'Tis Hymen peoples every town;
139: High wedlock then be honoured:
140: Honour, high honour and renown,
141: To Hymen, god of every town!
142: DUKE SENIOR: O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!
143: Even daughter, welcome, in no less degree.
144: PHEBE: I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;
145: Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.
146: JAQUES DE BOYS: Let me have audience for a word or two:
147: I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
148: That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
149: Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
150: Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
151: Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,
152: In his own conduct, purposely to take
153: His brother here and put him to the sword:
154: And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;
155: Where meeting with an old religious man,
156: After some question with him, was converted
157: Both from his enterprise and from the world,
158: His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,
159: And all their lands restored to them again
160: That were with him exiled. This to be true,
161: I do engage my life.
162: DUKE SENIOR: Welcome, young man;
163: Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
164: To one his lands withheld, and to the other
165: A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
166: First, in this forest, let us do those ends
167: That here were well begun and well begot:
168: And after, every of this happy number
169: That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
170: Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
171: According to the measure of their states.
172: Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity
173: And fall into our rustic revelry.
174: Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,
175: With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.
176: JAQUES: Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,
177: The duke hath put on a religious life
178: And thrown into neglect the pompous court?
179: JAQUES DE BOYS: He hath.
180: JAQUES: To him will I : out of these convertites
181: There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.
182: You to your former honour I bequeath;
183: Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:
184: You to a love that your true faith doth merit:
185: You to your land and love and great allies:
186: You to a long and well-deserved bed:
187: And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage
188: Is but for two months victuall'd. So, to your pleasures:
189: I am for other than for dancing measures.
190: DUKE SENIOR: Stay, Jaques, stay.
191: JAQUES: To see no pastime I what you would have
192: I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.
193: DUKE SENIOR: Proceed, proceed: we will begin these rites,
194: As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.
195: EPILOGUE
