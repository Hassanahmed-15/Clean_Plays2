ACT 1 SCENE 1

1: TROILUS: Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:
2: Why should I war without the walls of Troy,
3: That find such cruel battle here within?
4: Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
5: Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.
6: PANDARUS: Will this gear ne'er be mended?
7: TROILUS: The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,
8: Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;
9: But I am weaker than a woman's tear,
10: Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,
11: Less valiant than the virgin in the night
12: And skilless as unpractised infancy.
13: PANDARUS: Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,
14: I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will
15: have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.
16: TROILUS: Have I not tarried?
17: PANDARUS: Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry
18: the bolting.
19: TROILUS: Have I not tarried?
20: PANDARUS: Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.
21: TROILUS: Still have I tarried.
22: PANDARUS: Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word
23: 'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the
24: heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must
25: stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.
26: TROILUS: Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,
27: Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.
28: At Priam's royal table do I sit;
29: And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,--
30: So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?
31: PANDARUS: Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw
32: her look, or any woman else.
33: TROILUS: I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,
34: As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,
35: Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,
36: I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,
37: Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:
38: But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,
39: Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.
40: PANDARUS: An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--
41: well, go to--there were no more comparison between
42: the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I
43: would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would
44: somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I
45: will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but--
46: TROILUS: O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--
47: When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,
48: Reply not in how many fathoms deep
49: They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad
50: In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'
51: Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart
52: Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
53: Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,
54: In whose comparison all whites are ink,
55: Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure
56: The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense
57: Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,
58: As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;
59: But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,
60: Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
61: The knife that made it.
62: PANDARUS: I speak no more than truth.
63: TROILUS: Thou dost not speak so much.
64: PANDARUS: Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:
65: if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be
66: not, she has the mends in her own hands.
67: TROILUS: Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!
68: PANDARUS: I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of
69: her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and
70: between, but small thanks for my labour.
71: TROILUS: What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?
72: PANDARUS: Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair
73: as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as
74: fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care
75: I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.
76: TROILUS: Say I she is not fair?
77: PANDARUS: I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to
78: stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so
79: I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,
80: I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.
81: TROILUS: Pandarus,--
82: PANDARUS: Not I.
83: TROILUS: Sweet Pandarus,--
84: PANDARUS: Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I
85: found it, and there an end.
86: TROILUS: Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!
87: Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,
88: When with your blood you daily paint her thus.
89: I cannot fight upon this argument;
90: It is too starved a subject for my sword.
91: But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!
92: I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;
93: And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.
94: As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.
95: Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,
96: What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?
97: Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:
98: Between our Ilium and where she resides,
99: Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,
100: Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar
101: Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.
102: AENEAS: How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?
103: TROILUS: Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,
104: For womanish it is to be from thence.
105: What news, AEneas, from the field to-day?
106: AENEAS: That Paris is returned home and hurt.
107: TROILUS: By whom, AEneas?
108: AENEAS: Troilus, by Menelaus.
109: TROILUS: Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;
110: Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.
111: AENEAS: Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!
112: TROILUS: Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'
113: But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?
114: AENEAS: In all swift haste.
115: TROILUS: Come, go we then together.
ACT 1 SCENE 2

1: CRESSIDA: Who were those went by?
2: ALEXANDER: Queen Hecuba and Helen.
3: CRESSIDA: And whither go they?
4: ALEXANDER: Up to the eastern tower,
5: Whose height commands as subject all the vale,
6: To see the battle. Hector, whose patience
7: Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:
8: He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,
9: And, like as there were husbandry in war,
10: Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,
11: And to the field goes he; where every flower
12: Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw
13: In Hector's wrath.
14: CRESSIDA: What was his cause of anger?
15: ALEXANDER: The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks
16: A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;
17: They call him Ajax.
18: CRESSIDA: Good; and what of him?
19: ALEXANDER: They say he is a very man per se,
20: And stands alone.
21: CRESSIDA: So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.
22: ALEXANDER: This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their
23: particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,
24: churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man
25: into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his
26: valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with
27: discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he
28: hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he
29: carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without
30: cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the
31: joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint
32: that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,
33: or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.
34: CRESSIDA: But how should this man, that makes
35: me smile, make Hector angry?
36: ALEXANDER: They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and
37: struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath
38: ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.
39: CRESSIDA: Who comes here?
40: ALEXANDER: Madam, your uncle Pandarus.
41: CRESSIDA: Hector's a gallant man.
42: ALEXANDER: As may be in the world, lady.
43: PANDARUS: What's that? what's that?
44: CRESSIDA: Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.
45: PANDARUS: Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?
46: Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When
47: were you at Ilium?
48: CRESSIDA: This morning, uncle.
49: PANDARUS: What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector
50: armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not
51: up, was she?
52: CRESSIDA: Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.
53: PANDARUS: Even so: Hector was stirring early.
54: CRESSIDA: That were we talking of, and of his anger.
55: PANDARUS: Was he angry?
56: CRESSIDA: So he says here.
57: PANDARUS: True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay
58: about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's
59: Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take
60: heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.
61: CRESSIDA: What, is he angry too?
62: PANDARUS: Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.
63: CRESSIDA: O Jupiter! there's no comparison.
64: PANDARUS: What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a
65: man if you see him?
66: CRESSIDA: Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.
67: PANDARUS: Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.
68: CRESSIDA: Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.
69: PANDARUS: No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.
70: CRESSIDA: 'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.
71: PANDARUS: Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.
72: CRESSIDA: So he is.
73: PANDARUS: Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.
74: CRESSIDA: He is not Hector.
75: PANDARUS: Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were
76: himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend
77: or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were
78: in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.
79: CRESSIDA: Excuse me.
80: PANDARUS: He is elder.
81: CRESSIDA: Pardon me, pardon me.
82: PANDARUS: Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another
83: tale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not
84: have his wit this year.
85: CRESSIDA: He shall not need it, if he have his own.
86: PANDARUS: Nor his qualities.
87: CRESSIDA: No matter.
88: PANDARUS: Nor his beauty.
89: CRESSIDA: 'Twould not become him; his own's better.
90: PANDARUS: You have no judgment, niece: Helen
91: herself swore th' other day, that Troilus, for
92: a brown favour--for so 'tis, I must confess,--
93: not brown neither,--
94: CRESSIDA: No, but brown.
95: PANDARUS: 'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.
96: CRESSIDA: To say the truth, true and not true.
97: PANDARUS: She praised his complexion above Paris.
98: CRESSIDA: Why, Paris hath colour enough.
99: PANDARUS: So he has.
100: CRESSIDA: Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised
101: him above, his complexion is higher than his; he
102: having colour enough, and the other higher, is too
103: flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as
104: lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for
105: a copper nose.
106: PANDARUS: I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.
107: CRESSIDA: Then she's a merry Greek indeed.
108: PANDARUS: Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other
109: day into the compassed window,--and, you know, he
110: has not past three or four hairs on his chin,--
111: CRESSIDA: Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
112: particulars therein to a total.
113: PANDARUS: Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within
114: three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.
115: CRESSIDA: Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
116: PANDARUS: But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came
117: and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--
118: CRESSIDA: Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?
119: PANDARUS: Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling
120: becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.
121: CRESSIDA: O, he smiles valiantly.
122: PANDARUS: Does he not?
123: CRESSIDA: O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.
124: PANDARUS: Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen
125: loves Troilus,--
126: CRESSIDA: Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll
127: prove it so.
128: PANDARUS: Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem
129: an addle egg.
130: CRESSIDA: If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
131: head, you would eat chickens i' the shell.
132: PANDARUS: I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled
133: his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I
134: must needs confess,--
135: CRESSIDA: Without the rack.
136: PANDARUS: And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
137: CRESSIDA: Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.
138: PANDARUS: But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed
139: that her eyes ran o'er.
140: CRESSIDA: With mill-stones.
141: PANDARUS: And Cassandra laughed.
142: CRESSIDA: But there was more temperate fire under the pot of
143: her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?
144: PANDARUS: And Hector laughed.
145: CRESSIDA: At what was all this laughing?
146: PANDARUS: Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.
147: CRESSIDA: An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed
148: too.
149: PANDARUS: They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.
150: CRESSIDA: What was his answer?
151: PANDARUS: Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your
152: chin, and one of them is white.
153: CRESSIDA: This is her question.
154: PANDARUS: That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and
155: fifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that white
156: hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.'
157: 'Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris,
158: my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck't
159: out, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!
160: and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the
161: rest so laughed, that it passed.
162: CRESSIDA: So let it now; for it has been while going by.
163: PANDARUS: Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.
164: CRESSIDA: So I do.
165: PANDARUS: I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, an 'twere
166: a man born in April.
167: CRESSIDA: And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle
168: against May.
169: PANDARUS: Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we
170: stand up here, and see them as they pass toward
171: Ilium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.
172: CRESSIDA: At your pleasure.
173: PANDARUS: Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may
174: see most bravely: I'll tell you them all by their
175: names as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.
176: CRESSIDA: Speak not so loud.
177: PANDARUS: That's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one of
178: the flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but mark
179: Troilus; you shall see anon.
180: CRESSIDA: Who's that?
181: PANDARUS: That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you;
182: and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundest
183: judgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person.
184: When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: if
185: he see me, you shall see him nod at me.
186: CRESSIDA: Will he give you the nod?
187: PANDARUS: You shall see.
188: CRESSIDA: If he do, the rich shall have more.
189: PANDARUS: That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a
190: fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man,
191: niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
192: a countenance! is't not a brave man?
193: CRESSIDA: O, a brave man!
194: PANDARUS: Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look you
195: what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do
196: you see? look you there: there's no jesting;
197: there's laying on, take't off who will, as they say:
198: there be hacks!
199: CRESSIDA: Be those with swords?
200: PANDARUS: Swords! any thing, he cares not; an the devil come
201: to him, it's all one: by God's lid, it does one's
202: heart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.
203: Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too,
204: is't not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came
205: hurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why, this will do
206: Helen's heart good now, ha! Would I could see
207: Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.
208: CRESSIDA: Who's that?
209: PANDARUS: That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's
210: Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.
211: CRESSIDA: Can Helenus fight, uncle?
212: PANDARUS: Helenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I
213: marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the
214: people cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.
215: CRESSIDA: What sneaking fellow comes yonder?
216: PANDARUS: Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!
217: there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the
218: prince of chivalry!
219: CRESSIDA: Peace, for shame, peace!
220: PANDARUS: Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon
221: him, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, and
222: his helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks,
223: and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er saw
224: three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!
225: Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,
226: he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?
227: Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to
228: change, would give an eye to boot.
229: CRESSIDA: Here come more.
230: PANDARUS: Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!
231: porridge after meat! I could live and die i' the
232: eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eagles
233: are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had
234: rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and
235: all Greece.
236: CRESSIDA: There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.
237: PANDARUS: Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel.
238: CRESSIDA: Well, well.
239: PANDARUS: 'Well, well!' why, have you any discretion? have
240: you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not
241: birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,
242: learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality,
243: and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?
244: CRESSIDA: Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no date
245: in the pie, for then the man's date's out.
246: PANDARUS: You are such a woman! one knows not at what ward you
247: lie.
248: CRESSIDA: Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to
249: defend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine
250: honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, to
251: defend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at a
252: thousand watches.
253: PANDARUS: Say one of your watches.
254: CRESSIDA: Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the
255: chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would
256: not have hit, I can watch you for telling how I took
257: the blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it's
258: past watching.
259: PANDARUS: You are such another!
260: Boy: Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.
261: PANDARUS: Where?
262: Boy: At your own house; there he unarms him.
263: PANDARUS: Good boy, tell him I come.
264: I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.
265: CRESSIDA: Adieu, uncle.
266: PANDARUS: I'll be with you, niece, by and by.
267: CRESSIDA: To bring, uncle?
268: PANDARUS: Ay, a token from Troilus.
269: CRESSIDA: By the same token, you are a bawd.
270: Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,
271: He offers in another's enterprise;
272: But more in Troilus thousand fold I see
273: Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;
274: Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:
275: Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.
276: That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:
277: Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:
278: That she was never yet that ever knew
279: Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.
280: Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
281: Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech:
282: Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,
283: Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.
ACT 1 SCENE 3

1: AGAMEMNON: Princes,
2: What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?
3: The ample proposition that hope makes
4: In all designs begun on earth below
5: Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters
6: Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,
7: As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
8: Infect the sound pine and divert his grain
9: Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
10: Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
11: That we come short of our suppose so far
12: That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;
13: Sith every action that hath gone before,
14: Whereof we have record, trial did draw
15: Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,
16: And that unbodied figure of the thought
17: That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,
18: Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,
19: And call them shames? which are indeed nought else
20: But the protractive trials of great Jove
21: To find persistive constancy in men:
22: The fineness of which metal is not found
23: In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,
24: The wise and fool, the artist and unread,
25: The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:
26: But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,
27: Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,
28: Puffing at all, winnows the light away;
29: And what hath mass or matter, by itself
30: Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.
31: NESTOR: With due observance of thy godlike seat,
32: Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply
33: Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance
34: Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,
35: How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
36: Upon her patient breast, making their way
37: With those of nobler bulk!
38: But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
39: The gentle Thetis, and anon behold
40: The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,
41: Bounding between the two moist elements,
42: Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
43: Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
44: Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,
45: Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
46: Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
47: In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness
48: The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
49: Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind
50: Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,
51: And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage
52: As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,
53: And with an accent tuned in selfsame key
54: Retorts to chiding fortune.
55: ULYSSES: Agamemnon,
56: Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,
57: Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit.
58: In whom the tempers and the minds of all
59: Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.
60: Besides the applause and approbation To which,
61: most mighty for thy place and sway,
62: And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life
63: I give to both your speeches, which were such
64: As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
65: Should hold up high in brass, and such again
66: As venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,
67: Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree
68: On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears
69: To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,
70: Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.
71: AGAMEMNON: Speak, prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect
72: That matter needless, of importless burden,
73: Divide thy lips, than we are confident,
74: When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,
75: We shall hear music, wit and oracle.
76: ULYSSES: Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,
77: And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,
78: But for these instances.
79: The specialty of rule hath been neglected:
80: And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand
81: Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.
82: When that the general is not like the hive
83: To whom the foragers shall all repair,
84: What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,
85: The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.
86: The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre
87: Observe degree, priority and place,
88: Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,
89: Office and custom, in all line of order;
90: And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
91: In noble eminence enthroned and sphered
92: Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye
93: Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,
94: And posts, like the commandment of a king,
95: Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets
96: In evil mixture to disorder wander,
97: What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!
98: What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!
99: Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,
100: Divert and crack, rend and deracinate
101: The unity and married calm of states
102: Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,
103: Which is the ladder to all high designs,
104: Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,
105: Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,
106: Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
107: The primogenitive and due of birth,
108: Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,
109: But by degree, stand in authentic place?
110: Take but degree away, untune that string,
111: And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets
112: In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters
113: Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
114: And make a sop of all this solid globe:
115: Strength should be lord of imbecility,
116: And the rude son should strike his father dead:
117: Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,
118: Between whose endless jar justice resides,
119: Should lose their names, and so should justice too.
120: Then every thing includes itself in power,
121: Power into will, will into appetite;
122: And appetite, an universal wolf,
123: So doubly seconded with will and power,
124: Must make perforce an universal prey,
125: And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,
126: This chaos, when degree is suffocate,
127: Follows the choking.
128: And this neglection of degree it is
129: That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose
130: It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd
131: By him one step below, he by the next,
132: That next by him beneath; so every step,
133: Exampled by the first pace that is sick
134: Of his superior, grows to an envious fever
135: Of pale and bloodless emulation:
136: And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,
137: Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,
138: Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.
139: NESTOR: Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd
140: The fever whereof all our power is sick.
141: AGAMEMNON: The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,
142: What is the remedy?
143: ULYSSES: The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns
144: The sinew and the forehand of our host,
145: Having his ear full of his airy fame,
146: Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
147: Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus
148: Upon a lazy bed the livelong day
149: Breaks scurril jests;
150: And with ridiculous and awkward action,
151: Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,
152: He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,
153: Thy topless deputation he puts on,
154: And, like a strutting player, whose conceit
155: Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
156: To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
157: 'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,--
158: Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming
159: He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,
160: 'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,
161: Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd
162: Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff
163: The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,
164: From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
165: Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.
166: Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,
167: As he being drest to some oration.'
168: That's done, as near as the extremest ends
169: Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:
170: Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!
171: 'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
172: Arming to answer in a night alarm.'
173: And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
174: Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,
175: And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,
176: Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport
177: Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;
178: Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
179: In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,
180: All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
181: Severals and generals of grace exact,
182: Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,
183: Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,
184: Success or loss, what is or is not, serves
185: As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.
186: NESTOR: And in the imitation of these twain--
187: Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns
188: With an imperial voice--many are infect.
189: Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his head
190: In such a rein, in full as proud a place
191: As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;
192: Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,
193: Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,
194: A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
195: To match us in comparisons with dirt,
196: To weaken and discredit our exposure,
197: How rank soever rounded in with danger.
198: ULYSSES: They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,
199: Count wisdom as no member of the war,
200: Forestall prescience, and esteem no act
201: But that of hand: the still and mental parts,
202: That do contrive how many hands shall strike,
203: When fitness calls them on, and know by measure
204: Of their observant toil the enemies' weight,--
205: Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:
206: They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;
207: So that the ram that batters down the wall,
208: For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,
209: They place before his hand that made the engine,
210: Or those that with the fineness of their souls
211: By reason guide his execution.
212: NESTOR: Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
213: Makes many Thetis' sons.
214: AGAMEMNON: What trumpet? look, Menelaus.
215: MENELAUS: From Troy.
216: AGAMEMNON: What would you 'fore our tent?
217: AENEAS: Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?
218: AGAMEMNON: Even this.
219: AENEAS: May one, that is a herald and a prince,
220: Do a fair message to his kingly ears?
221: AGAMEMNON: With surety stronger than Achilles' arm
222: 'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice
223: Call Agamemnon head and general.
224: AENEAS: Fair leave and large security. How may
225: A stranger to those most imperial looks
226: Know them from eyes of other mortals?
227: AGAMEMNON: How!
228: AENEAS: Ay;
229: I ask, that I might waken reverence,
230: And bid the cheek be ready with a blush
231: Modest as morning when she coldly eyes
232: The youthful Phoebus:
233: Which is that god in office, guiding men?
234: Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?
235: AGAMEMNON: This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy
236: Are ceremonious courtiers.
237: AENEAS: Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,
238: As bending angels; that's their fame in peace:
239: But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,
240: Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and,
241: Jove's accord,
242: Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,
243: Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!
244: The worthiness of praise distains his worth,
245: If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:
246: But what the repining enemy commends,
247: That breath fame blows; that praise, sole sure,
248: transcends.
249: AGAMEMNON: Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas?
250: AENEAS: Ay, Greek, that is my name.
251: AGAMEMNON: What's your affair I pray you?
252: AENEAS: Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.
253: AGAMEMNON: He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.
254: AENEAS: Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him:
255: I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,
256: To set his sense on the attentive bent,
257: And then to speak.
258: AGAMEMNON: Speak frankly as the wind;
259: It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:
260: That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,
261: He tells thee so himself.
262: AENEAS: Trumpet, blow loud,
263: Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;
264: And every Greek of mettle, let him know,
265: What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.
266: We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy
267: A prince call'd Hector,--Priam is his father,--
268: Who in this dull and long-continued truce
269: Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,
270: And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!
271: If there be one among the fair'st of Greece
272: That holds his honour higher than his ease,
273: That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,
274: That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,
275: That loves his mistress more than in confession,
276: With truant vows to her own lips he loves,
277: And dare avow her beauty and her worth
278: In other arms than hers,--to him this challenge.
279: Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,
280: Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,
281: He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,
282: Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,
283: And will to-morrow with his trumpet call
284: Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,
285: To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:
286: If any come, Hector shall honour him;
287: If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,
288: The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
289: The splinter of a lance. Even so much.
290: AGAMEMNON: This shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas;
291: If none of them have soul in such a kind,
292: We left them all at home: but we are soldiers;
293: And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,
294: That means not, hath not, or is not in love!
295: If then one is, or hath, or means to be,
296: That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.
297: NESTOR: Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man
298: When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;
299: But if there be not in our Grecian host
300: One noble man that hath one spark of fire,
301: To answer for his love, tell him from me
302: I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
303: And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,
304: And meeting him will tell him that my lady
305: Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
306: As may be in the world: his youth in flood,
307: I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.
308: AENEAS: Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!
309: ULYSSES: Amen.
310: AGAMEMNON: Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand;
311: To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.
312: Achilles shall have word of this intent;
313: So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:
314: Yourself shall feast with us before you go
315: And find the welcome of a noble foe.
316: ULYSSES: Nestor!
317: NESTOR: What says Ulysses?
318: ULYSSES: I have a young conception in my brain;
319: Be you my time to bring it to some shape.
320: NESTOR: What is't?
321: ULYSSES: This 'tis:
322: Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride
323: That hath to this maturity blown up
324: In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,
325: Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,
326: To overbulk us all.
327: NESTOR: Well, and how?
328: ULYSSES: This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,
329: However it is spread in general name,
330: Relates in purpose only to Achilles.
331: NESTOR: The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,
332: Whose grossness little characters sum up:
333: And, in the publication, make no strain,
334: But that Achilles, were his brain as barren
335: As banks of Libya,--though, Apollo knows,
336: 'Tis dry enough,--will, with great speed of judgment,
337: Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose
338: Pointing on him.
339: ULYSSES: And wake him to the answer, think you?
340: NESTOR: Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,
341: That can from Hector bring his honour off,
342: If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,
343: Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;
344: For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute
345: With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,
346: Our imputation shall be oddly poised
347: In this wild action; for the success,
348: Although particular, shall give a scantling
349: Of good or bad unto the general;
350: And in such indexes, although small pricks
351: To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
352: The baby figure of the giant mass
353: Of things to come at large. It is supposed
354: He that meets Hector issues from our choice
355: And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,
356: Makes merit her election, and doth boil,
357: As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd
358: Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,
359: What heart receives from hence the conquering part,
360: To steel a strong opinion to themselves?
361: Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,
362: In no less working than are swords and bows
363: Directive by the limbs.
364: ULYSSES: Give pardon to my speech:
365: Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.
366: Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,
367: And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not,
368: The lustre of the better yet to show,
369: Shall show the better. Do not consent
370: That ever Hector and Achilles meet;
371: For both our honour and our shame in this
372: Are dogg'd with two strange followers.
373: NESTOR: I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?
374: ULYSSES: What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,
375: Were he not proud, we all should share with him:
376: But he already is too insolent;
377: A nd we were better parch in Afric sun
378: Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,
379: Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,
380: Why then, we did our main opinion crush
381: In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;
382: And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw
383: The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves
384: Give him allowance for the better man;
385: For that will physic the great Myrmidon
386: Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall
387: His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.
388: If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,
389: We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,
390: Yet go we under our opinion still
391: That we have better men. But, hit or miss,
392: Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:
393: Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.
ACT 2 SCENE 1

1: AJAX: Thersites!
2: THERSITES: Agamemnon, how if he had boils? full, all over,
3: generally?
4: AJAX: Thersites!
5: THERSITES: And those boils did run? say so: did not the
6: general run then? were not that a botchy core?
7: AJAX: Dog!
8: THERSITES: Then would come some matter from him; I see none now.
9: AJAX: Thou bitch-wolf's son, canst thou not hear?
10: Feel, then.
11: THERSITES: The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel
12: beef-witted lord!
13: AJAX: Speak then, thou vinewedst leaven, speak: I will
14: beat thee into handsomeness.
15: THERSITES: I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness: but,
16: I think, thy horse will sooner con an oration than
17: thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike,
18: canst thou? a red murrain o' thy jade's tricks!
19: AJAX: Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.
20: THERSITES: Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest me thus?
21: AJAX: The proclamation!
22: THERSITES: Thou art proclaimed a fool, I think.
23: AJAX: Do not, porpentine, do not: my fingers itch.
24: THERSITES: I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had
25: the scratching of thee; I would make thee the
26: loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou art forth in
27: the incursions, thou strikest as slow as another.
28: AJAX: I say, the proclamation!
29: THERSITES: Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles,
30: and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as
31: Cerberus is at Proserpine's beauty, ay, that thou
32: barkest at him.
33: AJAX: Mistress Thersites!
34: THERSITES: Thou shouldest strike him.
35: AJAX: Cobloaf!
36: THERSITES: He would pun thee into shivers with his fist, as a
37: sailor breaks a biscuit.
38: AJAX: [Beating him] You whoreson cur!
39: THERSITES: Do, do.
40: AJAX: Thou stool for a witch!
41: THERSITES: Ay, do, do; thou sodden-witted lord! thou hast no
42: more brain than I have in mine elbows; an assinego
43: may tutor thee: thou scurvy-valiant ass! thou art
44: here but to thrash Trojans; and thou art bought and
45: sold among those of any wit, like a barbarian slave.
46: If thou use to beat me, I will begin at thy heel, and
47: tell what thou art by inches, thou thing of no
48: bowels, thou!
49: AJAX: You dog!
50: THERSITES: You scurvy lord!
51: AJAX: [Beating him] You cur!
52: THERSITES: Mars his idiot! do, rudeness; do, camel; do, do.
53: ACHILLES: Why, how now, Ajax! wherefore do you thus? How now,
54: Thersites! what's the matter, man?
55: THERSITES: You see him there, do you?
56: ACHILLES: Ay; what's the matter?
57: THERSITES: Nay, look upon him.
58: ACHILLES: So I do: what's the matter?
59: THERSITES: Nay, but regard him well.
60: ACHILLES: 'Well!' why, I do so.
61: THERSITES: But yet you look not well upon him; for whosoever you
62: take him to be, he is Ajax.
63: ACHILLES: I know that, fool.
64: THERSITES: Ay, but that fool knows not himself.
65: AJAX: Therefore I beat thee.
66: THERSITES: Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! his
67: evasions have ears thus long. I have bobbed his
68: brain more than he has beat my bones: I will buy
69: nine sparrows for a penny, and his pia mater is not
70: worth the nineth part of a sparrow. This lord,
71: Achilles, Ajax, who wears his wit in his belly and
72: his guts in his head, I'll tell you what I say of
73: him.
74: ACHILLES: What?
75: THERSITES: I say, this Ajax--
76: ACHILLES: Nay, good Ajax.
77: THERSITES: Has not so much wit--
78: ACHILLES: Nay, I must hold you.
79: THERSITES: As will stop the eye of Helen's needle, for whom he
80: comes to fight.
81: ACHILLES: Peace, fool!
82: THERSITES: I would have peace and quietness, but the fool will
83: not: he there: that he: look you there.
84: AJAX: O thou damned cur! I shall--
85: ACHILLES: Will you set your wit to a fool's?
86: THERSITES: No, I warrant you; for a fools will shame it.
87: PATROCLUS: Good words, Thersites.
88: ACHILLES: What's the quarrel?
89: AJAX: I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the
90: proclamation, and he rails upon me.
91: THERSITES: I serve thee not.
92: AJAX: Well, go to, go to.
93: THERSITES: I serve here voluntarily.
94: ACHILLES: Your last service was sufferance, 'twas not
95: voluntary: no man is beaten voluntary: Ajax was
96: here the voluntary, and you as under an impress.
97: THERSITES: E'en so; a great deal of your wit, too, lies in your
98: sinews, or else there be liars. Hector have a great
99: catch, if he knock out either of your brains: a'
100: were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel.
101: ACHILLES: What, with me too, Thersites?
102: THERSITES: There's Ulysses and old Nestor, whose wit was mouldy
103: ere your grandsires had nails on their toes, yoke you
104: like draught-oxen and make you plough up the wars.
105: ACHILLES: What, what?
106: THERSITES: Yes, good sooth: to, Achilles! to, Ajax! to!
107: AJAX: I shall cut out your tongue.
108: THERSITES: 'Tis no matter! I shall speak as much as thou
109: afterwards.
110: PATROCLUS: No more words, Thersites; peace!
111: THERSITES: I will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me, shall I?
112: ACHILLES: There's for you, Patroclus.
113: THERSITES: I will see you hanged, like clotpoles, ere I come
114: any more to your tents: I will keep where there is
115: wit stirring and leave the faction of fools.
116: PATROCLUS: A good riddance.
117: ACHILLES: Marry, this, sir, is proclaim'd through all our host:
118: That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,
119: Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy
120: To-morrow morning call some knight to arms
121: That hath a stomach; and such a one that dare
122: Maintain--I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.
123: AJAX: Farewell. Who shall answer him?
124: ACHILLES: I know not: 'tis put to lottery; otherwise
125: He knew his man.
126: AJAX: O, meaning you. I will go learn more of it.
ACT 2 SCENE 2

1: PRIAM: After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,
2: Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:
3: 'Deliver Helen, and all damage else--
4: As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,
5: Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed
6: In hot digestion of this cormorant war--
7: Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?
8: HECTOR: Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
9: As far as toucheth my particular,
10: Yet, dread Priam,
11: There is no lady of more softer bowels,
12: More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,
13: More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'
14: Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,
15: Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd
16: The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches
17: To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:
18: Since the first sword was drawn about this question,
19: Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,
20: Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:
21: If we have lost so many tenths of ours,
22: To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,
23: Had it our name, the value of one ten,
24: What merit's in that reason which denies
25: The yielding of her up?
26: TROILUS: Fie, fie, my brother!
27: Weigh you the worth and honour of a king
28: So great as our dread father in a scale
29: Of common ounces? will you with counters sum
30: The past proportion of his infinite?
31: And buckle in a waist most fathomless
32: With spans and inches so diminutive
33: As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!
34: HELENUS: No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,
35: You are so empty of them. Should not our father
36: Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,
37: Because your speech hath none that tells him so?
38: TROILUS: You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;
39: You fur your gloves with reason. Here are
40: your reasons:
41: You know an enemy intends you harm;
42: You know a sword employ'd is perilous,
43: And reason flies the object of all harm:
44: Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds
45: A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
46: The very wings of reason to his heels
47: And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,
48: Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,
49: Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour
50: Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat
51: their thoughts
52: With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect
53: Make livers pale and lustihood deject.
54: HECTOR: Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost
55: The holding.
56: TROILUS: What is aught, but as 'tis valued?
57: HECTOR: But value dwells not in particular will;
58: It holds his estimate and dignity
59: As well wherein 'tis precious of itself
60: As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry
61: To make the service greater than the god
62: And the will dotes that is attributive
63: To what infectiously itself affects,
64: Without some image of the affected merit.
65: TROILUS: I take to-day a wife, and my election
66: Is led on in the conduct of my will;
67: My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,
68: Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores
69: Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,
70: Although my will distaste what it elected,
71: The wife I chose? there can be no evasion
72: To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:
73: We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,
74: When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands
75: We do not throw in unrespective sieve,
76: Because we now are full. It was thought meet
77: Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:
78: Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;
79: The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce
80: And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,
81: And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,
82: He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness
83: Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.
84: Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:
85: Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,
86: Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,
87: And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.
88: If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--
89: As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'--
90: If you'll confess he brought home noble prize--
91: As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands
92: And cried 'Inestimable!'--why do you now
93: The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,
94: And do a deed that fortune never did,
95: Beggar the estimation which you prized
96: Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
97: That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!
98: But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,
99: That in their country did them that disgrace,
100: We fear to warrant in our native place!
101: CASSANDRA: [Within] Cry, Trojans, cry!
102: PRIAM: What noise? what shriek is this?
103: TROILUS: 'Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice.
104: CASSANDRA: [Within] Cry, Trojans!
105: HECTOR: It is Cassandra.
106: CASSANDRA: Cry, Trojans, cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,
107: And I will fill them with prophetic tears.
108: HECTOR: Peace, sister, peace!
109: CASSANDRA: Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,
110: Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,
111: Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes
112: A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
113: Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!
114: Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;
115: Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.
116: Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe:
117: Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.
118: HECTOR: Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
119: Of divination in our sister work
120: Some touches of remorse? or is your blood
121: So madly hot that no discourse of reason,
122: Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,
123: Can qualify the same?
124: TROILUS: Why, brother Hector,
125: We may not think the justness of each act
126: Such and no other than event doth form it,
127: Nor once deject the courage of our minds,
128: Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick raptures
129: Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
130: Which hath our several honours all engaged
131: To make it gracious. For my private part,
132: I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:
133: And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
134: Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
135: To fight for and maintain!
136: PARIS: Else might the world convince of levity
137: As well my undertakings as your counsels:
138: But I attest the gods, your full consent
139: Gave wings to my propension and cut off
140: All fears attending on so dire a project.
141: For what, alas, can these my single arms?
142: What Propugnation is in one man's valour,
143: To stand the push and enmity of those
144: This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,
145: Were I alone to pass the difficulties
146: And had as ample power as I have will,
147: Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,
148: Nor faint in the pursuit.
149: PRIAM: Paris, you speak
150: Like one besotted on your sweet delights:
151: You have the honey still, but these the gall;
152: So to be valiant is no praise at all.
153: PARIS: Sir, I propose not merely to myself
154: The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;
155: But I would have the soil of her fair rape
156: Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.
157: What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,
158: Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,
159: Now to deliver her possession up
160: On terms of base compulsion! Can it be
161: That so degenerate a strain as this
162: Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
163: There's not the meanest spirit on our party
164: Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
165: When Helen is defended, nor none so noble
166: Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed
167: Where Helen is the subject; then, I say,
168: Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,
169: The world's large spaces cannot parallel.
170: HECTOR: Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,
171: And on the cause and question now in hand
172: Have glozed, but superficially: not much
173: Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
174: Unfit to hear moral philosophy:
175: The reasons you allege do more conduce
176: To the hot passion of distemper'd blood
177: Than to make up a free determination
178: 'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge
179: Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
180: Of any true decision. Nature craves
181: All dues be render'd to their owners: now,
182: What nearer debt in all humanity
183: Than wife is to the husband? If this law
184: Of nature be corrupted through affection,
185: And that great minds, of partial indulgence
186: To their benumbed wills, resist the same,
187: There is a law in each well-order'd nation
188: To curb those raging appetites that are
189: Most disobedient and refractory.
190: If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,
191: As it is known she is, these moral laws
192: Of nature and of nations speak aloud
193: To have her back return'd: thus to persist
194: In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
195: But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion
196: Is this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless,
197: My spritely brethren, I propend to you
198: In resolution to keep Helen still,
199: For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance
200: Upon our joint and several dignities.
201: TROILUS: Why, there you touch'd the life of our design:
202: Were it not glory that we more affected
203: Than the performance of our heaving spleens,
204: I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood
205: Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,
206: She is a theme of honour and renown,
207: A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
208: Whose present courage may beat down our foes,
209: And fame in time to come canonize us;
210: For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose
211: So rich advantage of a promised glory
212: As smiles upon the forehead of this action
213: For the wide world's revenue.
214: HECTOR: I am yours,
215: You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
216: I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
217: The dun and factious nobles of the Greeks
218: Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:
219: I was advertised their great general slept,
220: Whilst emulation in the army crept:
221: This, I presume, will wake him.
ACT 2 SCENE 3

1: THERSITES: How now, Thersites! what lost in the labyrinth of
2: thy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He
3: beats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction!
4: would it were otherwise; that I could beat him,
5: whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn to
6: conjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue of
7: my spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, a
8: rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two
9: undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of
10: themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,
11: forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods and,
12: Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy
13: caduceus, if ye take not that little, little less
14: than little wit from them that they have! which
15: short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant
16: scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly
17: from a spider, without drawing their massy irons and
18: cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the
19: whole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,
20: methinks, is the curse dependent on those that war
21: for a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envy
22: say Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!
23: PATROCLUS: Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.
24: THERSITES: If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit, thou
25: wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: but
26: it is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The common
27: curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in
28: great revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor, and
29: discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy
30: direction till thy death! then if she that lays thee
31: out says thou art a fair corse, I'll be sworn and
32: sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars.
33: Amen. Where's Achilles?
34: PATROCLUS: What, art thou devout? wast thou in prayer?
35: THERSITES: Ay: the heavens hear me!
36: ACHILLES: Who's there?
37: PATROCLUS: Thersites, my lord.
38: ACHILLES: Where, where? Art thou come? why, my cheese, my
39: digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to
40: my table so many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon?
41: THERSITES: Thy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus,
42: what's Achilles?
43: PATROCLUS: Thy lord, Thersites: then tell me, I pray thee,
44: what's thyself?
45: THERSITES: Thy knower, Patroclus: then tell me, Patroclus,
46: what art thou?
47: PATROCLUS: Thou mayst tell that knowest.
48: ACHILLES: O, tell, tell.
49: THERSITES: I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands
50: Achilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus'
51: knower, and Patroclus is a fool.
52: PATROCLUS: You rascal!
53: THERSITES: Peace, fool! I have not done.
54: ACHILLES: He is a privileged man. Proceed, Thersites.
55: THERSITES: Agamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites
56: is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.
57: ACHILLES: Derive this; come.
58: THERSITES: Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles;
59: Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon;
60: Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool, and
61: Patroclus is a fool positive.
62: PATROCLUS: Why am I a fool?
63: THERSITES: Make that demand of the prover. It suffices me thou
64: art. Look you, who comes here?
65: ACHILLES: Patroclus, I'll speak with nobody.
66: Come in with me, Thersites.
67: THERSITES: Here is such patchery, such juggling and such
68: knavery! all the argument is a cuckold and a
69: whore; a good quarrel to draw emulous factions
70: and bleed to death upon. Now, the dry serpigo on
71: the subject! and war and lechery confound all!
72: AGAMEMNON: Where is Achilles?
73: PATROCLUS: Within his tent; but ill disposed, my lord.
74: AGAMEMNON: Let it be known to him that we are here.
75: He shent our messengers; and we lay by
76: Our appertainments, visiting of him:
77: Let him be told so; lest perchance he think
78: We dare not move the question of our place,
79: Or know not what we are.
80: PATROCLUS: I shall say so to him.
81: ULYSSES: We saw him at the opening of his tent:
82: He is not sick.
83: AJAX: Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart: you may call it
84: melancholy, if you will favour the man; but, by my
85: head, 'tis pride: but why, why? let him show us the
86: cause. A word, my lord.
87: NESTOR: What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?
88: ULYSSES: Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.
89: NESTOR: Who, Thersites?
90: ULYSSES: He.
91: NESTOR: Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.
92: ULYSSES: No, you see, he is his argument that has his
93: argument, Achilles.
94: NESTOR: All the better; their fraction is more our wish than
95: their faction: but it was a strong composure a fool
96: could disunite.
97: ULYSSES: The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily
98: untie. Here comes Patroclus.
99: NESTOR: No Achilles with him.
100: ULYSSES: The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy:
101: his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.
102: PATROCLUS: Achilles bids me say, he is much sorry,
103: If any thing more than your sport and pleasure
104: Did move your greatness and this noble state
105: To call upon him; he hopes it is no other
106: But for your health and your digestion sake,
107: And after-dinner's breath.
108: AGAMEMNON: Hear you, Patroclus:
109: We are too well acquainted with these answers:
110: But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,
111: Cannot outfly our apprehensions.
112: Much attribute he hath, and much the reason
113: Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,
114: Not virtuously on his own part beheld,
115: Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,
116: Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,
117: Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,
118: We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,
119: If you do say we think him over-proud
120: And under-honest, in self-assumption greater
121: Than in the note of judgment; and worthier
122: than himself
123: Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,
124: Disguise the holy strength of their command,
125: And underwrite in an observing kind
126: His humorous predominance; yea, watch
127: His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if
128: The passage and whole carriage of this action
129: Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
130: That if he overhold his price so much,
131: We'll none of him; but let him, like an engine
132: Not portable, lie under this report:
133: 'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:
134: A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
135: Before a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.
136: PATROCLUS: I shall; and bring his answer presently.
137: AGAMEMNON: In second voice we'll not be satisfied;
138: We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.
139: AJAX: What is he more than another?
140: AGAMEMNON: No more than what he thinks he is.
141: AJAX: Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a
142: better man than I am?
143: AGAMEMNON: No question.
144: AJAX: Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?
145: AGAMEMNON: No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as
146: wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether
147: more tractable.
148: AJAX: Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I
149: know not what pride is.
150: AGAMEMNON: Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the
151: fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is
152: his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle;
153: and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours
154: the deed in the praise.
155: AJAX: I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads.
156: NESTOR: Yet he loves himself: is't not strange?
157: ULYSSES: Achilles will not to the field to-morrow.
158: AGAMEMNON: What's his excuse?
159: ULYSSES: He doth rely on none,
160: But carries on the stream of his dispose
161: Without observance or respect of any,
162: In will peculiar and in self-admission.
163: AGAMEMNON: Why will he not upon our fair request
164: Untent his person and share the air with us?
165: ULYSSES: Things small as nothing, for request's sake only,
166: He makes important: possess'd he is with greatness,
167: And speaks not to himself but with a pride
168: That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth
169: Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
170: That 'twixt his mental and his active parts
171: Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages
172: And batters down himself: what should I say?
173: He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it
174: Cry 'No recovery.'
175: AGAMEMNON: Let Ajax go to him.
176: Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:
177: 'Tis said he holds you well, and will be led
178: At your request a little from himself.
179: ULYSSES: O Agamemnon, let it not be so!
180: We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes
181: When they go from Achilles: shall the proud lord
182: That bastes his arrogance with his own seam
183: And never suffers matter of the world
184: Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
185: And ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp'd
186: Of that we hold an idol more than he?
187: No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord
188: Must not so stale his palm, nobly acquired;
189: Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,
190: As amply titled as Achilles is,
191: By going to Achilles:
192: That were to enlard his fat already pride
193: And add more coals to Cancer when he burns
194: With entertaining great Hyperion.
195: This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,
196: And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'
197: NESTOR: [Aside to DIOMEDES] O, this is well; he rubs the
198: vein of him.
199: DIOMEDES: [Aside to NESTOR] And how his silence drinks up
200: this applause!
201: AJAX: If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face.
202: AGAMEMNON: O, no, you shall not go.
203: AJAX: An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride:
204: Let me go to him.
205: ULYSSES: Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.
206: AJAX: A paltry, insolent fellow!
207: NESTOR: How he describes himself!
208: AJAX: Can he not be sociable?
209: ULYSSES: The raven chides blackness.
210: AJAX: I'll let his humours blood.
211: AGAMEMNON: He will be the physician that should be the patient.
212: AJAX: An all men were o' my mind,--
213: ULYSSES: Wit would be out of fashion.
214: AJAX: A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first:
215: shall pride carry it?
216: NESTOR: An 'twould, you'ld carry half.
217: ULYSSES: A' would have ten shares.
218: AJAX: I will knead him; I'll make him supple.
219: NESTOR: He's not yet through warm: force him with praises:
220: pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.
221: ULYSSES: [To AGAMEMNON] My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.
222: NESTOR: Our noble general, do not do so.
223: DIOMEDES: You must prepare to fight without Achilles.
224: ULYSSES: Why, 'tis this naming of him does him harm.
225: Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;
226: I will be silent.
227: NESTOR: Wherefore should you so?
228: He is not emulous, as Achilles is.
229: ULYSSES: Know the whole world, he is as valiant.
230: AJAX: A whoreson dog, that shall pelter thus with us!
231: Would he were a Trojan!
232: NESTOR: What a vice were it in Ajax now,--
233: ULYSSES: If he were proud,--
234: DIOMEDES: Or covetous of praise,--
235: ULYSSES: Ay, or surly borne,--
236: DIOMEDES: Or strange, or self-affected!
237: ULYSSES: Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure;
238: Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck:
239: Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature
240: Thrice famed, beyond all erudition:
241: But he that disciplined thy arms to fight,
242: Let Mars divide eternity in twain,
243: And give him half: and, for thy vigour,
244: Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield
245: To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,
246: Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines
247: Thy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor;
248: Instructed by the antiquary times,
249: He must, he is, he cannot but be wise:
250: Put pardon, father Nestor, were your days
251: As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,
252: You should not have the eminence of him,
253: But be as Ajax.
254: AJAX: Shall I call you father?
255: NESTOR: Ay, my good son.
256: DIOMEDES: Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax.
257: ULYSSES: There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles
258: Keeps thicket. Please it our great general
259: To call together all his state of war;
260: Fresh kings are come to Troy: to-morrow
261: We must with all our main of power stand fast:
262: And here's a lord,--come knights from east to west,
263: And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.
ACT 3 SCENE 1

1: PANDARUS: Friend, you! pray you, a word: do not you follow
2: the young Lord Paris?
3: Servant: Ay, sir, when he goes before me.
4: PANDARUS: You depend upon him, I mean?
5: Servant: Sir, I do depend upon the lord.
6: PANDARUS: You depend upon a noble gentleman; I must needs
7: praise him.
8: Servant: The lord be praised!
9: PANDARUS: You know me, do you not?
10: Servant: Faith, sir, superficially.
11: PANDARUS: Friend, know me better; I am the Lord Pandarus.
12: Servant: I hope I shall know your honour better.
13: PANDARUS: I do desire it.
14: Servant: You are in the state of grace.
15: PANDARUS: Grace! not so, friend: honour and lordship are my titles.
16: What music is this?
17: Servant: I do but partly know, sir: it is music in parts.
18: PANDARUS: Know you the musicians?
19: Servant: Wholly, sir.
20: PANDARUS: Who play they to?
21: Servant: To the hearers, sir.
22: PANDARUS: At whose pleasure, friend
23: Servant: At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.
24: PANDARUS: Command, I mean, friend.
25: Servant: Who shall I command, sir?
26: PANDARUS: Friend, we understand not one another: I am too
27: courtly and thou art too cunning. At whose request
28: do these men play?
29: Servant: That's to 't indeed, sir: marry, sir, at the request
30: of Paris my lord, who's there in person; with him,
31: the mortal Venus, the heart-blood of beauty, love's
32: invisible soul,--
33: PANDARUS: Who, my cousin Cressida?
34: Servant: No, sir, Helen: could you not find out that by her
35: attributes?
36: PANDARUS: It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the
37: Lady Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the
38: Prince Troilus: I will make a complimental assault
39: upon him, for my business seethes.
40: Servant: Sodden business! there's a stewed phrase indeed!
41: PANDARUS: Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair
42: company! fair desires, in all fair measure,
43: fairly guide them! especially to you, fair queen!
44: fair thoughts be your fair pillow!
45: HELEN: Dear lord, you are full of fair words.
46: PANDARUS: You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair
47: prince, here is good broken music.
48: PARIS: You have broke it, cousin: and, by my life, you
49: shall make it whole again; you shall piece it out
50: with a piece of your performance. Nell, he is full
51: of harmony.
52: PANDARUS: Truly, lady, no.
53: HELEN: O, sir,--
54: PANDARUS: Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.
55: PARIS: Well said, my lord! well, you say so in fits.
56: PANDARUS: I have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord,
57: will you vouchsafe me a word?
58: HELEN: Nay, this shall not hedge us out: we'll hear you
59: sing, certainly.
60: PANDARUS: Well, sweet queen. you are pleasant with me. But,
61: marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and most esteemed
62: friend, your brother Troilus,--
63: HELEN: My Lord Pandarus; honey-sweet lord,--
64: PANDARUS: Go to, sweet queen, to go:--commends himself most
65: affectionately to you,--
66: HELEN: You shall not bob us out of our melody: if you do,
67: our melancholy upon your head!
68: PANDARUS: Sweet queen, sweet queen! that's a sweet queen, i' faith.
69: HELEN: And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.
70: PANDARUS: Nay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall not,
71: in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words; no,
72: no. And, my lord, he desires you, that if the king
73: call for him at supper, you will make his excuse.
74: HELEN: My Lord Pandarus,--
75: PANDARUS: What says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?
76: PARIS: What exploit's in hand? where sups he to-night?
77: HELEN: Nay, but, my lord,--
78: PANDARUS: What says my sweet queen? My cousin will fall out
79: with you. You must not know where he sups.
80: PARIS: I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.
81: PANDARUS: No, no, no such matter; you are wide: come, your
82: disposer is sick.
83: PARIS: Well, I'll make excuse.
84: PANDARUS: Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida? no,
85: your poor disposer's sick.
86: PARIS: I spy.
87: PANDARUS: You spy! what do you spy? Come, give me an
88: instrument. Now, sweet queen.
89: HELEN: Why, this is kindly done.
90: PANDARUS: My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have,
91: sweet queen.
92: HELEN: She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my lord Paris.
93: PANDARUS: He! no, she'll none of him; they two are twain.
94: HELEN: Falling in, after falling out, may make them three.
95: PANDARUS: Come, come, I'll hear no more of this; I'll sing
96: you a song now.
97: HELEN: Ay, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thou
98: hast a fine forehead.
99: PANDARUS: Ay, you may, you may.
100: HELEN: Let thy song be love: this love will undo us all.
101: O Cupid, Cupid, Cupid!
102: PANDARUS: Love! ay, that it shall, i' faith.
103: PARIS: Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.
104: PANDARUS: In good troth, it begins so.
105: Love, love, nothing but love, still more!
106: For, O, love's bow
107: Shoots buck and doe:
108: The shaft confounds,
109: Not that it wounds,
110: But tickles still the sore.
111: These lovers cry Oh! oh! they die!
112: Yet that which seems the wound to kill,
113: Doth turn oh! oh! to ha! ha! he!
114: So dying love lives still:
115: Oh! oh! a while, but ha! ha! ha!
116: Oh! oh! groans out for ha! ha! ha!
117: Heigh-ho!
118: HELEN: In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.
119: PARIS: He eats nothing but doves, love, and that breeds hot
120: blood, and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot
121: thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love.
122: PANDARUS: Is this the generation of love? hot blood, hot
123: thoughts, and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers:
124: is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who's
125: a-field to-day?
126: PARIS: Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the
127: gallantry of Troy: I would fain have armed to-day,
128: but my Nell would not have it so. How chance my
129: brother Troilus went not?
130: HELEN: He hangs the lip at something: you know all, Lord Pandarus.
131: PANDARUS: Not I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how they
132: sped to-day. You'll remember your brother's excuse?
133: PARIS: To a hair.
134: PANDARUS: Farewell, sweet queen.
135: HELEN: Commend me to your niece.
136: PANDARUS: I will, sweet queen.
137: PARIS: They're come from field: let us to Priam's hall,
138: To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you
139: To help unarm our Hector: his stubborn buckles,
140: With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,
141: Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
142: Or force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more
143: Than all the island kings,--disarm great Hector.
144: HELEN: 'Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris;
145: Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty
146: Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,
147: Yea, overshines ourself.
148: PARIS: Sweet, above thought I love thee.
ACT 3 SCENE 2

1: PANDARUS: How now! where's thy master? at my cousin
2: Cressida's?
3: Boy: No, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.
4: PANDARUS: O, here he comes.
5: How now, how now!
6: TROILUS: Sirrah, walk off.
7: PANDARUS: Have you seen my cousin?
8: TROILUS: No, Pandarus: I stalk about her door,
9: Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks
10: Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,
11: And give me swift transportance to those fields
12: Where I may wallow in the lily-beds
13: Proposed for the deserver! O gentle Pandarus,
14: From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings
15: And fly with me to Cressid!
16: PANDARUS: Walk here i' the orchard, I'll bring her straight.
17: TROILUS: I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.
18: The imaginary relish is so sweet
19: That it enchants my sense: what will it be,
20: When that the watery palate tastes indeed
21: Love's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me,
22: Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,
23: Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness,
24: For the capacity of my ruder powers:
25: I fear it much; and I do fear besides,
26: That I shall lose distinction in my joys;
27: As doth a battle, when they charge on heaps
28: The enemy flying.
29: PANDARUS: She's making her ready, she'll come straight: you
30: must be witty now. She does so blush, and fetches
31: her wind so short, as if she were frayed with a
32: sprite: I'll fetch her. It is the prettiest
33: villain: she fetches her breath as short as a
34: new-ta'en sparrow.
35: TROILUS: Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom:
36: My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse;
37: And all my powers do their bestowing lose,
38: Like vassalage at unawares encountering
39: The eye of majesty.
40: PANDARUS: Come, come, what need you blush? shame's a baby.
41: Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her that
42: you have sworn to me. What, are you gone again?
43: you must be watched ere you be made tame, must you?
44: Come your ways, come your ways; an you draw backward,
45: we'll put you i' the fills. Why do you not speak to
46: her? Come, draw this curtain, and let's see your
47: picture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offend
48: daylight! an 'twere dark, you'ld close sooner.
49: So, so; rub on, and kiss the mistress. How now!
50: a kiss in fee-farm! build there, carpenter; the air
51: is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere
52: I part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all the
53: ducks i' the river: go to, go to.
54: TROILUS: You have bereft me of all words, lady.
55: PANDARUS: Words pay no debts, give her deeds: but she'll
56: bereave you o' the deeds too, if she call your
57: activity in question. What, billing again? Here's
58: 'In witness whereof the parties interchangeably'--
59: Come in, come in: I'll go get a fire.
60: CRESSIDA: Will you walk in, my lord?
61: TROILUS: O Cressida, how often have I wished me thus!
62: CRESSIDA: Wished, my lord! The gods grant,--O my lord!
63: TROILUS: What should they grant? what makes this pretty
64: abruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweet
65: lady in the fountain of our love?
66: CRESSIDA: More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.
67: TROILUS: Fears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.
68: CRESSIDA: Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer
69: footing than blind reason stumbling without fear: to
70: fear the worst oft cures the worse.
71: TROILUS: O, let my lady apprehend no fear: in all Cupid's
72: pageant there is presented no monster.
73: CRESSIDA: Nor nothing monstrous neither?
74: TROILUS: Nothing, but our undertakings; when we vow to weep
75: seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers; thinking
76: it harder for our mistress to devise imposition
77: enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.
78: This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will
79: is infinite and the execution confined, that the
80: desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.
81: CRESSIDA: They say all lovers swear more performance than they
82: are able and yet reserve an ability that they never
83: perform, vowing more than the perfection of ten and
84: discharging less than the tenth part of one. They
85: that have the voice of lions and the act of hares,
86: are they not monsters?
87: TROILUS: Are there such? such are not we: praise us as we
88: are tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall go
89: bare till merit crown it: no perfection in reversion
90: shall have a praise in present: we will not name
91: desert before his birth, and, being born, his addition
92: shall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilus
93: shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst
94: shall be a mock for his truth, and what truth can
95: speak truest not truer than Troilus.
96: CRESSIDA: Will you walk in, my lord?
97: PANDARUS: What, blushing still? have you not done talking yet?
98: CRESSIDA: Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.
99: PANDARUS: I thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,
100: you'll give him me. Be true to my lord: if he
101: flinch, chide me for it.
102: TROILUS: You know now your hostages; your uncle's word and my
103: firm faith.
104: PANDARUS: Nay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred,
105: though they be long ere they are wooed, they are
106: constant being won: they are burs, I can tell you;
107: they'll stick where they are thrown.
108: CRESSIDA: Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart.
109: Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day
110: For many weary months.
111: TROILUS: Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?
112: CRESSIDA: Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,
113: With the first glance that ever--pardon me--
114: If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.
115: I love you now; but not, till now, so much
116: But I might master it: in faith, I lie;
117: My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown
118: Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
119: Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,
120: When we are so unsecret to ourselves?
121: But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not;
122: And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,
123: Or that we women had men's privilege
124: Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,
125: For in this rapture I shall surely speak
126: The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,
127: Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws
128: My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.
129: TROILUS: And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.
130: PANDARUS: Pretty, i' faith.
131: CRESSIDA: My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;
132: 'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss:
133: I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?
134: For this time will I take my leave, my lord.
135: TROILUS: Your leave, sweet Cressid!
136: PANDARUS: Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning,--
137: CRESSIDA: Pray you, content you.
138: TROILUS: What offends you, lady?
139: CRESSIDA: Sir, mine own company.
140: TROILUS: You cannot shun Yourself.
141: CRESSIDA: Let me go and try:
142: I have a kind of self resides with you;
143: But an unkind self, that itself will leave,
144: To be another's fool. I would be gone:
145: Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.
146: TROILUS: Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.
147: CRESSIDA: Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;
148: And fell so roundly to a large confession,
149: To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,
150: Or else you love not, for to be wise and love
151: Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
152: TROILUS: O that I thought it could be in a woman--
153: As, if it can, I will presume in you--
154: To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love;
155: To keep her constancy in plight and youth,
156: Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind
157: That doth renew swifter than blood decays!
158: Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,
159: That my integrity and truth to you
160: Might be affronted with the match and weight
161: Of such a winnow'd purity in love;
162: How were I then uplifted! but, alas!
163: I am as true as truth's simplicity
164: And simpler than the infancy of truth.
165: CRESSIDA: In that I'll war with you.
166: TROILUS: O virtuous fight,
167: When right with right wars who shall be most right!
168: True swains in love shall in the world to come
169: Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,
170: Full of protest, of oath and big compare,
171: Want similes, truth tired with iteration,
172: As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,
173: As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,
174: As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,
175: Yet, after all comparisons of truth,
176: As truth's authentic author to be cited,
177: 'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,
178: And sanctify the numbers.
179: CRESSIDA: Prophet may you be!
180: If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,
181: When time is old and hath forgot itself,
182: When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,
183: And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,
184: And mighty states characterless are grated
185: To dusty nothing, yet let memory,
186: From false to false, among false maids in love,
187: Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false
188: As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,
189: As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf,
190: Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,'
191: 'Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,
192: 'As false as Cressid.'
193: PANDARUS: Go to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it; I'll be the
194: witness. Here I hold your hand, here my cousin's.
195: If ever you prove false one to another, since I have
196: taken such pains to bring you together, let all
197: pitiful goers-between be called to the world's end
198: after my name; call them all Pandars; let all
199: constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,
200: and all brokers-between Pandars! say, amen.
201: TROILUS: Amen.
202: CRESSIDA: Amen.
203: PANDARUS: Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with a
204: bed; which bed, because it shall not speak of your
205: pretty encounters, press it to death: away!
206: And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here
207: Bed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!
ACT 3 SCENE 3

1: CALCHAS: Now, princes, for the service I have done you,
2: The advantage of the time prompts me aloud
3: To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind
4: That, through the sight I bear in things to love,
5: I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,
6: Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,
7: From certain and possess'd conveniences,
8: To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all
9: That time, acquaintance, custom and condition
10: Made tame and most familiar to my nature,
11: And here, to do you service, am become
12: As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:
13: I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
14: To give me now a little benefit,
15: Out of those many register'd in promise,
16: Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.
17: AGAMEMNON: What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.
18: CALCHAS: You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,
19: Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.
20: Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--
21: Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,
22: Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,
23: I know, is such a wrest in their affairs
24: That their negotiations all must slack,
25: Wanting his manage; and they will almost
26: Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,
27: In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,
28: And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence
29: Shall quite strike off all service I have done,
30: In most accepted pain.
31: AGAMEMNON: Let Diomedes bear him,
32: And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have
33: What he requests of us. Good Diomed,
34: Furnish you fairly for this interchange:
35: Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow
36: Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.
37: DIOMEDES: This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden
38: Which I am proud to bear.
39: ULYSSES: Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:
40: Please it our general to pass strangely by him,
41: As if he were forgot; and, princes all,
42: Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:
43: I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me
44: Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:
45: If so, I have derision medicinable,
46: To use between your strangeness and his pride,
47: Which his own will shall have desire to drink:
48: It may be good: pride hath no other glass
49: To show itself but pride, for supple knees
50: Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.
51: AGAMEMNON: We'll execute your purpose, and put on
52: A form of strangeness as we pass along:
53: So do each lord, and either greet him not,
54: Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more
55: Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.
56: ACHILLES: What, comes the general to speak with me?
57: You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.
58: AGAMEMNON: What says Achilles? would he aught with us?
59: NESTOR: Would you, my lord, aught with the general?
60: ACHILLES: No.
61: NESTOR: Nothing, my lord.
62: AGAMEMNON: The better.
63: ACHILLES: Good day, good day.
64: MENELAUS: How do you? how do you?
65: ACHILLES: What, does the cuckold scorn me?
66: AJAX: How now, Patroclus!
67: ACHILLES: Good morrow, Ajax.
68: AJAX: Ha?
69: ACHILLES: Good morrow.
70: AJAX: Ay, and good next day too.
71: ACHILLES: What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?
72: PATROCLUS: They pass by strangely: they were used to bend
73: To send their smiles before them to Achilles;
74: To come as humbly as they used to creep
75: To holy altars.
76: ACHILLES: What, am I poor of late?
77: 'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,
78: Must fall out with men too: what the declined is
79: He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
80: As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,
81: Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,
82: And not a man, for being simply man,
83: Hath any honour, but honour for those honours
84: That are without him, as place, riches, favour,
85: Prizes of accident as oft as merit:
86: Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,
87: The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,
88: Do one pluck down another and together
89: Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:
90: Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy
91: At ample point all that I did possess,
92: Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out
93: Something not worth in me such rich beholding
94: As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;
95: I'll interrupt his reading.
96: How now Ulysses!
97: ULYSSES: Now, great Thetis' son!
98: ACHILLES: What are you reading?
99: ULYSSES: A strange fellow here
100: Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,
101: How much in having, or without or in,
102: Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,
103: Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;
104: As when his virtues shining upon others
105: Heat them and they retort that heat again
106: To the first giver.'
107: ACHILLES: This is not strange, Ulysses.
108: The beauty that is borne here in the face
109: The bearer knows not, but commends itself
110: To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,
111: That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,
112: Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed
113: Salutes each other with each other's form;
114: For speculation turns not to itself,
115: Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there
116: Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.
117: ULYSSES: I do not strain at the position,--
118: It is familiar,--but at the author's drift;
119: Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves
120: That no man is the lord of any thing,
121: Though in and of him there be much consisting,
122: Till he communicate his parts to others:
123: Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
124: Till he behold them form'd in the applause
125: Where they're extended; who, like an arch,
126: reverberates
127: The voice again, or, like a gate of steel
128: Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
129: His figure and his heat. I was much wrapt in this;
130: And apprehended here immediately
131: The unknown Ajax.
132: Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,
133: That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are
134: Most abject in regard and dear in use!
135: What things again most dear in the esteem
136: And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--
137: An act that very chance doth throw upon him--
138: Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,
139: While some men leave to do!
140: How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,
141: Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!
142: How one man eats into another's pride,
143: While pride is fasting in his wantonness!
144: To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already
145: They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,
146: As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast
147: And great Troy shrieking.
148: ACHILLES: I do believe it; for they pass'd by me
149: As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me
150: Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?
151: ULYSSES: Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
152: Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
153: A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:
154: Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd
155: As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
156: As done: perseverance, dear my lord,
157: Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
158: Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail
159: In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;
160: For honour travels in a strait so narrow,
161: Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;
162: For emulation hath a thousand sons
163: That one by one pursue: if you give way,
164: Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,
165: Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by
166: And leave you hindmost;
167: Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
168: Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
169: O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,
170: Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;
171: For time is like a fashionable host
172: That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,
173: And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,
174: Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,
175: And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not
176: virtue seek
177: Remuneration for the thing it was;
178: For beauty, wit,
179: High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,
180: Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all
181: To envious and calumniating time.
182: One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,
183: That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,
184: Though they are made and moulded of things past,
185: And give to dust that is a little gilt
186: More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.
187: The present eye praises the present object.
188: Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,
189: That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;
190: Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
191: Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,
192: And still it might, and yet it may again,
193: If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
194: And case thy reputation in thy tent;
195: Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,
196: Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves
197: And drave great Mars to faction.
198: ACHILLES: Of this my privacy
199: I have strong reasons.
200: ULYSSES: But 'gainst your privacy
201: The reasons are more potent and heroical:
202: 'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
203: With one of Priam's daughters.
204: ACHILLES: Ha! known!
205: ULYSSES: Is that a wonder?
206: The providence that's in a watchful state
207: Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,
208: Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,
209: Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,
210: Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.
211: There is a mystery--with whom relation
212: Durst never meddle--in the soul of state;
213: Which hath an operation more divine
214: Than breath or pen can give expressure to:
215: All the commerce that you have had with Troy
216: As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;
217: And better would it fit Achilles much
218: To throw down Hector than Polyxena:
219: But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,
220: When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,
221: And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,
222: 'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,
223: But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'
224: Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;
225: The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.
226: PATROCLUS: To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:
227: A woman impudent and mannish grown
228: Is not more loathed than an effeminate man
229: In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;
230: They think my little stomach to the war
231: And your great love to me restrains you thus:
232: Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid
233: Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,
234: And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,
235: Be shook to air.
236: ACHILLES: Shall Ajax fight with Hector?
237: PATROCLUS: Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.
238: ACHILLES: I see my reputation is at stake
239: My fame is shrewdly gored.
240: PATROCLUS: O, then, beware;
241: Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:
242: Omission to do what is necessary
243: Seals a commission to a blank of danger;
244: And danger, like an ague, subtly taints
245: Even then when we sit idly in the sun.
246: ACHILLES: Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:
247: I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him
248: To invite the Trojan lords after the combat
249: To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,
250: An appetite that I am sick withal,
251: To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,
252: To talk with him and to behold his visage,
253: Even to my full of view.
254: A labour saved!
255: THERSITES: A wonder!
256: ACHILLES: What?
257: THERSITES: Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.
258: ACHILLES: How so?
259: THERSITES: He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so
260: prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
261: raves in saying nothing.
262: ACHILLES: How can that be?
263: THERSITES: Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a stride
264: and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no
265: arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:
266: bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should
267: say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;'
268: and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire
269: in a flint, which will not show without knocking.
270: The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his
271: neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in
272: vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,
273: Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think
274: you of this man that takes me for the general? He's
275: grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.
276: A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both
277: sides, like a leather jerkin.
278: ACHILLES: Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.
279: THERSITES: Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not
280: answering: speaking is for beggars; he wears his
281: tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: let
282: Patroclus make demands to me, you shall see the
283: pageant of Ajax.
284: ACHILLES: To him, Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire the
285: valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector
286: to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure
287: safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous
288: and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured
289: captain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,
290: et cetera. Do this.
291: PATROCLUS: Jove bless great Ajax!
292: THERSITES: Hum!
293: PATROCLUS: I come from the worthy Achilles,--
294: THERSITES: Ha!
295: PATROCLUS: Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,--
296: THERSITES: Hum!
297: PATROCLUS: And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.
298: THERSITES: Agamemnon!
299: PATROCLUS: Ay, my lord.
300: THERSITES: Ha!
301: PATROCLUS: What say you to't?
302: THERSITES: God b' wi' you, with all my heart.
303: PATROCLUS: Your answer, sir.
304: THERSITES: If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock it will
305: go one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay for me
306: ere he has me.
307: PATROCLUS: Your answer, sir.
308: THERSITES: Fare you well, with all my heart.
309: ACHILLES: Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?
310: THERSITES: No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be in
311: him when Hector has knocked out his brains, I know
312: not; but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apollo
313: get his sinews to make catlings on.
314: ACHILLES: Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.
315: THERSITES: Let me bear another to his horse; for that's the more
316: capable creature.
317: ACHILLES: My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd;
318: And I myself see not the bottom of it.
ACT 4 SCENE 1

1: PARIS: See, ho! who is that there?
2: DEIPHOBUS: It is the Lord AEneas.
3: AENEAS: Is the prince there in person?
4: Had I so good occasion to lie long
5: As you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business
6: Should rob my bed-mate of my company.
7: DIOMEDES: That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas.
8: PARIS: A valiant Greek, AEneas,--take his hand,--
9: Witness the process of your speech, wherein
10: You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
11: Did haunt you in the field.
12: AENEAS: Health to you, valiant sir,
13: During all question of the gentle truce;
14: But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance
15: As heart can think or courage execute.
16: DIOMEDES: The one and other Diomed embraces.
17: Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health!
18: But when contention and occasion meet,
19: By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life
20: With all my force, pursuit and policy.
21: AENEAS: And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly
22: With his face backward. In humane gentleness,
23: Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,
24: Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,
25: No man alive can love in such a sort
26: The thing he means to kill more excellently.
27: DIOMEDES: We sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live,
28: If to my sword his fate be not the glory,
29: A thousand complete courses of the sun!
30: But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,
31: With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!
32: AENEAS: We know each other well.
33: DIOMEDES: We do; and long to know each other worse.
34: PARIS: This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,
35: The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.
36: What business, lord, so early?
37: AENEAS: I was sent for to the king; but why, I know not.
38: PARIS: His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek
39: To Calchas' house, and there to render him,
40: For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:
41: Let's have your company, or, if you please,
42: Haste there before us: I constantly do think--
43: Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge--
44: My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:
45: Rouse him and give him note of our approach.
46: With the whole quality wherefore: I fear
47: We shall be much unwelcome.
48: AENEAS: That I assure you:
49: Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
50: Than Cressid borne from Troy.
51: PARIS: There is no help;
52: The bitter disposition of the time
53: Will have it so. On, lord; we'll follow you.
54: AENEAS: Good morrow, all.
55: PARIS: And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,
56: Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,
57: Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,
58: Myself or Menelaus?
59: DIOMEDES: Both alike:
60: He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,
61: Not making any scruple of her soilure,
62: With such a hell of pain and world of charge,
63: And you as well to keep her, that defend her,
64: Not palating the taste of her dishonour,
65: With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:
66: He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up
67: The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;
68: You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins
69: Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:
70: Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;
71: But he as he, the heavier for a whore.
72: PARIS: You are too bitter to your countrywoman.
73: DIOMEDES: She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:
74: For every false drop in her bawdy veins
75: A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple
76: Of her contaminated carrion weight,
77: A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,
78: She hath not given so many good words breath
79: As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.
80: PARIS: Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,
81: Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:
82: But we in silence hold this virtue well,
83: We'll but commend what we intend to sell.
84: Here lies our way.
ACT 4 SCENE 2

1: TROILUS: Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.
2: CRESSIDA: Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down;
3: He shall unbolt the gates.
4: TROILUS: Trouble him not;
5: To bed, to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes,
6: And give as soft attachment to thy senses
7: As infants' empty of all thought!
8: CRESSIDA: Good morrow, then.
9: TROILUS: I prithee now, to bed.
10: CRESSIDA: Are you a-weary of me?
11: TROILUS: O Cressida! but that the busy day,
12: Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,
13: And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,
14: I would not from thee.
15: CRESSIDA: Night hath been too brief.
16: TROILUS: Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays
17: As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love
18: With wings more momentary-swift than thought.
19: You will catch cold, and curse me.
20: CRESSIDA: Prithee, tarry:
21: You men will never tarry.
22: O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,
23: And then you would have tarried. Hark!
24: there's one up.
25: PANDARUS: [Within] What, 's all the doors open here?
26: TROILUS: It is your uncle.
27: CRESSIDA: A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:
28: I shall have such a life!
29: PANDARUS: How now, how now! how go maidenheads? Here, you
30: maid! where's my cousin Cressid?
31: CRESSIDA: Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!
32: You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.
33: PANDARUS: To do what? to do what? let her say
34: what: what have I brought you to do?
35: CRESSIDA: Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,
36: Nor suffer others.
37: PANDARUS: Ha! ha! Alas, poor wretch! ah, poor capocchia!
38: hast not slept to-night? would he not, a naughty
39: man, let it sleep? a bugbear take him!
40: CRESSIDA: Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' the head!
41: Who's that at door? good uncle, go and see.
42: My lord, come you again into my chamber:
43: You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.
44: TROILUS: Ha, ha!
45: CRESSIDA: Come, you are deceived, I think of no such thing.
46: How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in:
47: I would not for half Troy have you seen here.
48: PANDARUS: Who's there? what's the matter? will you beat
49: down the door? How now! what's the matter?
50: AENEAS: Good morrow, lord, good morrow.
51: PANDARUS: Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,
52: I knew you not: what news with you so early?
53: AENEAS: Is not Prince Troilus here?
54: PANDARUS: Here! what should he do here?
55: AENEAS: Come, he is here, my lord; do not deny him:
56: It doth import him much to speak with me.
57: PANDARUS: Is he here, say you? 'tis more than I know, I'll
58: be sworn: for my own part, I came in late. What
59: should he do here?
60: AENEAS: Who!--nay, then: come, come, you'll do him wrong
61: ere you're ware: you'll be so true to him, to be
62: false to him: do not you know of him, but yet go
63: fetch him hither; go.
64: TROILUS: How now! what's the matter?
65: AENEAS: My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,
66: My matter is so rash: there is at hand
67: Paris your brother, and Deiphobus,
68: The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor
69: Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,
70: Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,
71: We must give up to Diomedes' hand
72: The Lady Cressida.
73: TROILUS: Is it so concluded?
74: AENEAS: By Priam and the general state of Troy:
75: They are at hand and ready to effect it.
76: TROILUS: How my achievements mock me!
77: I will go meet them: and, my Lord AEneas,
78: We met by chance; you did not find me here.
79: AENEAS: Good, good, my lord; the secrets of nature
80: Have not more gift in taciturnity.
81: PANDARUS: Is't possible? no sooner got but lost? The devil
82: take Antenor! the young prince will go mad: a
83: plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke 's neck!
84: CRESSIDA: How now! what's the matter? who was here?
85: PANDARUS: Ah, ah!
86: CRESSIDA: Why sigh you so profoundly? where's my lord? gone!
87: Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?
88: PANDARUS: Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!
89: CRESSIDA: O the gods! what's the matter?
90: PANDARUS: Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been
91: born! I knew thou wouldst be his death. O, poor
92: gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!
93: CRESSIDA: Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees! beseech you,
94: what's the matter?
95: PANDARUS: Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thou
96: art changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father,
97: and be gone from Troilus: 'twill be his death;
98: 'twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.
99: CRESSIDA: O you immortal gods! I will not go.
100: PANDARUS: Thou must.
101: CRESSIDA: I will not, uncle: I have forgot my father;
102: I know no touch of consanguinity;
103: No kin no love, no blood, no soul so near me
104: As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!
105: Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,
106: If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,
107: Do to this body what extremes you can;
108: But the strong base and building of my love
109: Is as the very centre of the earth,
110: Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep,--
111: PANDARUS: Do, do.
112: CRESSIDA: Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,
113: Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart
114: With sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.
ACT 4 SCENE 3

1: PARIS: It is great morning, and the hour prefix'd
2: Of her delivery to this valiant Greek
3: Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,
4: Tell you the lady what she is to do,
5: And haste her to the purpose.
6: TROILUS: Walk into her house;
7: I'll bring her to the Grecian presently:
8: And to his hand when I deliver her,
9: Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus
10: A priest there offering to it his own heart.
11: PARIS: I know what 'tis to love;
12: And would, as I shall pity, I could help!
13: Please you walk in, my lords.
ACT 4 SCENE 4

1: PANDARUS: Be moderate, be moderate.
2: CRESSIDA: Why tell you me of moderation?
3: The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,
4: And violenteth in a sense as strong
5: As that which causeth it: how can I moderate it?
6: If I could temporize with my affection,
7: Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,
8: The like allayment could I give my grief.
9: My love admits no qualifying dross;
10: No more my grief, in such a precious loss.
11: PANDARUS: Here, here, here he comes.
12: Ah, sweet ducks!
13: CRESSIDA: O Troilus! Troilus!
14: PANDARUS: What a pair of spectacles is here!
15: Let me embrace too. 'O heart,' as the goodly saying is,
16: '--O heart, heavy heart,
17: Why sigh'st thou without breaking?
18: where he answers again,
19: 'Because thou canst not ease thy smart
20: By friendship nor by speaking.'
21: There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away
22: nothing, for we may live to have need of such a
23: verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?
24: TROILUS: Cressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity,
25: That the bless'd gods, as angry with my fancy,
26: More bright in zeal than the devotion which
27: Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.
28: CRESSIDA: Have the gods envy?
29: PANDARUS: Ay, ay, ay, ay; 'tis too plain a case.
30: CRESSIDA: And is it true that I must go from Troy?
31: TROILUS: A hateful truth.
32: CRESSIDA: What, and from Troilus too?
33: TROILUS: From Troy and Troilus.
34: CRESSIDA: Is it possible?
35: TROILUS: And suddenly; where injury of chance
36: Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by
37: All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips
38: Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents
39: Our lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vows
40: Even in the birth of our own labouring breath:
41: We two, that with so many thousand sighs
42: Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves
43: With the rude brevity and discharge of one.
44: Injurious time now with a robber's haste
45: Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how:
46: As many farewells as be stars in heaven,
47: With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,
48: He fumbles up into a lose adieu,
49: And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,
50: Distasted with the salt of broken tears.
51: AENEAS: [Within] My lord, is the lady ready?
52: TROILUS: Hark! you are call'd: some say the Genius so
53: Cries 'come' to him that instantly must die.
54: Bid them have patience; she shall come anon.
55: PANDARUS: Where are my tears? rain, to lay this wind, or
56: my heart will be blown up by the root.
57: CRESSIDA: I must then to the Grecians?
58: TROILUS: No remedy.
59: CRESSIDA: A woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!
60: When shall we see again?
61: TROILUS: Hear me, my love: be thou but true of heart,--
62: CRESSIDA: I true! how now! what wicked deem is this?
63: TROILUS: Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,
64: For it is parting from us:
65: I speak not 'be thou true,' as fearing thee,
66: For I will throw my glove to Death himself,
67: That there's no maculation in thy heart:
68: But 'be thou true,' say I, to fashion in
69: My sequent protestation; be thou true,
70: And I will see thee.
71: CRESSIDA: O, you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangers
72: As infinite as imminent! but I'll be true.
73: TROILUS: And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.
74: CRESSIDA: And you this glove. When shall I see you?
75: TROILUS: I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,
76: To give thee nightly visitation.
77: But yet be true.
78: CRESSIDA: O heavens! 'be true' again!
79: TROILUS: Hear while I speak it, love:
80: The Grecian youths are full of quality;
81: They're loving, well composed with gifts of nature,
82: Flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise:
83: How novelty may move, and parts with person,
84: Alas, a kind of godly jealousy--
85: Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin--
86: Makes me afeard.
87: CRESSIDA: O heavens! you love me not.
88: TROILUS: Die I a villain, then!
89: In this I do not call your faith in question
90: So mainly as my merit: I cannot sing,
91: Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,
92: Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,
93: To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant:
94: But I can tell that in each grace of these
95: There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil
96: That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.
97: CRESSIDA: Do you think I will?
98: TROILUS: No.
99: But something may be done that we will not:
100: And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,
101: When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,
102: Presuming on their changeful potency.
103: AENEAS: [Within] Nay, good my lord,--
104: TROILUS: Come, kiss; and let us part.
105: PARIS: [Within] Brother Troilus!
106: TROILUS: Good brother, come you hither;
107: And bring AEneas and the Grecian with you.
108: CRESSIDA: My lord, will you be true?
109: TROILUS: Who, I? alas, it is my vice, my fault:
110: Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,
111: I with great truth catch mere simplicity;
112: Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,
113: With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.
114: Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit
115: Is 'plain and true;' there's all the reach of it.
116: Welcome, Sir Diomed! here is the lady
117: Which for Antenor we deliver you:
118: At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand,
119: And by the way possess thee what she is.
120: Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
121: If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,
122: Name Cressida and thy life shall be as safe
123: As Priam is in Ilion.
124: DIOMEDES: Fair Lady Cressid,
125: So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:
126: The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,
127: Pleads your fair usage; and to Diomed
128: You shall be mistress, and command him wholly.
129: TROILUS: Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,
130: To shame the zeal of my petition to thee
131: In praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece,
132: She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises
133: As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.
134: I charge thee use her well, even for my charge;
135: For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,
136: Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,
137: I'll cut thy throat.
138: DIOMEDES: O, be not moved, Prince Troilus:
139: Let me be privileged by my place and message,
140: To be a speaker free; when I am hence
141: I'll answer to my lust: and know you, lord,
142: I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
143: She shall be prized; but that you say 'be't so,'
144: I'll speak it in my spirit and honour, 'no.'
145: TROILUS: Come, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed,
146: This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.
147: Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,
148: To our own selves bend we our needful talk.
149: PARIS: Hark! Hector's trumpet.
150: AENEAS: How have we spent this morning!
151: The prince must think me tardy and remiss,
152: That sore to ride before him to the field.
153: PARIS: 'Tis Troilus' fault: come, come, to field with him.
154: DEIPHOBUS: Let us make ready straight.
155: AENEAS: Yea, with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity,
156: Let us address to tend on Hector's heels:
157: The glory of our Troy doth this day lie
158: On his fair worth and single chivalry.
ACT 4 SCENE 5

1: AGAMEMNON: Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,
2: Anticipating time with starting courage.
3: Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,
4: Thou dreadful Ajax; that the appalled air
5: May pierce the head of the great combatant
6: And hale him hither.
7: AJAX: Thou, trumpet, there's my purse.
8: Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:
9: Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek
10: Outswell the colic of puff'd Aquilon:
11: Come, stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood;
12: Thou blow'st for Hector.
13: ULYSSES: No trumpet answers.
14: ACHILLES: 'Tis but early days.
15: AGAMEMNON: Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?
16: ULYSSES: 'Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait;
17: He rises on the toe: that spirit of his
18: In aspiration lifts him from the earth.
19: AGAMEMNON: Is this the Lady Cressid?
20: DIOMEDES: Even she.
21: AGAMEMNON: Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.
22: NESTOR: Our general doth salute you with a kiss.
23: ULYSSES: Yet is the kindness but particular;
24: 'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.
25: NESTOR: And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.
26: So much for Nestor.
27: ACHILLES: I'll take what winter from your lips, fair lady:
28: Achilles bids you welcome.
29: MENELAUS: I had good argument for kissing once.
30: PATROCLUS: But that's no argument for kissing now;
31: For this popp'd Paris in his hardiment,
32: And parted thus you and your argument.
33: ULYSSES: O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!
34: For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.
35: PATROCLUS: The first was Menelaus' kiss; this, mine:
36: Patroclus kisses you.
37: MENELAUS: O, this is trim!
38: PATROCLUS: Paris and I kiss evermore for him.
39: MENELAUS: I'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave.
40: CRESSIDA: In kissing, do you render or receive?
41: PATROCLUS: Both take and give.
42: CRESSIDA: I'll make my match to live,
43: The kiss you take is better than you give;
44: Therefore no kiss.
45: MENELAUS: I'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one.
46: CRESSIDA: You're an odd man; give even or give none.
47: MENELAUS: An odd man, lady! every man is odd.
48: CRESSIDA: No, Paris is not; for you know 'tis true,
49: That you are odd, and he is even with you.
50: MENELAUS: You fillip me o' the head.
51: CRESSIDA: No, I'll be sworn.
52: ULYSSES: It were no match, your nail against his horn.
53: May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?
54: CRESSIDA: You may.
55: ULYSSES: I do desire it.
56: CRESSIDA: Why, beg, then.
57: ULYSSES: Why then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,
58: When Helen is a maid again, and his.
59: CRESSIDA: I am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due.
60: ULYSSES: Never's my day, and then a kiss of you.
61: DIOMEDES: Lady, a word: I'll bring you to your father.
62: NESTOR: A woman of quick sense.
63: ULYSSES: Fie, fie upon her!
64: There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,
65: Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out
66: At every joint and motive of her body.
67: O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,
68: That give accosting welcome ere it comes,
69: And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
70: To every ticklish reader! set them down
71: For sluttish spoils of opportunity
72: And daughters of the game.
73: ALL: The Trojans' trumpet.
74: AGAMEMNON: Yonder comes the troop.
75: AENEAS: Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done
76: To him that victory commands? or do you purpose
77: A victor shall be known? will you the knights
78: Shall to the edge of all extremity
79: Pursue each other, or shall be divided
80: By any voice or order of the field?
81: Hector bade ask.
82: AGAMEMNON: Which way would Hector have it?
83: AENEAS: He cares not; he'll obey conditions.
84: ACHILLES: 'Tis done like Hector; but securely done,
85: A little proudly, and great deal misprizing
86: The knight opposed.
87: AENEAS: If not Achilles, sir,
88: What is your name?
89: ACHILLES: If not Achilles, nothing.
90: AENEAS: Therefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this:
91: In the extremity of great and little,
92: Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector;
93: The one almost as infinite as all,
94: The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,
95: And that which looks like pride is courtesy.
96: This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:
97: In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;
98: Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek
99: This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.
100: ACHILLES: A maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you.
101: AGAMEMNON: Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,
102: Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneas
103: Consent upon the order of their fight,
104: So be it; either to the uttermost,
105: Or else a breath: the combatants being kin
106: Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.
107: ULYSSES: They are opposed already.
108: AGAMEMNON: What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?
109: ULYSSES: The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,
110: Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,
111: Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;
112: Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:
113: His heart and hand both open and both free;
114: For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;
115: Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,
116: Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;
117: Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;
118: For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
119: To tender objects, but he in heat of action
120: Is more vindicative than jealous love:
121: They call him Troilus, and on him erect
122: A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.
123: Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youth
124: Even to his inches, and with private soul
125: Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.
126: AGAMEMNON: They are in action.
127: NESTOR: Now, Ajax, hold thine own!
128: TROILUS: Hector, thou sleep'st;
129: Awake thee!
130: AGAMEMNON: His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax!
131: DIOMEDES: You must no more.
132: AENEAS: Princes, enough, so please you.
133: AJAX: I am not warm yet; let us fight again.
134: DIOMEDES: As Hector pleases.
135: HECTOR: Why, then will I no more:
136: Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,
137: A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;
138: The obligation of our blood forbids
139: A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
140: Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so
141: That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,
142: And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg
143: All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood
144: Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister
145: Bounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent,
146: Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
147: Wherein my sword had not impressure made
148: Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay
149: That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,
150: My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
151: Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:
152: By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;
153: Hector would have them fall upon him thus:
154: Cousin, all honour to thee!
155: AJAX: I thank thee, Hector
156: Thou art too gentle and too free a man:
157: I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
158: A great addition earned in thy death.
159: HECTOR: Not Neoptolemus so mirable,
160: On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes
161: Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself
162: A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
163: AENEAS: There is expectance here from both the sides,
164: What further you will do.
165: HECTOR: We'll answer it;
166: The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell.
167: AJAX: If I might in entreaties find success--
168: As seld I have the chance--I would desire
169: My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.
170: DIOMEDES: 'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great Achilles
171: Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.
172: HECTOR: AEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,
173: And signify this loving interview
174: To the expecters of our Trojan part;
175: Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;
176: I will go eat with thee and see your knights.
177: AJAX: Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.
178: HECTOR: The worthiest of them tell me name by name;
179: But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes
180: Shall find him by his large and portly size.
181: AGAMEMNON: Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one
182: That would be rid of such an enemy;
183: But that's no welcome: understand more clear,
184: What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
185: And formless ruin of oblivion;
186: But in this extant moment, faith and troth,
187: Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,
188: Bids thee, with most divine integrity,
189: From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.
190: HECTOR: I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.
191: AGAMEMNON: [To TROILUS] My well-famed lord of Troy, no
192: less to you.
193: MENELAUS: Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting:
194: You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.
195: HECTOR: Who must we answer?
196: AENEAS: The noble Menelaus.
197: HECTOR: O, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!
198: Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath;
199: Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:
200: She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.
201: MENELAUS: Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
202: HECTOR: O, pardon; I offend.
203: NESTOR: I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft
204: Labouring for destiny make cruel way
205: Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,
206: As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,
207: Despising many forfeits and subduements,
208: When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,
209: Not letting it decline on the declined,
210: That I have said to some my standers by
211: 'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'
212: And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,
213: When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,
214: Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;
215: But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,
216: I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,
217: And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;
218: But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,
219: Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee;
220: And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.
221: AENEAS: 'Tis the old Nestor.
222: HECTOR: Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,
223: That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:
224: Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.
225: NESTOR: I would my arms could match thee in contention,
226: As they contend with thee in courtesy.
227: HECTOR: I would they could.
228: NESTOR: Ha!
229: By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee to-morrow.
230: Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.
231: ULYSSES: I wonder now how yonder city stands
232: When we have here her base and pillar by us.
233: HECTOR: I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.
234: Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,
235: Since first I saw yourself and Diomed
236: In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.
237: ULYSSES: Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue:
238: My prophecy is but half his journey yet;
239: For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,
240: Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,
241: Must kiss their own feet.
242: HECTOR: I must not believe you:
243: There they stand yet, and modestly I think,
244: The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
245: A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,
246: And that old common arbitrator, Time,
247: Will one day end it.
248: ULYSSES: So to him we leave it.
249: Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:
250: After the general, I beseech you next
251: To feast with me and see me at my tent.
252: ACHILLES: I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!
253: Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;
254: I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,
255: And quoted joint by joint.
256: HECTOR: Is this Achilles?
257: ACHILLES: I am Achilles.
258: HECTOR: Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee.
259: ACHILLES: Behold thy fill.
260: HECTOR: Nay, I have done already.
261: ACHILLES: Thou art too brief: I will the second time,
262: As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.
263: HECTOR: O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;
264: But there's more in me than thou understand'st.
265: Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?
266: ACHILLES: Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body
267: Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?
268: That I may give the local wound a name
269: And make distinct the very breach whereout
270: Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!
271: HECTOR: It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,
272: To answer such a question: stand again:
273: Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
274: As to prenominate in nice conjecture
275: Where thou wilt hit me dead?
276: ACHILLES: I tell thee, yea.
277: HECTOR: Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,
278: I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;
279: For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;
280: But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,
281: I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.
282: You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;
283: His insolence draws folly from my lips;
284: But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,
285: Or may I never--
286: AJAX: Do not chafe thee, cousin:
287: And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,
288: Till accident or purpose bring you to't:
289: You may have every day enough of Hector
290: If you have stomach; the general state, I fear,
291: Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.
292: HECTOR: I pray you, let us see you in the field:
293: We have had pelting wars, since you refused
294: The Grecians' cause.
295: ACHILLES: Dost thou entreat me, Hector?
296: To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;
297: To-night all friends.
298: HECTOR: Thy hand upon that match.
299: AGAMEMNON: First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;
300: There in the full convive we: afterwards,
301: As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall
302: Concur together, severally entreat him.
303: Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,
304: That this great soldier may his welcome know.
305: TROILUS: My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,
306: In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?
307: ULYSSES: At Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus:
308: There Diomed doth feast with him to-night;
309: Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,
310: But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
311: On the fair Cressid.
312: TROILUS: Shall sweet lord, be bound to you so much,
313: After we part from Agamemnon's tent,
314: To bring me thither?
315: ULYSSES: You shall command me, sir.
316: As gentle tell me, of what honour was
317: This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there
318: That wails her absence?
ACT 5 SCENE 1

1: ACHILLES: I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to-night,
2: Which with my scimitar I'll cool to-morrow.
3: Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.
4: PATROCLUS: Here comes Thersites.
5: ACHILLES: How now, thou core of envy!
6: Thou crusty batch of nature, what's the news?
7: THERSITES: Why, thou picture of what thou seemest, and idol
8: of idiot worshippers, here's a letter for thee.
9: ACHILLES: From whence, fragment?
10: THERSITES: Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.
11: PATROCLUS: Who keeps the tent now?
12: THERSITES: The surgeon's box, or the patient's wound.
13: PATROCLUS: Well said, adversity! and what need these tricks?
14: THERSITES: Prithee, be silent, boy; I profit not by thy talk:
15: thou art thought to be Achilles' male varlet.
16: PATROCLUS: Male varlet, you rogue! what's that?
17: THERSITES: Why, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseases
18: of the south, the guts-griping, ruptures, catarrhs,
19: loads o' gravel i' the back, lethargies, cold
20: palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing
21: lungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas,
22: limekilns i' the palm, incurable bone-ache, and the
23: rivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and take
24: again such preposterous discoveries!
25: PATROCLUS: Why thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanest
26: thou to curse thus?
27: THERSITES: Do I curse thee?
28: PATROCLUS: Why no, you ruinous butt, you whoreson
29: indistinguishable cur, no.
30: THERSITES: No! why art thou then exasperate, thou idle
31: immaterial skein of sleave-silk, thou green sarcenet
32: flap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal's
33: purse, thou? Ah, how the poor world is pestered
34: with such waterflies, diminutives of nature!
35: PATROCLUS: Out, gall!
36: THERSITES: Finch-egg!
37: ACHILLES: My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite
38: From my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.
39: Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba,
40: A token from her daughter, my fair love,
41: Both taxing me and gaging me to keep
42: An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it:
43: Fall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;
44: My major vow lies here, this I'll obey.
45: Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent:
46: This night in banqueting must all be spent.
47: Away, Patroclus!
48: THERSITES: With too much blood and too little brain, these two
49: may run mad; but, if with too much brain and too
50: little blood they do, I'll be a curer of madmen.
51: Here's Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough and one
52: that loves quails; but he has not so much brain as
53: earwax: and the goodly transformation of Jupiter
54: there, his brother, the bull,--the primitive statue,
55: and oblique memorial of cuckolds; a thrifty
56: shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother's
57: leg,--to what form but that he is, should wit larded
58: with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to?
59: To an ass, were nothing; he is both ass and ox: to
60: an ox, were nothing; he is both ox and ass. To be a
61: dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a toad, a lizard, an
62: owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would
63: not care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire
64: against destiny. Ask me not, what I would be, if I
65: were not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse
66: of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus! Hey-day!
67: spirits and fires!
68: AGAMEMNON: We go wrong, we go wrong.
69: AJAX: No, yonder 'tis;
70: There, where we see the lights.
71: HECTOR: I trouble you.
72: AJAX: No, not a whit.
73: ULYSSES: Here comes himself to guide you.
74: ACHILLES: Welcome, brave Hector; welcome, princes all.
75: AGAMEMNON: So now, fair prince of Troy, I bid good night.
76: Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.
77: HECTOR: Thanks and good night to the Greeks' general.
78: MENELAUS: Good night, my lord.
79: HECTOR: Good night, sweet lord Menelaus.
80: THERSITES: Sweet draught: 'sweet' quoth 'a! sweet sink,
81: sweet sewer.
82: ACHILLES: Good night and welcome, both at once, to those
83: That go or tarry.
84: AGAMEMNON: Good night.
85: ACHILLES: Old Nestor tarries; and you too, Diomed,
86: Keep Hector company an hour or two.
87: DIOMEDES: I cannot, lord; I have important business,
88: The tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector.
89: HECTOR: Give me your hand.
90: ULYSSES: [Aside to TROILUS] Follow his torch; he goes to
91: Calchas' tent:
92: I'll keep you company.
93: TROILUS: Sweet sir, you honour me.
94: HECTOR: And so, good night.
95: ACHILLES: Come, come, enter my tent.
96: THERSITES: That same Diomed's a false-hearted rogue, a most
97: unjust knave; I will no more trust him when he leers
98: than I will a serpent when he hisses: he will spend
99: his mouth, and promise, like Brabbler the hound:
100: but when he performs, astronomers foretell it; it
101: is prodigious, there will come some change; the sun
102: borrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his
103: word. I will rather leave to see Hector, than
104: not to dog him: they say he keeps a Trojan
105: drab, and uses the traitor Calchas' tent: I'll
106: after. Nothing but lechery! all incontinent varlets!
ACT 5 SCENE 10

1: AENEAS: Stand, ho! yet are we masters of the field:
2: Never go home; here starve we out the night.
3: TROILUS: Hector is slain.
4: ALL: Hector! the gods forbid!
5: TROILUS: He's dead; and at the murderer's horse's tail,
6: In beastly sort, dragg'd through the shameful field.
7: Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed!
8: Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!
9: I say, at once let your brief plagues be mercy,
10: And linger not our sure destructions on!
11: AENEAS: My lord, you do discomfort all the host!
12: TROILUS: You understand me not that tell me so:
13: I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,
14: But dare all imminence that gods and men
15: Address their dangers in. Hector is gone:
16: Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?
17: Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd,
18: Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector's dead:
19: There is a word will Priam turn to stone;
20: Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,
21: Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,
22: Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away:
23: Hector is dead; there is no more to say.
24: Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,
25: Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,
26: Let Titan rise as early as he dare,
27: I'll through and through you! and, thou great-sized coward,
28: No space of earth shall sunder our two hates:
29: I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,
30: That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts.
31: Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go:
32: Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.
33: PANDARUS: But hear you, hear you!
34: TROILUS: Hence, broker-lackey! ignomy and shame
35: Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!
ACT 5 SCENE 2

1: DIOMEDES: What, are you up here, ho? speak.
2: CALCHAS: [Within] Who calls?
3: DIOMEDES: Calchas, I think. Where's your daughter?
4: CALCHAS: [Within] She comes to you.
5: ULYSSES: Stand where the torch may not discover us.
6: TROILUS: Cressid comes forth to him.
7: DIOMEDES: How now, my charge!
8: CRESSIDA: Now, my sweet guardian! Hark, a word with you.
9: TROILUS: Yea, so familiar!
10: ULYSSES: She will sing any man at first sight.
11: THERSITES: And any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff;
12: she's noted.
13: DIOMEDES: Will you remember?
14: CRESSIDA: Remember! yes.
15: DIOMEDES: Nay, but do, then;
16: And let your mind be coupled with your words.
17: TROILUS: What should she remember?
18: ULYSSES: List.
19: CRESSIDA: Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.
20: THERSITES: Roguery!
21: DIOMEDES: Nay, then,--
22: CRESSIDA: I'll tell you what,--
23: DIOMEDES: Foh, foh! come, tell a pin: you are forsworn.
24: CRESSIDA: In faith, I cannot: what would you have me do?
25: THERSITES: A juggling trick,--to be secretly open.
26: DIOMEDES: What did you swear you would bestow on me?
27: CRESSIDA: I prithee, do not hold me to mine oath;
28: Bid me do any thing but that, sweet Greek.
29: DIOMEDES: Good night.
30: TROILUS: Hold, patience!
31: ULYSSES: How now, Trojan!
32: CRESSIDA: Diomed,--
33: DIOMEDES: No, no, good night: I'll be your fool no more.
34: TROILUS: Thy better must.
35: CRESSIDA: Hark, one word in your ear.
36: TROILUS: O plague and madness!
37: ULYSSES: You are moved, prince; let us depart, I pray you,
38: Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself
39: To wrathful terms: this place is dangerous;
40: The time right deadly; I beseech you, go.
41: TROILUS: Behold, I pray you!
42: ULYSSES: Nay, good my lord, go off:
43: You flow to great distraction; come, my lord.
44: TROILUS: I pray thee, stay.
45: ULYSSES: You have not patience; come.
46: TROILUS: I pray you, stay; by hell and all hell's torments
47: I will not speak a word!
48: DIOMEDES: And so, good night.
49: CRESSIDA: Nay, but you part in anger.
50: TROILUS: Doth that grieve thee?
51: O wither'd truth!
52: ULYSSES: Why, how now, lord!
53: TROILUS: By Jove,
54: I will be patient.
55: CRESSIDA: Guardian!--why, Greek!
56: DIOMEDES: Foh, foh! adieu; you palter.
57: CRESSIDA: In faith, I do not: come hither once again.
58: ULYSSES: You shake, my lord, at something: will you go?
59: You will break out.
60: TROILUS: She strokes his cheek!
61: ULYSSES: Come, come.
62: TROILUS: Nay, stay; by Jove, I will not speak a word:
63: There is between my will and all offences
64: A guard of patience: stay a little while.
65: THERSITES: How the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and
66: potato-finger, tickles these together! Fry, lechery, fry!
67: DIOMEDES: But will you, then?
68: CRESSIDA: In faith, I will, la; never trust me else.
69: DIOMEDES: Give me some token for the surety of it.
70: CRESSIDA: I'll fetch you one.
71: ULYSSES: You have sworn patience.
72: TROILUS: Fear me not, sweet lord;
73: I will not be myself, nor have cognition
74: Of what I feel: I am all patience.
75: THERSITES: Now the pledge; now, now, now!
76: CRESSIDA: Here, Diomed, keep this sleeve.
77: TROILUS: O beauty! where is thy faith?
78: ULYSSES: My lord,--
79: TROILUS: I will be patient; outwardly I will.
80: CRESSIDA: You look upon that sleeve; behold it well.
81: He loved me--O false wench!--Give't me again.
82: DIOMEDES: Whose was't?
83: CRESSIDA: It is no matter, now I have't again.
84: I will not meet with you to-morrow night:
85: I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more.
86: THERSITES: Now she sharpens: well said, whetstone!
87: DIOMEDES: I shall have it.
88: CRESSIDA: What, this?
89: DIOMEDES: Ay, that.
90: CRESSIDA: O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!
91: Thy master now lies thinking in his bed
92: Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
93: And gives memorial dainty kisses to it,
94: As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me;
95: He that takes that doth take my heart withal.
96: DIOMEDES: I had your heart before, this follows it.
97: TROILUS: I did swear patience.
98: CRESSIDA: You shall not have it, Diomed; faith, you shall not;
99: I'll give you something else.
100: DIOMEDES: I will have this: whose was it?
101: CRESSIDA: It is no matter.
102: DIOMEDES: Come, tell me whose it was.
103: CRESSIDA: 'Twas one's that loved me better than you will.
104: But, now you have it, take it.
105: DIOMEDES: Whose was it?
106: CRESSIDA: By all Diana's waiting-women yond,
107: And by herself, I will not tell you whose.
108: DIOMEDES: To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,
109: And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.
110: TROILUS: Wert thou the devil, and worest it on thy horn,
111: It should be challenged.
112: CRESSIDA: Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past: and yet it is not;
113: I will not keep my word.
114: DIOMEDES: Why, then, farewell;
115: Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.
116: CRESSIDA: You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,
117: But it straight starts you.
118: DIOMEDES: I do not like this fooling.
119: THERSITES: Nor I, by Pluto: but that that likes not you pleases me best.
120: DIOMEDES: What, shall I come? the hour?
121: CRESSIDA: Ay, come:--O Jove!--do come:--I shall be plagued.
122: DIOMEDES: Farewell till then.
123: CRESSIDA: Good night: I prithee, come.
124: Troilus, farewell! one eye yet looks on thee
125: But with my heart the other eye doth see.
126: Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find,
127: The error of our eye directs our mind:
128: What error leads must err; O, then conclude
129: Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude.
130: THERSITES: A proof of strength she could not publish more,
131: Unless she said ' My mind is now turn'd whore.'
132: ULYSSES: All's done, my lord.
133: TROILUS: It is.
134: ULYSSES: Why stay we, then?
135: TROILUS: To make a recordation to my soul
136: Of every syllable that here was spoke.
137: But if I tell how these two did co-act,
138: Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?
139: Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,
140: An esperance so obstinately strong,
141: That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears,
142: As if those organs had deceptious functions,
143: Created only to calumniate.
144: Was Cressid here?
145: ULYSSES: I cannot conjure, Trojan.
146: TROILUS: She was not, sure.
147: ULYSSES: Most sure she was.
148: TROILUS: Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.
149: ULYSSES: Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.
150: TROILUS: Let it not be believed for womanhood!
151: Think, we had mothers; do not give advantage
152: To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,
153: For depravation, to square the general sex
154: By Cressid's rule: rather think this not Cressid.
155: ULYSSES: What hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers?
156: TROILUS: Nothing at all, unless that this were she.
157: THERSITES: Will he swagger himself out on's own eyes?
158: TROILUS: This she? no, this is Diomed's Cressida:
159: If beauty have a soul, this is not she;
160: If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,
161: If sanctimony be the gods' delight,
162: If there be rule in unity itself,
163: This is not she. O madness of discourse,
164: That cause sets up with and against itself!
165: Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt
166: Without perdition, and loss assume all reason
167: Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid.
168: Within my soul there doth conduce a fight
169: Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate
170: Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
171: And yet the spacious breadth of this division
172: Admits no orifex for a point as subtle
173: As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.
174: Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;
175: Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven:
176: Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself;
177: The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolved, and loosed;
178: And with another knot, five-finger-tied,
179: The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,
180: The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics
181: Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed.
182: ULYSSES: May worthy Troilus be half attach'd
183: With that which here his passion doth express?
184: TROILUS: Ay, Greek; and that shall be divulged well
185: In characters as red as Mars his heart
186: Inflamed with Venus: never did young man fancy
187: With so eternal and so fix'd a soul.
188: Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,
189: So much by weight hate I her Diomed:
190: That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm;
191: Were it a casque composed by Vulcan's skill,
192: My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout
193: Which shipmen do the hurricano call,
194: Constringed in mass by the almighty sun,
195: Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune's ear
196: In his descent than shall my prompted sword
197: Falling on Diomed.
198: THERSITES: He'll tickle it for his concupy.
199: TROILUS: O Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!
200: Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,
201: And they'll seem glorious.
202: ULYSSES: O, contain yourself
203: Your passion draws ears hither.
204: AENEAS: I have been seeking you this hour, my lord:
205: Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy;
206: Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.
207: TROILUS: Have with you, prince. My courteous lord, adieu.
208: Farewell, revolted fair! and, Diomed,
209: Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head!
210: ULYSSES: I'll bring you to the gates.
211: TROILUS: Accept distracted thanks.
212: THERSITES: Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would
213: croak like a raven; I would bode, I would bode.
214: Patroclus will give me any thing for the
215: intelligence of this whore: the parrot will not
216: do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab.
217: Lechery, lechery; still, wars and lechery; nothing
218: else holds fashion: a burning devil take them!
ACT 5 SCENE 3

1: ANDROMACHE: When was my lord so much ungently temper'd,
2: To stop his ears against admonishment?
3: Unarm, unarm, and do not fight to-day.
4: HECTOR: You train me to offend you; get you in:
5: By all the everlasting gods, I'll go!
6: ANDROMACHE: My dreams will, sure, prove ominous to the day.
7: HECTOR: No more, I say.
8: CASSANDRA: Where is my brother Hector?
9: ANDROMACHE: Here, sister; arm'd, and bloody in intent.
10: Consort with me in loud and dear petition,
11: Pursue we him on knees; for I have dream'd
12: Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night
13: Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.
14: CASSANDRA: O, 'tis true.
15: HECTOR: Ho! bid my trumpet sound!
16: CASSANDRA: No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother.
17: HECTOR: Be gone, I say: the gods have heard me swear.
18: CASSANDRA: The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows:
19: They are polluted offerings, more abhorr'd
20: Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.
21: ANDROMACHE: O, be persuaded! do not count it holy
22: To hurt by being just: it is as lawful,
23: For we would give much, to use violent thefts,
24: And rob in the behalf of charity.
25: CASSANDRA: It is the purpose that makes strong the vow;
26: But vows to every purpose must not hold:
27: Unarm, sweet Hector.
28: HECTOR: Hold you still, I say;
29: Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate:
30: Lie every man holds dear; but the brave man
31: Holds honour far more precious-dear than life.
32: How now, young man! mean'st thou to fight to-day?
33: ANDROMACHE: Cassandra, call my father to persuade.
34: HECTOR: No, faith, young Troilus; doff thy harness, youth;
35: I am to-day i' the vein of chivalry:
36: Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,
37: And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.
38: Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,
39: I'll stand to-day for thee and me and Troy.
40: TROILUS: Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you,
41: Which better fits a lion than a man.
42: HECTOR: What vice is that, good Troilus? chide me for it.
43: TROILUS: When many times the captive Grecian falls,
44: Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword,
45: You bid them rise, and live.
46: HECTOR: O,'tis fair play.
47: TROILUS: Fool's play, by heaven, Hector.
48: HECTOR: How now! how now!
49: TROILUS: For the love of all the gods,
50: Let's leave the hermit pity with our mothers,
51: And when we have our armours buckled on,
52: The venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords,
53: Spur them to ruthful work, rein them from ruth.
54: HECTOR: Fie, savage, fie!
55: TROILUS: Hector, then 'tis wars.
56: HECTOR: Troilus, I would not have you fight to-day.
57: TROILUS: Who should withhold me?
58: Not fate, obedience, nor the hand of Mars
59: Beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire;
60: Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees,
61: Their eyes o'ergalled with recourse of tears;
62: Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
63: Opposed to hinder me, should stop my way,
64: But by my ruin.
65: CASSANDRA: Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:
66: He is thy crutch; now if thou lose thy stay,
67: Thou on him leaning, and all Troy on thee,
68: Fall all together.
69: PRIAM: Come, Hector, come, go back:
70: Thy wife hath dream'd; thy mother hath had visions;
71: Cassandra doth foresee; and I myself
72: Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
73: To tell thee that this day is ominous:
74: Therefore, come back.
75: HECTOR: AEneas is a-field;
76: And I do stand engaged to many Greeks,
77: Even in the faith of valour, to appear
78: This morning to them.
79: PRIAM: Ay, but thou shalt not go.
80: HECTOR: I must not break my faith.
81: You know me dutiful; therefore, dear sir,
82: Let me not shame respect; but give me leave
83: To take that course by your consent and voice,
84: Which you do here forbid me, royal Priam.
85: CASSANDRA: O Priam, yield not to him!
86: ANDROMACHE: Do not, dear father.
87: HECTOR: Andromache, I am offended with you:
88: Upon the love you bear me, get you in.
89: TROILUS: This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl
90: Makes all these bodements.
91: CASSANDRA: O, farewell, dear Hector!
92: Look, how thou diest! look, how thy eye turns pale!
93: Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!
94: Hark, how Troy roars! how Hecuba cries out!
95: How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth!
96: Behold, distraction, frenzy and amazement,
97: Like witless antics, one another meet,
98: And all cry, Hector! Hector's dead! O Hector!
99: TROILUS: Away! away!
100: CASSANDRA: Farewell: yet, soft! Hector! take my leave:
101: Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive.
102: HECTOR: You are amazed, my liege, at her exclaim:
103: Go in and cheer the town: we'll forth and fight,
104: Do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night.
105: PRIAM: Farewell: the gods with safety stand about thee!
106: TROILUS: They are at it, hark! Proud Diomed, believe,
107: I come to lose my arm, or win my sleeve.
108: PANDARUS: Do you hear, my lord? do you hear?
109: TROILUS: What now?
110: PANDARUS: Here's a letter come from yond poor girl.
111: TROILUS: Let me read.
112: PANDARUS: A whoreson tisick, a whoreson rascally tisick so
113: troubles me, and the foolish fortune of this girl;
114: and what one thing, what another, that I shall
115: leave you one o' these days: and I have a rheum
116: in mine eyes too, and such an ache in my bones
117: that, unless a man were cursed, I cannot tell what
118: to think on't. What says she there?
119: TROILUS: Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart:
120: The effect doth operate another way.
121: Go, wind, to wind, there turn and change together.
122: My love with words and errors still she feeds;
123: But edifies another with her deeds.
ACT 5 SCENE 4

1: THERSITES: Now they are clapper-clawing one another; I'll go
2: look on. That dissembling abominable varlets Diomed,
3: has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave's
4: sleeve of Troy there in his helm: I would fain see
5: them meet; that that same young Trojan ass, that
6: loves the whore there, might send that Greekish
7: whore-masterly villain, with the sleeve, back to the
8: dissembling luxurious drab, of a sleeveless errand.
9: O' the t'other side, the policy of those crafty
10: swearing rascals, that stale old mouse-eaten dry
11: cheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, is
12: not proved worthy a blackberry: they set me up, in
13: policy, that mongrel cur, Ajax, against that dog of
14: as bad a kind, Achilles: and now is the cur Ajax
15: prouder than the cur Achilles, and will not arm
16: to-day; whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim
17: barbarism, and policy grows into an ill opinion.
18: Soft! here comes sleeve, and t'other.
19: TROILUS: Fly not; for shouldst thou take the river Styx,
20: I would swim after.
21: DIOMEDES: Thou dost miscall retire:
22: I do not fly, but advantageous care
23: Withdrew me from the odds of multitude:
24: Have at thee!
25: THERSITES: Hold thy whore, Grecian!--now for thy whore,
26: Trojan!--now the sleeve, now the sleeve!
27: HECTOR: What art thou, Greek? art thou for Hector's match?
28: Art thou of blood and honour?
29: THERSITES: No, no, I am a rascal; a scurvy railing knave:
30: a very filthy rogue.
31: HECTOR: I do believe thee: live.
32: THERSITES: God-a-mercy, that thou wilt believe me; but a
33: plague break thy neck for frightening me! What's
34: become of the wenching rogues? I think they have
35: swallowed one another: I would laugh at that
36: miracle: yet, in a sort, lechery eats itself.
37: I'll seek them.
ACT 5 SCENE 5

1: DIOMEDES: Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus' horse;
2: Present the fair steed to my lady Cressid:
3: Fellow, commend my service to her beauty;
4: Tell her I have chastised the amorous Trojan,
5: And am her knight by proof.
6: Servant: I go, my lord.
7: AGAMEMNON: Renew, renew! The fierce Polydamas
8: Hath beat down Menon: bastard Margarelon
9: Hath Doreus prisoner,
10: And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam,
11: Upon the pashed corses of the kings
12: Epistrophus and Cedius: Polyxenes is slain,
13: Amphimachus and Thoas deadly hurt,
14: Patroclus ta'en or slain, and Palamedes
15: Sore hurt and bruised: the dreadful Sagittary
16: Appals our numbers: haste we, Diomed,
17: To reinforcement, or we perish all.
18: NESTOR: Go, bear Patroclus' body to Achilles;
19: And bid the snail-paced Ajax arm for shame.
20: There is a thousand Hectors in the field:
21: Now here he fights on Galathe his horse,
22: And there lacks work; anon he's there afoot,
23: And there they fly or die, like scaled sculls
24: Before the belching whale; then is he yonder,
25: And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,
26: Fall down before him, like the mower's swath:
27: Here, there, and every where, he leaves and takes,
28: Dexterity so obeying appetite
29: That what he will he does, and does so much
30: That proof is call'd impossibility.
31: ULYSSES: O, courage, courage, princes! great Achilles
32: Is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance:
33: Patroclus' wounds have roused his drowsy blood,
34: Together with his mangled Myrmidons,
35: That noseless, handless, hack'd and chipp'd, come to him,
36: Crying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend
37: And foams at mouth, and he is arm'd and at it,
38: Roaring for Troilus, who hath done to-day
39: Mad and fantastic execution,
40: Engaging and redeeming of himself
41: With such a careless force and forceless care
42: As if that luck, in very spite of cunning,
43: Bade him win all.
44: AJAX: Troilus! thou coward Troilus!
45: DIOMEDES: Ay, there, there.
46: NESTOR: So, so, we draw together.
47: ACHILLES: Where is this Hector?
48: Come, come, thou boy-queller, show thy face;
49: Know what it is to meet Achilles angry:
50: Hector? where's Hector? I will none but Hector.
ACT 5 SCENE 6

1: AJAX: Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head!
2: DIOMEDES: Troilus, I say! where's Troilus?
3: AJAX: What wouldst thou?
4: DIOMEDES: I would correct him.
5: AJAX: Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office
6: Ere that correction. Troilus, I say! what, Troilus!
7: TROILUS: O traitor Diomed! turn thy false face, thou traitor,
8: And pay thy life thou owest me for my horse!
9: DIOMEDES: Ha, art thou there?
10: AJAX: I'll fight with him alone: stand, Diomed.
11: DIOMEDES: He is my prize; I will not look upon.
12: TROILUS: Come, both you cogging Greeks; have at you both!
13: HECTOR: Yea, Troilus? O, well fought, my youngest brother!
14: ACHILLES: Now do I see thee, ha! have at thee, Hector!
15: HECTOR: Pause, if thou wilt.
16: ACHILLES: I do disdain thy courtesy, proud Trojan:
17: Be happy that my arms are out of use:
18: My rest and negligence befriends thee now,
19: But thou anon shalt hear of me again;
20: Till when, go seek thy fortune.
21: HECTOR: Fare thee well:
22: I would have been much more a fresher man,
23: Had I expected thee. How now, my brother!
24: TROILUS: Ajax hath ta'en AEneas: shall it be?
25: No, by the flame of yonder glorious heaven,
26: He shall not carry him: I'll be ta'en too,
27: Or bring him off: fate, hear me what I say!
28: I reck not though I end my life to-day.
29: HECTOR: Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark:
30: No? wilt thou not? I like thy armour well;
31: I'll frush it and unlock the rivets all,
32: But I'll be master of it: wilt thou not,
33: beast, abide?
34: Why, then fly on, I'll hunt thee for thy hide.
ACT 5 SCENE 7

1: ACHILLES: Come here about me, you my Myrmidons;
2: Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel:
3: Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath:
4: And when I have the bloody Hector found,
5: Empale him with your weapons round about;
6: In fellest manner execute your aims.
7: Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye:
8: It is decreed Hector the great must die.
9: THERSITES: The cuckold and the cuckold-maker are at it. Now,
10: bull! now, dog! 'Loo, Paris, 'loo! now my double-
11: henned sparrow! 'loo, Paris, 'loo! The bull has the
12: game: ware horns, ho!
13: MARGARELON: Turn, slave, and fight.
14: THERSITES: What art thou?
15: MARGARELON: A bastard son of Priam's.
16: THERSITES: I am a bastard too; I love bastards: I am a bastard
17: begot, bastard instructed, bastard in mind, bastard
18: in valour, in every thing illegitimate. One bear will
19: not bite another, and wherefore should one bastard?
20: Take heed, the quarrel's most ominous to us: if the
21: son of a whore fight for a whore, he tempts judgment:
22: farewell, bastard.
23: MARGARELON: The devil take thee, coward!
ACT 5 SCENE 8

1: HECTOR: Most putrefied core, so fair without,
2: Thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life.
3: Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:
4: Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.
5: ACHILLES: Look, Hector, how the sun begins to set;
6: How ugly night comes breathing at his heels:
7: Even with the vail and darking of the sun,
8: To close the day up, Hector's life is done.
9: HECTOR: I am unarm'd; forego this vantage, Greek.
10: ACHILLES: Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.
11: So, Ilion, fall thou next! now, Troy, sink down!
12: Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.
13: On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain,
14: 'Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.'
15: Hark! a retire upon our Grecian part.
16: MYRMIDONS: The Trojan trumpets sound the like, my lord.
17: ACHILLES: The dragon wing of night o'erspreads the earth,
18: And, stickler-like, the armies separates.
19: My half-supp'd sword, that frankly would have fed,
20: Pleased with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.
21: Come, tie his body to my horse's tail;
22: Along the field I will the Trojan trail.
ACT 5 SCENE 9

1: AGAMEMNON: Hark! hark! what shout is that?
2: NESTOR: Peace, drums!
3: Achilles! Achilles! Hector's slain! Achilles.
4: DIOMEDES: The bruit is, Hector's slain, and by Achilles.
5: AJAX: If it be so, yet bragless let it be;
6: Great Hector was a man as good as he.
7: AGAMEMNON: March patiently along: let one be sent
8: To pray Achilles see us at our tent.
9: If in his death the gods have us befriended,
10: Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.
