        "Steevens: carry coals] Warburton observes that this was a phrase formerly in use to signify the bearing of injuries; but, as he gives no instances, I subjoin the following. Nash in his Have With you to Saffron Walden, 1595, says: “We will bear no coles, I warrant you.” Again, in Marston’s Antonio and Mellida, second part, 1602: “He has had wrongs; and if I were he I would bear no coles.\" Again, in Law Tricks, by John Day, 1608: “I’ll carry coals an you will, no horns.” In May-Day, by Chapman, 1610 [in Sing., 1605]: “You must swear by no man’s beard but your own, for that may breed a quarrel; above all things you must carry no coals.\" “ Now, my ancient being a man of an un-coal-carrying spirit,” etc. Again, in Ben Jonson’s Every Man out of his Humour; “Here comes one that will carry coals; ergo, will hold my dog.” [Cham.] In Hen. V; III, ii, 49: “At Calais they stole a fire-shovel; I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals,\" [Sing. Huds.] Again, in The Malcontent, 1604: “ Great slaves fear better than love, born naturally for a coal-basket,\" \\Jlal. Percy. This phrase continued in use to the middle of the last century. In a little satirical piece of Sir John Birkenhead, entitled Two Centuries [of books] of St. Paul’s Churchyard, etc., published after the death of King Charles I, No. 22, p. 50, is inserted Fire! fire! a small manual, dedicated to Sir Arthur Haselridge; in which it is plainly proved by a whole chauldron of Scripture that John Lillburn will not carry coals!' By Dr. Gouge. \\Hal. Narks. The origin of the phrase is this, that in every family the scullions, the turnspits, the carriers of wood and coals were esteemed the very lowest of menials. The latter in particular were the servi servorum, the drudges of all the rest. Such attendants upon the royal households in progresses were jocularly called the “ black-guard,” and hence the origin of that term. [Sing. Huds.] In most of these cases charcoal is probably meant."

        "Knt.: Upon a passage in Ben Jonson’s “Every Man out of his Humour,” Gifford has this note; “ In all great houses, but particularly in the royal residences, there were a number of mean and dirty dependants whose office it was to attend to the wood-yard and sculleries, etc. Of these (for in the lowest deep there was a deeper still), the most forlorn wretches seem to have been selected to carry coals to the kitchen, halls, etc. To this smutty regiment, who attended the progresses and rode in the cart with the pots and kettles, which, with every other article of furniture, were then moved from palace to palace, the people in derision gave the name of blackguards, a term since become familiar, and never properly explained.” [Com. Sta. Dyce.] In this passage from Ben Jonson, we find the primary meaning of the expression—that of being fit for servile offices; in a subsequent passage we have the secondary meaning—that of tamely submitting to an affront. Puntarvolo insults Shift, who, he supposes, has taken his dog; upon which another character exclaims: “ Take heed, Sir Puntarvolo, what you do! he’ll bear no coals, I can tell you.” Gifford gives an illustration of this meaning (which is the sense in which Sh. here uses it); —“ the queen was exceedingly well satisfied: saying that you were too like some body in the world, to whom she is afrayde you are a little kin, to be content to carry coales at any Frenchman’s hand.” Secretary Cecyll to Sir Henry Neville, March 2, * 559. White. This phrase was euphemistic slang for “to put up with an insult.” Dyce. To submit to any degradation (“II a du feu en la teste. II et tholle7’icke, furious, or couragious; he will cari'ie no coaleil.' Cotgrave’s Fr, and Engl. Diet., sub. “Teste”). “To carry coals, va the sense of tamely putting up an affront, occurs perpetually in our old writers, both serious and comic.” Gifford’s Jonson, vol. ii, p. 169. (In Lyly’s Midas, mention is made of “one of the Cole house,” sig. f; 4, ed. 1592 i. e., one of the drudges about the palace of Midas.)"

This mode of quarreling appears to have been common in our author’s time. “ What swearing is there” (says Decker, describing the groups that frequented the walks of St. Paul’s Church), “what shouldering, what justling, what jeering, what byting oj thumbs, to beget quarrels!” The Dead Term, 1608.

There can be little doubt, we apprehend, that this mode of insult was originally peculiar to Italy, and was perhaps a mitigated form of the greater insult of making the fig or fico, that is, thrusting out the thumb in a peculiar manner between the fingers. Douce has bestowed much laborious investigation upon this difficult and somewhat worthless subject. The commentators have not distinctly alluded to what appears to us the identity of biting the thumb and the fico; but the passage in Lodge’s “Wits Miserie” clearly shows that the customs were one and the same. Sing. The mode in which this contemptuous action was performed is thus described by Cotgrave, in a passage which has escaped the industry of all the commentators; “ Faire la nique; to mocke by nodding or lifting up the chinne; or more properly, to threaten or defie, by putting the thumbe naile into the mouth, and with a jerke (from the upper teeth) make it to knacke.” [Corn. Huds. Dyce, Sta. Hal. Cham. Clarke. Hunter. A trait of Italian manners. Thus Fuller, in his Abel Redivivus, p. 38, after relating a conversation between Luther and a messenger of Cardinal Cajetan, says, “At this the messenger, after the Italian manner, biting his thumbs, went away.” Sta. This contemptuous action, though obsolete in this country, is still in use both in France and Italy; but Knight is mistaken in supposing it identical with what is giving the fico. Biting the thumb is performed by biting the thumb-nail; or as Cotgrave describes it [as cited by Singer]: The more offensive gesticulation of giving the fico was by thrusting out the thumb between the forefingers, or putting it in the mouth so as to swell out the cheek.",
        "Steevens: I will bite my thumb at them] See above (note at line 12) for detailed explanation and citations regarding the custom, also that it was a mode of Italian insult, akin to giving the fico."

Exactly as we now say dashing; spirited and calculated to surprise. Also [as in this place] violent, overpowering. Knt. Samson and Gregory are described as armed with swords and bucklers. The swashing blow is a blow upon the buckler; the blow accompanied with a noise; and thus a swasher came to be synonymous with a quarrelsome fellow, a braggart. In Henry V, Bardolph, Pistol, and Nym are called by the boy three “swashers.” Holinshed has: “a man may see how many bloody quarrels a brawling swash buckler may pick out of a bottle of hay;” and Fuller, in his “Worthies,” after describing a swaggerer as one that endeavors to make that side to swagger, or weigh down, whereon he engages, tells us that a swash-buckler is so called from swashing or making a noise on bucklers. Del. The “swashing blow” of the Ff. might be justified, at a pinch, as a laughable mistake for the correct phrase, purposely put into the mouth of a servant. Sta.

To swash, clango, gladiis concrepo, Coles. Forby has swash, to affect valour, to vapour, or swagger; but these are secondary meanings. When as the fight therefore grew exceeding sharpe and hot, with much slaughter and bloudslied, every one who was more readie to rush upon the thickest of the enemies, whiles on all sides swords swashed and darts flew as thick as haile, lost his life.

Scott has made the cry familiar to us in “The Fortunes of Nigel;” and when the citizens of Verona here raise it, we involuntarily think of the old watch-maker’s hatch-door in Fleet Street and Jin Vin and Tunstall darting off for the affray. “The great long club” as described by Stow, on the necks of the London apprentices, was as characteristic as the flat cap of the same (luarrelsome body, in the days of Elizabeth and James. The use by Sh. of home phrases, in the mouth of foreign characters, was a part of his art. It is the same thing as rendering Sancho’s Spanish proverbs into the corresponding English proverbs, instead of literally translating them. The cry of clubs by the citizens of Verona expressed an idea of popular movement, which could not have been conveyed half so emphatically in a foreign phrase. [ Verp. Huds., IIaz. As we should now say, police. Hunter. This word should probably be so printed as to indicate that the citizen called out, “Clubs,” an English expression used to part combatants.

With his accustomed judgment, Shakespeare has begun by placing before us a lively picture of all the impulses of the play; and as nature ever presents two sides, one for Heraclitus and one for Democritus, he has, by way of prelude, shown the laughable absurdity of the evil by the contagion of it reaching the servants, who have so little to do with it, but who are under the necessity of letting the superfluity of sensorial power fly off through the escape-valve of wit-combats, and of quarreling with weapons of a sharper edge, all in humble imitation of their masters. Yet there is a sort of unhi red fidelity, an ourishness about all this, that makes it rest pleasant on one’s feelings. All the first scene, down to the conclusion of the Prince’s speech, is a motley dance of all ranks and ages to one tune, as if the horn of Huon had been playing behind the scenes. Illuds."

Dyce (ed. 2): Since printing the text of this play, I almost regret that I did not retain the usual arrangement. The passage, however, may be right as it stands, for our early dramatists sometimes introduce short rhyming lines in the midst of blank-verse dialogues, as in Love’s Labour’s Lost, I, i, 126, 127. Ktly. I make this insertion, “gentle cousin,” with confidence, for this is the only speech in this play beginning with a short line not complementary to the end of a preceding speech. In our poet’s plays of this period, speeches never began with a short line, unless when complementary, and at no time was the second line of a couplet short. Lower down (I, v, 63), we have “Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone,” where Q omits all but “let him alone.”"

These happy masks, I believe, means no more than the happy masks. Such is Tyrwhitt’s opinion. Knt. It seems scarcely necessary to limit the use of masks to the female spectators of the play. In the Two Gentlemen of Verona we have the “ sun-expelling mask.” In Love’s Labour’s Lost the ladies wear masks in the first interview between the king and the princess : “ Now fair befall your mask,” says Biron to Rosaline. Del. Such masks as the ladies of Sh.’s time were wont to wear when they went out in the street. Dyce (ed. 2) [in a note on Mea. for Mca. II, iv, 79]. As to “these black tnasksT Tyrwhitt, in his earlier days, conjectured that Sli. alluded to “ the masks of the audience when the play was acted at court;” but he afterwards repudiated that most extravagant conjecture. “ My notion at present,” he says, “ is that the phrase, these black masksy signifies nothing more than black viasksy according to an old idiom of our language, by which the demonstrative pronoun is put for the ])repositive arti- cle.” So we have in the present play [Mea. for Mea.], IV, i, 59: “volumes of report Run with these fiilse and most contrarious quests.” And compare Webster, The Duchess of Malfiy V, ii “We that are great women of pleasure use to cut off These uncertain wishes and unquiet longings And in an instant join the sweet delight And the pretty excuse together.” (I cannot but feel surprised that Tyrwhitt’s discarded conjecture, about these masui meaning the masks of the audience, should have been brought forward by Halliwell as a probal)le one, and that he should conceive it to be supported by a passage (to which he only refers) at the conclusion of Fletcher’s Beggar's Bush, where Higgen, speaking the epiloguey says to the “ladies,” “If you be pleas’d, look cheerJy, throw your eyes Out at your masks.”) Clarke.

The meaning of this somewhat complex passage seems to be: She is rich in the possession of unequalled beauty, but poor, because having devoted herself to chastity, when she dies her wealth, that is beauty, dies with her. The same conceit occurs repeatedly in Shakespeare’s poems; see cited Sonnets and examples. White. Romeo means to say that his mistress is only poor in that, at her death, her store — i. e. the beauty that she is rich in — will die with her, and that so her chief wealth is a possession that she cannot bequeath. Dyce (ed. 2). “The sense required, as is clear from Benvolio’s rejoinder, and even from Malone’s note, in which he defends the old reading, is that her beauty dies with her; but this sense cannot be squeezed out of the old text; therefore Theobald’s conjecture is necessary.” Lettsom.

So Sidney: “Oh I he is marr’d, that is for others made I” Spenser uses it very often. [Sing. lluds, Hal. Sing. (ed. 2) to the foregoing citations adds : “You’re to be marred or marryed, as they say.

The generalization is done to the poet’s hand. Here you have the garrulity of age strengthened by the feelings of a long-trusted servant, whose sympathy with the mother’s affections gives her privileges and rank in the household. And observe the mode of connection by accident of time and place, and the childlike fondness of repetition in a second childhood, and also that happy—humble ducking under, yet constant resurgence against, the check of her superiors.

(See Stowe’s Chronicle and Gabriel Harvey’s Letter in the Preface to Spenser’s Works, ed. 1679.) If so, one may be permitted to conjecture that this play, or this part of it, at least, was written in 1591, after the 6th of April, when the eleven years since the earthquake were completed, and not later than the middle of July, a fortnight and odd days before Lammas- tide.

        "Mal.: since the earthquake] Mal. (Vol. II, p. 350). Sh.’s frequent allusions to the manners and events of his own time have shown me that Tyrwhitt’s conj. is not so improbable as I once thought it. Sh. might have laid the foundation of this play in 1591 and finished it at a subsequent period. If the earthquake, which happened in England in 1580, was in his thoughts and induced him to state the earthquake at Verona as happening on the day when Juliet was weaned, and eleven years before the commencement of the piece, it has led him into a contradiction; for, according to the Nurse, Juliet was within a fortnight and odd days of completing her fourteenth year; and yet, according to the computation, she could not well be much more than twelve years old. Whether, indeed, the English earthquake was or was not in his thoughts, the Nurse’s account is inconsistent and contradictory. Perhaps Sh. was more careful to mark the garrulity than the precision of the old woman; or perhaps he meant this very incorrectness as a trait of character; or, without having recourse to either of these suppositions, shall we say that he was here, as in some other places, hasty and inattentive?",
        "Knt.: since the earthquake] Knt. The principle of dating from an earthquake, or from any other remarkable phenomenon, is a very obvious one. We have an example as old as the days of the prophet Amos; “The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel, in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.” But it is by no means improbable that Sh. might have been acquainted with some description of the great earthquake which happened at Verona in 1348, when Petrarch was sojourning in that city; and that, with something like historical propriety, therefore, he made the Nurse date from that event, while at the same time the supposed allusion to the earthquake in England in 1580 would be relished by his audience.",
        "Collier: since the earthquake] Collier (ed. i). In the whole speech of the Nurse there are such discrepancies as render it impossible to arrive at any definite conclusion, even if we suppose that Sh. intended a reference to a particular earthquake in England. First, the Nurse tells us that Juliet was in the course of being weaned; then that she could stand alone; and, thirdly, that she could run alone. It would have been rather extraordinary if she could not, for even according to the Nurse the child was very nearly three years old. No fair inference can, therefore, be drawn from the expression, and we coincide with Malone that the tragedy was probably written towards the close of 1596.",
        "Hunter: since the earthquake] Hunter (New Illustr.). It will not be denied that Sh. might make an Italian in an Italian story allude to an event that occurred in London; but the whole argument is of the most shadowy kind, and it seems to be entirely destroyed when the fact is introduced that in 1570 there did occur a most remarkable earthquake in the neighborhood of Verona, so severe that it destroyed Ferrara, and which would form long after an epoch in the chronological calculations of the old wives of Lombardy. When the church of St. Stephen at Ferrara was rebuilt, an inscription was placed against it, from which we may collect the terrible nature of the visitation: “Cum anno M.D.LXX die XVII Novembris tertia noctis hora, quam maximus terrae motus hanc praeclarissimam urbem ita conquassasset, ut ejus fortissima moenia, munitissimas arces, alta palatia, religiosa templa, sacratas turres, omnesque fere sedes omnino evertisset et prostrasset, una cum maximo civium damno, atque acerba clade.” The order of towers, palaces and temples in this inscription coresponds to the order in which they occur in the well-known passage in The Tempest. Will this come in aid of the argument of those who contend that Sh. must, at some period of his life, have breathed the air of Italy, seen the Italian palaces and witnessed the Italian customs he has so accurately exhibited? This inscription appears to have been cut in 1571, or not long after. At all events, I submit, that, if we must suppose that the poet intended to make the Nurse speak according to the truth of history at all, this is the earthquake to which she alludes, and not the slight trembling which alarmed the fears of a northern people unaccustomed to such phenomena. The argument of Tyrwhitt’s has, however, run the course of all the editions. [Dyce, Sta.]",
        "Sta.: since the earthquake] Sta. There is a small tract still extant, entitled “A coppie of the letter sent from Ferrara the xxii of November, 1570. Imprinted at London in Paules Churchyarde at the signe of the Lucrece, by Thomas Purfoote” in which the writer describes “the great and horrible earthquakes, the excessiue and vnrecouerable losses, with the greate mortalitie and death of people, the mine and ouerthrowe of an infinite number of monasteries, pallaces, and other howses, and the destruction of his graces excellencies castle.” The first earthquake was on Thursday, the 11th, at ten at night, “whiche endured the space of an Aue Marie;” on the 17th, “the earth quaked all the whole day.” In all, “the earthquakes are numbered to haue been a hundred and foure in xl houres.”",
        "Clarkk.: since the earthquake] Clarkk. That Sh. alluded to the earthquake of 1580 we think most probable; but that the allusion particularizes the period when the event occurred in connection with the writing of the play, we doubt. Sh. would not, we think, thus register a particular so subject to fluctuation as a date; for what would be an eleven years’ interval when he wrote might become a twelve years’ interval when the play was put upon the stage, and would certainly become an altogether inaccurate interval by the time the play had been performed during many seasons. It appears to us that the “eleven years” in this line is simply a step by which the old Nurse helps herself to retrace the age of her foster- child.",
        "Dyce (ed. 2): since the earthquake] Dyce (ed. 2). If it be unlikely, as I think it is, that our poet had a view to the earthquake in his own country during 1580, it is still more unlikely that he should have alluded to that in Italy during 1570.

In some of the provinces, a man of wax means now-a-days “a smart, cleverish fellow;” vide Moor’s Suffolk Words and The Dialect of Craven; but assuredly Sh. does not employ the expression in that sense. [In a note on a sea of wax [T. of A., I, i, 50], Dyce has the following: Dr. Ingleby has put forth a brochure: The Still Lion, &c., Being part of the Shakespeare-jahrbuch, ii, wherein he gives, with astonishing confidence, entirely new glosses of “a sea of wax” and “a man of wax”—his attempt to show that Sh. employs a substantive wax in the sense of “expandedness or growth” vying in absurdity with any of the misinterpretations that ignorance and conceit have ever tried to force upon the great dramatist. [Dr. Ingleby says]: “‘A man of wax’ is a man of full growth. Of Falstaff [2 Hen. IV: I, ii, 149] it would mean a man of ample dimensions; of Romeo it means a man of puberty, “a proper man.” It seems inconceivable that Dr. Ingleby should have so grossly misunderstood these words in Romeo and Juliet. I add a passage which is decisive as to the true meaning of “a man of wax:” “A sweet face, an exceeding daintie hand; A body, it framed of wax By all the cunning artists of the world. It could not better be proportioned.”—Faire Em., &c., sig. B. ed."

This passage furnishes a very remarkable example of the correctness of the principle laid down in Whiter’s very able tract: “An Attempt to explain and illustrate various Passages of Sh. on a new Principle of Criticism, derived from Locke’s Doctrine of the Association of Ideas,” wherein the leading doctrine, as applied to Sh., is, that the exceeding warmth of his imagination often supplied him, by the power of association, with words, and with ideas, suggested to the mind by a principle of union unperceived by himself, and independent of the subject to which they are applied. We readily agree with Whiter that “this propensity in the mind to associate subjects so remote in their meaning, and so heterogeneous in their nature, must, of necessity, sometimes deceive the ardour of the writer into whimsical or ridiculous combinations. As the reader, however, is not blinded by this fascinating principle, which, while it creates the association, conceals likewise its effects, he is instantly impressed with the quaintness, or the absurdity, of the imagery, ana is inclined to charge the writer with the intention of a foolish quibble or an impertinent allusion.” It is in this spirit of a cold and literal criticism, here so well described, that Monck Mason pronounces upon the passage before us,—“this ridiculous speech is full of abstruse quibbles.” Put the principle of association, as explained by Whiter, at once reconciles us to the quibbles. The “volume” of young Paris’s face suggests the “beauty’s pen,” which hath “writ” there. Then, the obscurities of the fair “volume” are written in the “margent of his eyes,” as comments of ancient books are always printed in the margin. Lastly, this “book of love” lacks “a cover;” the “golden story” must be locked with “golden clasps.” The ingenious management of the vein of imagery is, at least, as remarkable as its “abstruce quibbles.”"

Ulr. In my opinion, the prosaic severall would be decidedly preferable to the hyper-poetical and far-fetched “married” (especially as the thought that the features were in harmony is distinctly expressed in the next verse), if the whole speech of Lady Capulet were not so full of plays upon words and strained comparisons. That Sh. puts in the mouth of Juliet’s mother such, so called, Euphuisms is certainly not without a deep design. She is distinguished by the style and matter of her speech as a highly cultivated, but in truth an artificial, woman of the world of that day, of considerable address, but without feeling, without heart or soul, who thinks more of fashionable elegance of manners, social advantage, &c., than of true inner worth, and is, therefore, more devoted to the world than to the care and education of her daughter.",

Their entry on these occasions was always prefaced by some speech in praise of the beauty of the ladies or the generosity of the entertainer; and to the prolixity of such introductions allusion is here made.

But with state, Mercutio’s words show, from the first, that vision of the Queen in her state progress which he sees already in his mind’s eye, and which he is about to describe. Instead of an incongruous simile inserted between ‘she comes—drawn,’ we have ‘she comes drawn in state by little atomies,’ where, through the intervention of state, the word drawn applies to the compound idea of herself and her conveyance, and prepares us for her ‘waggon-spokes.' ... the comparison is to the agate-ring of an alderman, because it is the state of a lesser than a Lilliput magnate compared with that of a large-sized Brobdingnagian, the size of the essential part of the signet as compared with the whole pomp of a full-blown alderman clad in civic robes and carried in a cumbrous civic coach.",

The Belemnites, or elf-stones, were regarded as charms against the last- mentioned disease, and against evil spirits of all kinds; but the cerauniae or brontiae, and all perforated flint stones, were not only used for the same purpose, but more particularly for the protection of horses and other cattle, by suspending them in stables, or tying them round the necks of the animals."

Skinner says it is 'quasi dicas massa panis,' i. e., a mass of bread. Lye derives it from the Dutch, in which, besides marcepeyn, which he considers as a corruption, there is massereyn, which means pure bread; 'but this is not very satisfactory. In mediaeval Latin they were called martii panes, which gave occasion to Hermolaus Barbarus to make some inquiry into their origin in a letter to Cardinal Piccolomini, who had sent some to him as a present. Politian's Epistles, Book xii. Balthasar Bonifacius says that they were named from Marcus Apicius, the famous epicure: \"Ab hoc Marco, panes saccharo concliti vulgo etiamnum dicuntur Marci panes, vel potius ab alio quodam juniore, M. Gavio Apicio, qui sub Augusto et Tiberio fuit ad omne luxus ingenium minime, &c.\" Fabric. Bibl. Lat., ed. Ernest., vol. ii., p. 468. Minshew will have them originally sacred to Mars, and stamped with a castle, which is nearly the opinion of Hermolaus. Whatever was the origin of their name, the English receipt-books all show that they were composed of almonds and sugar, compounded and baked. Here is a specimen: Ta make a marchpane.—Take two poundes of almonds being blanched, and dryed in a sieve over the fire, beate them in a stone mortar, and when they bee small mixe them with two pounde of sugar beeing finely beaten, adding two or three spoonefuls of rosewater, and that will keep your almonds from oiling; when your paste is beaten fine, drive it thin with a rowling pin, and so lay it on a bottom of wafers, then raise a little edge on the side, and so bake it, then yce it with rosewater and sugar, then put it in the oven againe, and when you see your yce is risen up and drie, then take it out of the oven and garnish it with prettie conceipts, as birdes and beasts, being cast out of standing mouldes. Sticke long comfits upright in it, cast bisket and carrowaies in it and so serve it; guild it before you serve it; you may also print of this marchpane paste in your moldes for banqueting dishes. And of this paste our comfit makers at this day make their letters, knots, armes, escutcheons, beasts, birds and other fancies. Delightes for Ladies, 1608, lamo. Sign. A la.

      "play": "It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night",
      "notes": [
        "It seems] Steev.: It seems] Sh. has the same thought in his 27th Sonnet: 'Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night, Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.' Knt.: It seems] Why then, it may be asked, do we depart from our usual principle and reject an undoubted ancient reading? Because the reading which we give has become familiar, has passed into common use wherever our language is spoken, is quoted in books as frequently as any of the other examples of Sh.’s exquisite power of description. Here, it appears to us, is a higher law to be observed than that of adherence to the ancient copies. Coll. (ed. i): It seems] We adhere to the authentic, and perfectly intelligible, text, as contained in every impression during the author’s life. Del.: It seems] Juliet’s beauty is only first spoken of in line 45. The boldness of the simile led the poet to introduce it by 'it seems.' Ulr.: It seems] The reading of F1 is an improvement, although it has no authority, and is therefore not to be adopted. The succeeding phrase, ‘Beauty too rich,’ seems to demand that a similar word should precede it. On the other hand, it weakens the otherwise very bold and almost forced image of hanging on the cheek of night. Corn.: It seems] Her beauty is now so consecrated by general approval that it would be both useless and ungracious to attempt to supersede it. The most rigid sticklers for the authority of F1 have found it necessary, in very many cases, to prefer the readings of the Qq, and in some comparatively few instances those of F1. The reason is this: we know, unfortunately, as far as the matter is susceptible of proof, that none of Sh.’s plays were published under his own superintendence; we know also, in reference to all the earlier copies, that typographical errors, stage omissions or interpolations, the want of regular editing, and other causes, have contributed to obscure, and, not unfrequently, to destroy the poet’s meaning; it is, therefore, in no irreverent spirit (as is too often inculcated), but rather from a feeling of duty and gratitude, that even the most cautious commentators have felt themselves compelled to depart from the principle of taking anyone edition as an invariable guide. From two or three instances selected in the present play from numerous others, merely as illustrations of the general fact, it will be seen that the reviser, who should in every case adopt the readings of F1, would bring upon his devoted head the merited anathema of every Shaksperian reader. We have not, however, presumed to vary from the text without anxious consideration and constant reference to those commentators who have shown the least disposition to innovate either as to words or versification. Verp.: It seems] So much is gained in poetic beauty by the reading of F1, and the other reading is so tame in expression, and so little in Sh.’s manner, whose faults of language are never on that side, that it seems quite probable that this was a correction of the poet’s own, obtained from some other MS., altered during the poet’s life. It is, besides, confirmed by the repetition of the word ‘beauty’ in line 45. Dyce (ed. i): It seems] The reading of F1, however it may be regarded as an improvement, has not a shadow of a claim to be received into the text. Coll. (ed. 2): It seems] The usual reading of F1 has been tame and poor. White.: It seems] The great gain in poetic beauty by the reading of F1 does not justify a deviation from the authoritative text, though it may tempt to it. But in this passage all the old copies come evidently from one source; and in this play, as in some others, the authority of the folio is impaired, although its authenticity as a whole cannot be impeached; while in the context there is ground for believing that the editor of the second folio—a contemporary of Shakespeare—restored the true reading. Steevens might have put the case much more strongly: for in line 45 'beauty' is a dependent word, and the clause which begins with it an entirely dependent clause. Unless 'beauty' occur in the first clause of the sentence as the apponent of 'beauty' in the second, the latter cannot be construed, I will not say according to grammatical rule and precedent, but so as to preserve that rational coherence of thought, the necessity of which underlies all grammatical rules, and which Sh., in his freest style, never violates. Therefore, having this contemporary change of a reading which, if undisturbed, would leave a unique and derogatory blemish upon Sh.’s page,—a change, too, which seems not to add a grace, but to preserve one by the mere restoration of grammatical integrity to the passage,—I believe that the elder copies have in this case, as in some others, but perpetuated an error committed in the earliest impression, and I adopt the reading of F1, not upon the authority of that text, but upon the internal evidence of the context, supported by the inherent merits of the emendation. All editors of the present century have hitherto deferred to the authority of the elder copies. Dyce (ed. 2): It seems] The reading of F1 (whencesoever the editor of that folio may have procured it) is assuredly a great improvement. Gerald Massey (Sh.’s Sonnets, &c., Lond. 1866, p. 470): It seems] I fancy that Sh. was working a good deal from the life and the love of his friends [Southampton’s love for Elizabeth Vernon] when he wrote this play; the Queen’s opposition to their marriage standing in the place of that ancient enmity of the two Houses. There is much of Southampton’s character and fate in Romeo the unlucky, doomed to be crossed in his dearest wishes, whose name was writ in sour Misfortune’s book. ... There are expressions pointing to the lady of the early Sonnets as being in the poet’s mind when he was thinking of Juliet. A remarkable image in the 27th Sonnet is also made use of in Romeo’s first exclamation on seeing Juliet for the first time. Considering who the Sonnets were written for, this figure reappears in too pointed a way not to have some suggestive significance. Looked at in this light, the question of Juliet, ‘Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?’ comes upon us with luminous force; for the fact is, that Southampton was a Montague by the mother’s side, she being Mary, daughter of Anthony Browne, fair Viscount Montague, which fact calls to mind what has always seemed a little bit of the Nurse’s nonsense in II, iv, 19c [which see]. Clarke.: It seems] Inasmuch as the expression of the authentic copies is not only intelligible, but is one that Sh. has used elsewhere, we feel bound to retain it. In other passages of description we find ‘it seems’ and ‘it seem’d’ thus used; Tempest, I, ii; Lear, IV, iii, and Winter’s Tale, V, ii."

        "cock-a-hoop] Nares.: cock-a-hoop] Cock-on-hoop, or cock-a-hoop. The derivation of this familiar expression has been disputed. See Todd. I can add one example of its being used as if to mark profuse waste, by laying the cock of a barrel on the hoop, ‘The cock-on-hoop is set, Hoping to drink their lordships out of debt.’ Honest Ghost, p. 26. Ben Jonson also seems to show that he so understood it, and his authority is of weight. As an example of the preposition of by which he there means off he gives this: ‘Take the cock of [off] the hoop.’ Engl. Gram. ch. vi. But it must be owned that the usage is not always consistent with that origin. Knt.: cock-a-hoop] The origin of this phrase, which appears always to be used in the sense of hasty and violent excess, is very doubtful. According to Nares the uninterrupted flow of the ale led to intemperance. Sta.: cock-a-hoop] a phrase of very doubtful origin. I rather suppose it to refer in some way to the boastful, provocative crowing of the cock, but can find nothing explanatory of its meaning in any author. White.: cock-a-hoop] The notion [which has been advanced by Nares] seems to me puerile. It is better to confess ignorance than to be content with such caricature of knowledge. May not the phrase have been originally ‘cock-a-whoop’? the fitness of which phrase to express arrogant boasting is plain enough. Dyce (ed. 2): cock-a-hoop] Ray gives ‘To set cock on hoop,’ and remarks: ‘This is spoken of a Prodigal, one that takes out the spigget, and lays it upon the top [or hoop] of the barrel, drawing out the whole vessel without any intermission.’ Proverbs, p. 183, ed. 1768. Gifford (Note on Jonson's Works, vol. vi, p. 226): cock-a-hoop] describes it as ‘a phrase denoting the excess of mirth and jollity,’ and ‘suspects that it had a more dignified origin’ than that just quoted from Ray. But it also was applied, as in our text, to insolence of language or bearing; and accordingly Coles (who seems to refer it to the bird cock) has ‘To be Cock-a-hoop, Ampullari, insolesco, cristam erigere'—Lat. and Eng. Dict. In N. and Qu., 2d Ser., vol. v, p. 426, the phrase ‘to sit cock in the hoop’ is cited by ‘P. P.’ from Philpots' Remains."

        "pilgrim] Halliwell.: pilgrim] The subjoined engraving, from a sketch by Inigo Jones, presents us with the Palmer’s, or Pilgrim’s, dress worn by Romeo in this scene. It is the usual costume of such personages, consisting of a long loose gown, or robe, with large sleeves, and a round cape covering the breast and shoulders; a broad-leafed hat, turned up in front and fastened to the crown by a button, apparently, if it be not intended for a small cockle-shell, the absence of which customary badge would otherwise be the only remarkable circumstance in the drawing. In the left hand of the figure is the bourdon, or staff, peculiar to pilgrims. The modern representatives of Romeo have inaccurately carried a cross. In the text of the play the only indication of his being in a Pilgrim’s habit is derived from Juliet’s addressing him, ‘Good Pilgrim,’ &c. The drawing is therefore most interesting authority for the actor; and it is probable that Mercutio, Benvolio, and the ‘five or six maskers’ were also attired in similar dresses, as at this period the parties attending such entertainments appeared generally in sets of 6 or 8 shepherds, wild-men, pilgrims, or other characters, preceded by their torch-bearers, music, and sometimes, as Benvolio intimates, ‘a cupid hoodwinked with a scarf,’ &c., or some other allegorical personage, to speak a prologue, or introductory oration, setting forth the assumed characters and purpose of the maskers.

        "[Kissing her.] Rowe.: [Kissing her.] Malone. Sh. here, without doubt, copied from the mode of his own time; and kissing a lady in a public assembly, we may conclude, was not thought indecorous. In King Henry VIII, he, in like manner, makes Lord Sands kiss Anne Boleyn, next to whom he sits at the supper given by Cardinal Wolsey. White (Sh. Scholar): [Kissing her.] I have never seen a Juliet upon the stage who appeared to appreciate the archness of the dialogue with Romeo in this scene. They go through it solemnly, or, at best, with staid propriety. They reply literally to all Romeo’s speeches about saints and palmers. But it should be noticed that, though this is the first interview of the lovers, we do not hear them speak until the close of their dialogue, in which they have arrived at a pretty thorough understanding of their mutual feeling. Juliet makes a feint of parrying Romeo’s advances, but does it archly, and knows that he is to have the kiss he sues for. He asks, ‘Have not saints lips and holy palmers too?’ The stage Juliet answers with literal solemnity. But it was not a conventicle at old Capulet’s. Juliet was not holding forth. How demure is her real answer: ‘Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use—in prayer!’ And when Romeo fairly gets her into the corner, towards which she has been contriving to be driven, and he says, ‘Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged,’ and does put them to that purgation, how slyly the pretty puss gives him the opportunity to repeat the penance by replying, ‘Then have my lips the sin that they have took!’"

        "Dyce (Few Notes etc., p. 109, 1853): Adam/Abraham] In Soliman and Perseda, 1599, we find: ‘the eldest Sonne of Pryam, That aub-coloured Troion?’ Sig. H 3. In Middleton’s Blurt, Master Constable, 1602: ‘A goodlie, long, thicke; Airam-colour’d beard.’ Sig. D. And in Coriolanus, II, iii, according to : ‘not that our heads are some browne, some blacke, some — there being hardly any reason to doubt that in these passages ‘abraham’ (or ‘Abram’) is a corruption of ‘abron’—i. e., ‘auburn.’ Is then the right reading in the present line, ‘Young abram [or auburn] Cupid,’ Sh. having used ‘abram’ for ‘auburn-haired,’ as the author of Soliman and Perseda has used ‘abraham-coloured Trojan’ for ‘Trojan with auburn-coloured hair?’ Everybody familiar with the Italian poets knows that they term Cupid, as well as Apollo, ‘Il biondo Dio;’ and W. Thomas, in his Principal Rules of the Italian Grammer, &c., gives ‘Biondo, the aborne [i.e., auburn] colour, that is betwene white and yelow.’ ed, 1567. In The Two Gent., IV, iv, 194, ‘auburn’ means yellowish.",
        "Dyce (ed. i): Adam/Abraham] That here ‘Abraham’ is merely a corrupted form of ‘auburn’ I now feel more confident than when I made the foregoing note.",
        "Coll. (ed. 2): Adam/Abraham] This [Dyce’s note] is, indeed, to use Mr. Dyce’s own strong words (Remarks p. 167), to ‘chronicle a wretched conjecture,’ for where, in English, is Cupid called ‘auburn Cupid’?",
        "Dyce (ed. 2): Adam/Abraham] Mr. Grant White estimates my conjecture very differently,—he adopts it.",
        "White: Adam/Abraham] That ‘Abraham’ is a mere error, or, rather, superfluous and mistaken sophistication of ‘abram,’—itself one of the numerous modes of spelling ‘auburn’ of old,—seems undeniable. ‘Auburn’ was spelled auburne, aubome, aubrun, abeme, abron, abrun, abran, abram, and (consequently) sometimes Abraham. See the following instances: ‘Her black, browne, aubume, or her yellow hayre.’—Drayton’s Moone Calf, p. 164, ed. 1627. ‘Light auborne, subfavus’—Baret’s Alvearie, 1580. ‘He’s white hair’d. Not wanton white, but such a manly colour Next to an aubrun.’— Two Noble Kinsmen, IV, ii. ‘And on his Abron head hore haires peerd here and there among.’—Golding’s Ovid, fol. 157 b.,ed. 1587; fol. 151 b., ed. 1612. ‘They [persons of sanguine temperament] are very hairy; their head is commonly abran, or amber coloured; so their beards.’— Optick Glass of Humours, 1630, p. I16.",
        "Halliwell: Adam/Abraham] The idea of Adam Cupid in this [Upton’s] sense seems forced. The form [abraham for auburn] is certainly met with in our old writers. ‘By the eleventh house you can judge of what haire he shall be of, of a browne or Abraham colour, as the English; of a yellow, as the Dane.’ Melton's Astrologaster, 1620.",
        "Ktly.: Adam/Abraham] I incline to the reading, first given by Upton, with an allusion to Adam Bell, and I think there may be another to Adam, the first man; for Sh. may have known that in classic mythology Love was the first of beings. There would be humor, then, in ‘young Adam’ denoting the union of youth and age."

        "Mal.: beggar-maid] The ballad here alluded to is ‘King Cophetua and the Beggar-maid,’ or, as it is called in some old copies, 'The Song of a Beggar and a King.’ The following stanza Sh. had particularly in view: ‘The blinded boy that shoots so trim, From heaven down did hie, [‘so high,’ Coll. (ed. 1).] He drew a dar: and shot at him. In place where he did lie.’ [Sing, Coll, Verp. Huds. Nares. The song is extant in Percy’s Reliques, vol. i, p. 198, and is several times alluded to by Sh. and others. The name of the fair beggar-maid, according to that authority, was Zenelophon, but Dr. Percy considered that as a corruption of Penelophon, which is the name In the ballad. ... It has been conjectured that there was some old drama on this subject, from which, probably, the bombastic lines spoken by Ancient Pistol were quoted: 2 Hen. IV : V, iii, 100, 101. The worthy monarch seems to have been a favorite hero for a rant.",

Upon the authority of learned Master ‘Moth,’ in Love’s Lab. L., I, ii, 114, it was an ancient ballad in Sh.’s day. We have two versions of this ballad; the one in ‘A Collection of Old Ballads’ quoted by Grey in 1754’ (ed. 2.)], the other in Percy’s Reliques. Both of these compositions appear as if they had been ‘newly writ o’er’ not long before, or, perhaps, after Sh.’s time. [A stanza of each is subjoined by Knight.] Ed.",
        "Cambr.: beggar-maid] Pope was the first commentator who called attention to the ballad which is alluded to in this passage, and it is remarkable that, with all his partiality for (Q,), he did not adopt the reading ‘trim,’ found both there and in the ballad. Percy, in a note to the ballad printed in his Reliques, conjectured that Sh. had written ‘trim,’ not ‘true,’ apparently without knowing that the word was found in (Q,). Capell, in his note, says that he had retained ‘true’ in his text, owing to his not having observed the authority for the other reading.",

But Pope rejected these lines,—Pope who, in the Rape of the Lock, has introduced one couplet, at least, that would have disgraced the age of Elizabeth. We do not print the two lines of Sh., for they can only interest the verbal critic. But we distinctly record their omission. As far as we have been able to trace,—and we have gone through the old eds. with an especial reference to this matter,—these two lines constitute the only passage in the original eds. which has been omitted by modern edd. With this exception there is not a passage in Sh. which is not reprinted in every ed. except that of Bowdler’s. And yet the writer in Lardner’s Cyclopcedia (Lives of Literary and Scientific Men) has ventured to make the following assertion: ‘Whoever has looked into the original editions of his dramas will be disgusted with the obscenity of his allusions. They absolutely teem with the grossest improprieties,— more gross by far than can be found in any contemporary dramatist.’ The insinuation that the original editions contain improprieties that are not to be found in modern editions is difficult to characterize without using expressions that had better be avoided.",
        "Del. (Lexikon'): laugh alone] These lines, which are perfectly in keeping with Mercutio’s character, and are to be found in all the old eds., have hurt, the delicacy of some of the English critics to such an extent, that the latter have omitted them from the text, which without them is unintelligible, in order thereby to give them the greater prominence in their notes.

[Notes and Emend.] ‘White and green’ had been the royal livery in the reign of Henry VIII, but Elizabeth changed it to scarlet and black; and although motley was the ordinary dress of fools and jesters, it is capable of proof that, earlier than the time of Sh., the fools and jesters of the court (and perhaps some others) were still dressed in ‘white and green’; thus it became proverbially the livery of fools. Will Summer (who lived until 1560, and was buried at Shoreditch on the 15th of June of that year) wore 'white and green,’ and the circumstance is thus mentioned in ‘Certain Edicts of Parliament,’ at the end of the edition of Sir Thomas Overbury’s ‘Wife,’ in 1614: ‘Item, no fellow shall begin to argue with a woman, &c., unless he wear white for William and green for Summer’—that is, unless he be a fool like Will Summer. In Fox’s ‘Acts and Monuments,’ iii, 1 14, a story is told of a person, who, noticing the colors in which St. John had been painted by the Papists in St. Paul’s, said, ‘I hope ye be but a Summer's bird, in that ye be dressed in white and green.' Skelton wore ‘white and green’ because he was the royal jester, though he also assumed the rank of laureat. In the time of Sh. it may have been discontinued as the dress even of court fools, but it may have been traditionally so considered.",

But it has hitherto been adopted without question, I believe, and the variation of texts has remained unnoticed. The compositor appears to have been confused by a reminiscence of the epithets applied to the moon in the third line above, and perhaps also by a passing thought of green-sickness which they suggested, and so repeated the first instead of the second of those epithets. Collier (MS.) offers a violent though specious change, which is made entirely unnecessary by the reading of (Q,), and which yet gives an independent support to that reading. So also does Macbeth, I, vii, 37.",

Our old stage, in spite of its lack of scenery, permitted this scene to be played with a very exact likeness to reality. Juliet could appear at the window, which opened on the balcony at the back of the stage, draw the curtain, and, after pausing a few moments, as a girl would naturally do under the circumstances (during which her lover might, though feeling sure, be unable to see surely, who it was), step out upon the balcony. And so it doubtless was represented, and should now be. For this gives a meaning to Romeo’s exclamations, ‘It is my lady; O, it is my love!’ which seem somewhat superfluous, to say the least, if Juliet bolts right out when Romeo's attention is first attracted by the light from her window, according to modern custom on the stage and the supposition of modern texts.

        "Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.",
        "Verp. Huds. Sta.: I. Rom.] It has been disputed whether Romeo, overhearing Mercutio’s banter, refers to that, or to his having believed himself, before he saw Juliet, so invincible in his love for Rosaline, that no other beauty could move him. We feel no doubt that the allusion is to Mercutio; indeed, the rhyme in found and wound seems purposely intended to carry on the connection of the speeches; and at this moment Rosaline is wholly forgotten.",
        "White: I. Rom.] In the Qq and Ff, from the beginning of this Act to the entrance of the Friar, there is not the slightest implication of a supposed change of scene, but rather the contrary; and the arrangement in question [Rowe’s] seems to have been the consequence of an assumption that Benvolio's remark (II, i, 5) is made on the outside of the wall; whereas the text rather implies that the whole of this Act, from the entrance of Romeo to his exit after his interview with Juliet, passes within garden; for after the stage direction, Romeo alone (which has a like particularity in all the old copies), Romeo says, ‘Can I go forward while my heart is here?’—not in the street, or outside the wall, but here, the dwelling-place of his love, which is before his eyes. After he speaks the next lines, the old copies (from the absence of scenery) could not direct him to ‘climb the wall and leap down within it, but, had he been supposed to do this, some intimation would have been given that he was to go out of eye-shot of Mer. and Benv.; as, for instance, in Love’s Lab. L., where (IV, iii) Birone is supposed to mount a tree, we have the direction, ‘He steps aside.’ But in the present case nothing of the kind appears, even in the notably particular indications of (Q,). Again, Benvolio's remark that Romeo ‘hath hid himself among these trees’ must surely be made within the enclosure where Romeo is, unless we suppose Benv. able to see farther into a stone wall than most folk can; while what he previously says about this orchard wall means merely the wall of this orchard (as in Romeo's after speech, line 66 ), and implies no particular nearness of the barrier. Finally, in QqFf we find that the last line of Benvolio's last speech and the first of Romeo's soliloquy make a rhyming couplet, and are printed together without any direction for the entrance of Romeo. Therefore I have felt obliged to vary from the previous modern arrangement of this Act, and to make but one Scene of what has been made by other editors two. It has also been the custom hitherto to direct Juliet to appear before Romeo's exclamation at seeing the light. I have a purpose in making him see the light (as he naturally would) before he sees Juliet, which, to those who share my appreciation of the passage, will excuse what may seem to others a trifling, if not a needless, change."

At Belmont the silver light of the moon fell upon a pair not unhappily united; here it falls on an impassioned youth in the hour of his proudest exultation, soon to be followed by deepest anxieties, misery and death. Such is life!",

Compare this scene with The Tempest, III, i.

There seems more passion in the one, and more dignity in the other; yet you feel that the sweet girlish lingering and busy movement of Juliet, and the calmer and more maidenly fondness of Miranda, might easily pass into each other."

        "To lure this tassel-gentle back again!",
        "Steev.: tassel-gentle] The tassel or tiercel (for so it should be spelt) is the male of the gosshawk; so called because it is a tierce or third less than the female. This is equally true of all birds of prey. This species of hawk had the epithet gentle annexed to it, from the ease with which it was tamed, and its attachment to man. In the Booke of Falconrye, by George Turberville, Gent., 1575, I find a whole chapter on the falcon-gentle, &c. So in The Guardian, by Massinger: “then for an evening flight, A tiercel-gentle I.” Taylor, the Water poet, uses the same expression: ‘by casting out the lure, makes the tassell gentle come to her fist.’ Again in Spenser’s Fairy Queen, b. iii, c. iv: 'Having far off espyde a tassel-gent.’ In Decker’s Match me in London, 1631: ‘Your tassel-gentle, she’s lur’d off and gone.’ Mal. It appears that certain hawks were considered as appropriated to certain ranks. The tercel-gentle was appropriated to the prince, and thence was chosen by Juliet as an appellation of her beloved Romeo, In an ancient treatise entitled ‘Hawking, Hunting, and Fishing, with the True Measures of Blowing,’ is the following; ‘For a Prince, There is a falcon gentle, and a tercel gentle; and these are for a prince.’ Nares. This species of hawk was no less commonly termed a falcon-gentle—so called, says the Gentleman's Recreation, ‘for her familiar, courteous disposition.’ Sing. Tardif, in his book of Falconry, says that the tiercel has its name from being one of three birds usually found in the aerie of a falcon, two of which are females, and the third a male, hence called tiercelet or the third.",
        "Clarke.: falconer’s voice] The falconer’s voice was the voice which the hawk was constrained by habit to obey. Gervase Markham, in his ‘Country Contentments,’ has picturesquely described the process of training hawks to this obedience, 'by watching and keeping them from sleep, by a continual carrying of them upon your fist, and by a most familiar stroking and playing with them, with the wing of a dead fowl, or such like, and by often gazing and looking them in the face with a loving and gentle countenance.' A hawk so 'manned’ was brought to the lure 'by easy degrees, and at last was taught to know the voice and lure so perfectly that, either upon the sound of the one or the sight of the other, she will presently come in, and be most obedient,' The sport with a tassel-gentle is spiritedly described by Massinger: '—Then for an evening flight A tiercel-gentle, which I call, my masters, As he were sent a messenger to the moon. In such a place flies, as he seems to say, See me or see me not! the partridge sprung. He makes his stoop; but wanting breath, is forced To canceler; then, with such speed as if He carried lightning in his wings, he strikes The trembling bird, who even in death appears Proud to be made his quarry.' White. ‘There is a fawkon gentyll and a tercell gentyll. And these be for a prynce.’ —Juliana Berners, Dyce. Properly tiercel-gentle, the male of the goshawk. (‘Tiercelet. The Tassell or male of any kind of Hawke, so tearmed, because he is, commonly, a third part less than the female.’— Cotgrave’s Fr. and Engl. Diet. ‘Tiercell, Tercell, or Tassell is the general name for the Male of all large Hawks.’—R. Holmes’s Academy of Armory and Blazon, B. ii, c. xi, p. 240.)"

The beautiful lines given to the Friar are introduced for the sake of repose; but in the choice of the topic in these seven lines the Poet seems to have had a further view. Poison is hereafter to become a main agent in the piece, and the Poet prepares the audience for the use of poison by familiarizing them, in the early portion of the play, with the idea, and thus preparing them to witness the use of it without being so much shocked as they would be were no such preparations made. This is not the only passage in the earlier scenes in which poison is spoken of. The epithet ‘rude,’ applied to the will, is not open to much objection, but it appears to have been suggested to the Poet’s mind by a singular process, of which there are other instances. The words ‘herb’ and ‘grace,’ occurring together, introduced into his mind the idea of the plant called herb of grace, and this brought with it its other name, ‘rue,’ and ‘rue’ suggested ‘rude.’"

        "M. Mason: physic lies] M. Mason. This is one of the passages in which our author has sacrificed grammar to rhyme. Knight: Knt. Mason’s observation is made in the same spirit in which he calls Romeo’s impassioned language ‘quaint jargon.’ Before Sh. was accused of sacrificing grammar, it ought to have been shown that his idiom was essentially different from that of his predecessors and his contemporaries. [Knight here quotes Percy and Toilet as cited by Ulrici in the Prologue.] Malone has rightly stated the principle upon which such idioms, which appear false concords to us, should be corrected; that is, “to substitute the modern idiom in all places except where either the metre or rhyme renders it impossible.” But to those who can feel the value of a slight sprinkling of our antique phraseology, it is pleasant to drop upon the instances in which correction is impossible. We would not part with the exquisite bit of false concord, as we must now term it, in the last word of the four following lines for all that Sh.’s grammar-correctors have ever written: ‘Hark! hark! the lark at heaven’s gate sings, And Phœbus ’gins arise. His steeds to water at those springs On chalic’d flowers that lies.’ Sing. Sh. must not be tried by rules which were invented after his time. We have the same grammatical construction in Venus and Adonis, 1128: ‘Where two lamps burnt out in darkness lies.’ Again in I, iv, 91 of this play. Delius: By a Shakespearian license, the singular verb lies follows the plural both our remedies; not only because the two singular nouns help and physic separate the verb from its subject, but because the plural, remedies, arose from its connection with both, and both our remedies is in reality a singular—the remedy of both of us. Thus in All’s Well, I, iii, 'both our mothers'—the mother of both of us. Also in Cymbeline, II, ii: ‘both your wills'—the will of both of you. White: The apparent want of grammatical agreement here is the result neither of ignorance nor oversight. [In a note on Cymbeline, II, iii, 21.] The disagreement in number between ‘lies’ and its nominative is not worth all that has been written about it. A relic of an old usage, it was common enough in Sh.’s day."

It seems to us that in depicting both the characters to whom he has given the name of Rosaline, Sh. had some special living woman before his mind’s eye as their prototype. The few vivid lines with which he has touched in the sketch of Romeo’s Rosaline, unseen as she is in the play, accord perfectly with the recurrent delineations and more elaborated portrait of Biron’s Rosaline in ‘Love’s Lab. L.’ It is a subject of extremely interesting investigation, for so little is to be gathered of a personal nature from Sh.’s dramatic writings—he, like a perfect dramatist, merging self entirely in the characters he draws—that every indication, however slight, by which we may obtain a glimpse of himself or those he knew, is most valuable. Viewed by the light afforded from Massey’s ‘Sh.’s Sonnets, &c.,’ the woman who was the original for the portrait in ‘Love’s L. L.’ and the sketch here (both of them ‘Rosalines’) should be Lady Rich: but, however the truth may be with regard to her individual identity, we have a firm belief that she was an actual woman known to Sh. in the life."

        "Knight: duellist] George Wither, in his obsequies upon the death of Prince Henry, thus introduces Britannia lamenting: ‘Alas! who now shall grace my tournaments, Or honour me with deeds of chivalrie?’ The tournaments and the chivalrie were then, however, but 'an insubstantial pageant faded.' Men had learnt to revenge their private wrongs without the paraphernalia of heralds and warders. In the old chivalrous times, they might suppress any outbreak of hatred or passion, and cherish their malice against each other until it could be legally gratified; so that, according to the phrase of Richard Coeur-de-Lion, in his ordinance for permitting tournaments, ‘the peace of our land be not broken, nor justice hindred, nor damage done to our forests.' The private contests of two knights were a violation of the laws of chivalry. Chaucer has a remarkable exemplification of this in his ‘Knight’s Tale,’ where the Duke, coming to the plain, saw Arcite and Palamon fighting like two bulls, and says: ‘But telleth me what mistere men ye been, That be so hardy for to fighten here Withouten any judge or other officer, As though it were in listës really’ (royally). That duels were frequent in England in the reign of Elizabeth, we might collect, if there were no other evidence, from Sh. alone. The matter had been reduced to a science. The degrees in quarreling were called the causes; and these have been most happily ridiculed by Sh. in As You Like It, V, iv, 63-77. When Touchstone alludes to ‘the book,’ he refers to the works of Saviolo and Caranza, who laid down laws for the duello. The wit of Sh. is the best commentary upon the philosophy of Montaigne: ‘Inquire why that man hazards his life and honour upon the fortune of his rapier and dagger; let him acquaint you with the occasion of the quarrel, he cannot do it without blushing, ’tis so idle and frivolous.' (Essays, book iii, ch. 10.) But philosophy and wit were equally unavailing to put down the quarrelsome spirit of the times; and Henry IV of France in vain declared all duellists guilty of lèse-majesté, and punishable by death; and James I of England as vainly denounced them in the Star-Chamber. The practice of duelling went on with us till the civil wars came to merge private quarrels in public ones. Burton, in his ‘Anatomy of Melancholy,’ has a bitter satire against the nobility, when he says, they are ‘like our modern Frenchmen, that had rather lose a pound of blood in a single combat than a drop of sweat in any honest labour.’"

        "Staunton: first house, &c.] Mercutio’s mockery is not directed against the practice of duelling in the abstract, for he appears to be almost as pugnacious as the fiery Tybalt himself. He is ridiculing the professors and alumni of those academies established in London during the latter part of the 16th century for the study of ‘The Noble Science of Defence,’ as it was called,—a class who appear to have prided themselves on the punctilious observance of certain forms and an affected diction, which had been rendered fashionable by the treatises of Saviolo [Practise of the Duello, Vine. Saviolo, 1595] and Caranza. The most obvious meaning of the words, ‘A gentleman of the very first house,’ appears to be that Tybalt was a gentleman-scholar ‘of the very first house’ or school of fencing of the greatest teacher existing at the period. In George Silver’s Paradoxes of Defence, Lond., 1599, it is stated that there were three ‘Italian Teachers of Offence;’ the first of whom was Signior Rocco, who had come into England thirty years before. ‘He disbursed a great summe of mony for the lease of a house in Warwicke-lane, which he called his college, for he thought it a great disgrace for him to keepe a fence-schoole, he being then thought to be the only famous maister of the arte of armes in the whole world.’ ‘He taught none commonly under twentie, forty, fifty or an hundred pounds.’ To be, therefore, a gentleman of such a house as this, was really ‘a very ribband in the cap of youth.’ In the same tract occurs a curious illustration of another expression in the same speech of Mercutio: ‘the very butcher of a silk button.’ ‘One Austen Bagger, a verie tall gentleman of his handes,’ resolved to encounter Signior Rocco, and went to another house which he had in the Blackfriars, ‘and called to him in this manner; “Signior Rocco, thou that art thought to be the only cunning man in the world with thy weapons; thou that takest upon thee to hit any Englishman with a thrust upon anie button ... I am come to fight with thee.”’ To Warburton’s explanation Steevens objects that both Capulet and Romeo preceded Tybalt in genealogical rank; but the truth is that neither of them at all interfered wdth such claim, Romeo was of the house of Capulet only by marriage with Juliet; and in the List of persons represented in the tragedy, Tybalt is called Nephew to Lady Capulet, The real heraldical reference, if that be the genuine sense of the passage, appears to have been quite overlooked. When the bearing of armorial ensigns became reduced to a science, a series of differences was instituted, the more readily to distinguish between the arms borne by the several sons and descendants of the same family, and to show their order and consanguinity. They consisted of six small figures, called a label, crescent, mullet, martlet, annulet, and fleur-de-lis, which were always to be placed in the most prominent part of the coat-armour. These signs, borne singly, were for the sons of the original ancestors, who constituted that which heralds denominated ‘the First House!’ the issue of those sons formed ‘the Second House,’ and carried their differences doubled, beginning with the crescent surmounted of a label, a crescent of a crescent, and so of the rest. It was ordained by Otho, Emperor of Germany, that the eldest son of the first member of the first house should be preferred in dignity before his uncle; and the same regulation was also established in France, and made to include females. Tybalt was, therefore, the eldest son of Lady Capulet’s elder brother, and, without pretending to be at the head of his family, was still a gentleman descended of ‘the very first house.’"

Blue eyes, properly so called, appear even to have been accounted ugly, since Sh. speaks of Sycorax as a ‘blue-eyed hag.’ Mercutio means to say that in Romeo’s 'opinion Thisbe to his lady was indeed ‘grey-eyed’ (pretty-eyed), or something of that sort, but on the whole *insignificant.’ Not to the purpose is, does not belong to the subject, does not matter, therefore trifling.",

        "Douce: ropery] The word seems to have been deemed unworthy of a place in our early dictionaries, and was probably coined in the mint of the slang or canting crew. It savours strongly of the halter, and appears to have been signified a low kind of knavish waggery. From some other words of similar import it may derive illustration. Thus a rope-rype is defined in Hulôt’s Abecedarium to be ‘an ungracious waghalter, nequamp’ and in Minshew’s dictionary, ‘one ripe for a rope, or for whom the gal-lows grones.’ A roper has nearly the same definition in the English vocabulary at the end of Thomasii Dictionarium, 1615; but the word occasionally denoted a crafty fellow, or one who would practise a fraud against another (for which he might deserve hanging). So in the book of blasoning of arms or coat- armour, ascribed to Dame Juliana Berners, the author says, ‘which crosse I saw but late in tharmes of a noble man ; the which in very dede was sometyme a crafty man, a roper, as he himself sayd,’ sig. Aij. b. Roper had also another sense, which, though rather foreign to the present purpose, is so quaintly expressed in one of our old dictionaries that the insertion of it will doubtless be excused; ‘Roper, restio, is he that looketh in at John Roper’s window by translation, he that hangeth himselfe.’—Hulôt’s Abcedarium Anglico-Latinum, 1552, fo.",

        "Staunton: ropery] That is, ribaldry.",
        "White: ropery] ‘Ropery,’ ‘rope ripe’ and ‘rope-tricks' were all used with humourous reference to acts deemed worthy of hempen expiation; and these, in Sh.’s time, included almost every violation of public order or the laws of property."

        "skains-mates] M^l. This means, I apprehend, cut-ihroat companions. [‘ Possibly,’ Coll. ‘ Probably,’ Cham, Steev. a skein, or skain, was either a knife or a short dagger. By skains- viates the Nurse means his loose companions who frequent the fencing-school with him, where we may suppose the exercise of this weapon was taught. Green, in his Quip for an Upstart Courtier, describes ‘ an ill-favoured knave, who wore by his sifle a skeine like a brewer’s bung-knife.* Skein is the Irish word for a knife, \\_Sing, (ed. i), Corn, lluds. Douce. The objection to these interpretations is, that the Nurse could not very well compare herself with characters which it is presumed would scarcely be found among females of any description. One commentator [M. Mason] thinks that she uses skains-mates for kins-maies, but the existence of such a term may be questioned. Besides, the Nurse blunders only in the use of less obvious words. The following conjecture is therefore offered, but not with entire confidence in its propriety. It will be recollected that there are skeins ofthread, so that the good nurse may perhaps mean nothing more than sempstresses, a word not always used in the most honorable acceptation. She had before stated that she was * none of his flirt-gills.’ \\^Hal. Warner. I rather take it to mean one who assists in winding off a skein of silk, for it must be done by two ; and I am told these are at this time, among the weavers in Spital- fields, looked upon as the lowest kind of people, \\llal, Nares. a companion of some sort, from the term mate ; but Mercutio and the Nurse could not well be mates, either in sword play or in winding skains of silk. I am inclined to think that the old lady means ‘ roaring or swaggering companions.’ Coll. (ed. l). Skene is used by many writers of the time. R. Armin, in his ‘Nest of Ninnies,’ 1608 (reprinted by the Sh. Society), has this passage; ‘ If I do stick in the bogs, help me out—not with your good skene head me,* Dyce {* Remarks,^ &c.). This interpretation [Collier’s approval of Malone] can- not be right, because the Nurse is evidently speaking of Mercutio’s female companions. The meaning of skains-mates (if not a misjrint, which I suspect it is) remains to be discovered. [Sing. (ed. 2), subs. Huds. [Malone’s interpretation and Dyce’s objection quoted]. We do not quite see how this should be decisive. Coll. (ed. 2). [Dyce’s remark quoted that female associates are alluded to]. Just the contrary ; for she has already referred to his female companions as * flirt-gills.* She means that she is no companion of his, whether female or not. Walker. Read ‘ scurvy-umtes ;’ see context. Scurvy, in the old plays, is written indiscriminately with an sc or an sk, a ^ or an ie; see this very passage. Skuruie might easily be mistaken for skaines by an eye like that of a printer ; perhaps, too, the intrusive final s (Art. xxxviii) may have crept in here; though there is no need of calling in its assistance. Sta. This has been a sore puzzle to all the commentators. The difficulty, after all, proves of easy solution. The word skain, I am told by a Kentishman, was for- merly a familiar term in paits of Kent to express what we now call a scape-grace or tie' eY'do-well ; just the sort of person the worthy old Nurse would entertain a horror of being considered a companion to. Even at this day, my informant says, skain is often heard in the Isle of Thanet and about the adjacent coast, in the sense of a reckless.^ dare-devil sort of fellow. [ White, Vyce (ed. 2), Clarke. Cham. The skeen-dubk, or black knife, is common in Ireland and the Highlands."

The second speech of Meicutio, line 4, is at best only half mythmical. At the end of this scene, when the jesting speeches end, Romeo uses verse again, the Nurse comes in with prose, Romeo keeps on in verse, and now the Nurse falls partly into it, rises to a trivial rhyming proverb (which she turns upside down), but soon falls back into her prosaic tattle. In like manner in III, i, we find prose and verso alternating, accord- ing as the more elevated, or the more common, tone is meant to preponderate. It is indeed very doubtful, in my judgment, whether Romeo’s speech. III, i, 80-84, was not meant as prose."

        "dog’s name] Ward. The Nurse, who, we must suppose, could not read, thought Romeo had mocked her, and says : ‘No, sure, I know better; our dog’s name is R, yours begins with another letter.’ This is natural enough and in character. Rput her in mind of that sound which is made by dogs when they snarl, R in schools being called The dog's letter. Ben Jonson, in his English Grammar, says : R is the dog's letter, and hirreth in the sound. [Sing. Knt. Corn. Verp. Iliids. Clarke.] • Irritata canis quod R. R. quam plurima dicat.’ Lucil. [Sing. Huds. Farmer. The dog’s letter is exemplified in Barclay’s Ship of Fools, 1578: ‘This man malicious, which troubled is with wrath, Nought els souudeth but the hoorse letter R. Though all be well, yet he none aunswere hath Save the dogges glowming with nar, nar.* \\Sing. Huds. Sta. Hal. Clarke. Douce. Erasmus, in explaining the adage ‘ canina facundia,* says ; ‘ R. litera quae in rixando prima est, canina vocatur.’ [Knt. Perp.] I think it is used in this sense more than once in Rabelais ; and, in the Alchemist, Subtle says, in making out Abel Drugger’s name ; ‘ And right anenst him a dog snarling er.' [Stng. Ritson. Tyrwhitt’s alteration is certainly superior to either Warburton’s or Dr. Johnson’s,—not but the old reading is as good, if not better, when properly regulated. [Del, Todd. The following is an illustration of dogs from Nash’s Summer's Last Will and Testament, 1600: ‘They arre and barke at night against the moone.’ [Sing. Knt. Verp. Huds. Clarke. Nares. There is good classical authority for calling R the dog’s letter, though Warburton has quoted a verse from Lucilius that does not exist. The verse really is Irritata canis quod, homo quam, planiu* dicit. It alludes, indeed, to the letter R, but does not introduce it. Persius also says : Sonat hjec de n .re canina litera. But the idea has been 'aken up in all ages, and must have been very familiar in Sh.’s time, or he would not have put it into the mouth of the old Nurse, whom the context shows to be unable to .spell. Sh. would find it in the commonest books of his time. His friend Jonson’s Grammar was not published perhaps in his life- time ; but he might have heard from him, in conversation, that ‘ R is the dog's letter and hurreth in the sound.’ Or he might have studied the curious rebus in the Alchemist (ii, 6) on Abel Drugget’s name. Knt. In Holland’s translation of Plutarch’s Morals : * a dog is, by nature, fell and quarrelsome, given to arre and war upon a very small occasion.’ Colt., (ed. i). The meaning o. this passage seems to have been hitherto mistaken, owing Lo * thee’ in the old copies (as was often the case) having been misprinted the. The Nurse means to ask, ‘ how can R, which is the dog’s name, be for thee ?' And she answers herself, *No; I know Romeo begins with some other letter.* The modern text has u.sually followed the sugge.stion of Tyrwhitt ; but no change is neces- sary beyond the mere alteration of the to ‘ thee.’ It is singular that this trifling change should not have been suggested before long ago’ (cd. 2)]. [ Verp, Dyce {^Remarks &c., p. 1 71). Collier is not aware that the ‘trifling change* which he has made here was not only proposed by Warburton, but, at his suggestion, inserted in the text by Theobald. I think it quite wrong ; ‘ R for thee ?’ being by no means a simple or natural mode of putting the question. The strong probability is, that the word ‘ dog’ (as Tyrwhitt conjectured) hf.s dropt out from the text. Ulr. It is to me very doubtful whether the foregoing emendation [Warburton’s] is the true one or not, for the reason that the Nurse has always hitherto addressed Romeo as ‘ you and the sudden transition to the * Thou’ appears wholly purposeless, I am more inclined to suspect a misprint in ‘ no,’ and instead thereof would read ‘ dog,’ as Tyrwhitt conjectures ; but then drop the ‘ no’ before which Tyrwhitt inserts * dog.’ Del. Ritson’s emendation, which only changes the punctuation of the old text, is the most plausible. White. Collier more reasonably supposes that * the’ was printed for ‘ thee,’ which often happened. Dyce. Even in the days of the Romans, R was called the dog's letter, from its resemblance in sound to the snarling of a dog. Lucilius alludes to it in a fragment which is quoted with various corruptions by Nonius Marcellus, Charisius, and Donatus on Terence, and which Joseph Scaliger amended thus : ‘ Irritata canes quod, homo quim, planiu’ dicit’ (‘ canes’ being the nom. sing, fern.) ; and Pensius has ‘ Sonat hie de nare canina T.itera,’ sat. i, 109. Ben Jonson, in his English Grammar^ says that F ‘ Is the dog's letter, and hurreth in the sound ; the tongue striking the inner with a tremliling about the teeth.* lVorl:Sy vol. ix, p. 2S1, ed. Gifford; and various passages to the same effect might be cited from our early authors. Gerai.I) Massey {^Sk.^s Sonnets^ &c., London, 1866, p. 471). Now, here is more meant than, meets the eye. The Nurse is being used. There is something that she does not quite fathom, yet her lady does. She is prettily wise over a pleasant con ceit. Romeo understands it, too, if we may judge by his judicious answer. The Nurse, however, knows there is another letter involved. There is a name that begins with a different letter to the one sounded ; but this name is not in the Play, therefore it cannot be Rosemary, which the Nurse knows does not begin with an * R.* Name and letter have to do with^ Romeo; the lady sees how, but the Nurse, who started to tell the lover a good joke about Juliet’s playing with his name, is puzzled in the midst of it; can’t make it out exactly, but it’s a capital joke, and it would do his heart good to see how it pleases the lady, who is learned in the matter, though she, the Nurse, be no scholar ! We shall find a meaning for the first time if Southampton be the original of Romeo, and make sense of the Nurse’s nonsense by supposing, as we well may, that here is an aside on the part of the Poet to his friends, and that the name which begins with another letter than the one first sounded is Wriothesley ! This bit of Sh.’s fun has perplexed his commentators most amusingly ; their hunt after the Dog and the * dog’s letter R’ being the best fun of all. The only ‘ dog’ in the Nurse’s mind is that * mocker’ of herself, the audacious lover of her young lady. Romeo has put her out of reckoning by saying ‘ both with an R.* And the Nurse, with the fiimiliarity of an old household favoiite, and a chuckle of her amorous old heart, says ; ‘ Ah you dog, you, “ R” is for “ Rosemary” and also for—noy there's some other lottery and my lady knows all about it;’ only she says this half to herself, as she tries to catch the missing meaning of her speech, the very point of her story. ‘Rosemary’ is merely the herb of that name. ^That's for remembrance’ with Juliet, not for the name of a dog ! The second Dog is Tyrwhitt’s, not Sh.’s. In the present instance the Poet is using the Nurse for the amuse- ment of his friends, just as he uses Mrs. Quickly and Dogberry for ours ; that is, by making ignorance a dark reflector of light for us; causing them to hit the mark of his meaning for us whilst missing it for themselves ; thus we are flattered and they are befooled. Clarke. We think that the Nurse is made to say * the dog’s name’ instead of ‘ the dog’s letter,’ partly because Sh. has a mode of using a popularly known phrase and giving it a touch of his own peculiar fashion, partly because it gives an effect of blunder and confusion to the old woman’s diction here, and partly because the word * name’ thus introduced forms the antecedent to ‘ it’ in the next clause of the sen- tence : ‘ I know it begins with some other letter’—meaning ‘ the name I am thinking of,—Romeo.’"

For ‘pale’ we should probably read dull. See Timon, II, i, 228. We have elsewhere (Merc, of Ven., II, vii, 8) ‘dull lead.’ Moreover, lead is not pale, and the Nurse would seem to have been rather a jolly, rubicund sort of woman. If fare be the right reading, it would almost require dull. On the other hand we have in Chaucer (Tr. and Cr., ii): ‘With asshen pale as lede,’ and (Dream) ‘That pale he wax as any lede.’"

        "Steev.: Scene vi.] This was entirely new-formed after the first copy. [Sing, Knt, Colt Huds, White (Introd. p. 22). The traces of another hand than Sh.’s that have attracted my attention in (Q1) are not many, but they seem to me unmistakable. The first that I noticed is this entire Scene. It will be observed that the variations in (Q1) from the later version are of the most material nature; or rather .that the whole Scene was rewritten, and but a few lines of the earlier version was retained. The change made upon the revision was not in all respects for the better. In the Friar’s second speech the line, ‘So light a foot ne’er hurts the trodden flower,’ contains a daintier and more graceful, and therefore it would seem, a more appropriate, figure than, ‘so light a foot Will ne’er wear out the everlasting flint,’ although the three lines that follow these last have a fancy and a rhythm peculiarly Shakspearian; and again, in Juliet’s reply, ‘I am, if I be day. Come to my sun: shine forth, and make me fair,’ has a touch of poetry more exquisite and more dramatic than is to be found in the rewritten scene, which, unmistakably Sh.’s, is not Sh.’s best. Of the remainder, lines 1026-1033, 1044, 1045, of (Q1) will, I think, hardly be attributed to Sh. at any period of his career, by readers of discrimination, who are well acquainted with his works and those of his elder contemporaries. They are too tame, feeble, and formal, both in rhythm and sense, to have ever been written by him for the stage."

Accordingly, Gervinus preaches moderation to Romeo—very properly, doubtless; Friar Lawrence does so too. But had Romeo minded the lesson, there would have been no impassioned youth, nor would Love have been represented in the Drama in all its power, its infinitude. At another time one may bethink himself that there are other things besides Love in the world,—reflection, duty,—but here and now the divinity of Love is the thing; this it is that is to be represented, an ideal passion. Even here there is, besides this passion, the world without, and it is the duty of the lover, doubtless, duly to consider it. It is wrong, and not wrong, in Romeo, that, in the impetuosity of his passion, he forgets it. It is in this twilight that tragedy has place."

And the noun conceit, which survives with a limited meaning (the conception of a man by himself, which is so apt to be one of over-estimation), is also frequent in Sh. with the sense, nearly, of what we now call conception, in general. Sometimes it is used in a sense which might almost be said to be the opposite of what it now means; as when Juliet [in this passage] employs it as the term to denote her all-absorbing affection for Romeo; or as when Gratiano, in the Mer. of Ven., I, i, 90, speaks of a sort of men who ‘do a wilful stillness entertain, With purpose to be dress’d in an opinion Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit’ that is, deep thought. So, again, when Rosaline, in Love’s Lab., II, i, 72, speaking of Biron, describes his ‘fair tongue’ as ‘conceit’s expositor,’ all that she means is, that speech is the expounder of thought. The scriptural expression, still in familiar use, ‘wise in his own conceit,’ means merely wise in his own thought, or in his own eyes, as we are told in the margin the Hebrew literally signifies. In the New Testament, where we have ‘in their own conceits,’ the Greek is simply παρ’ εαυτοῖς (in or with themselves)."

        "Warburton: pilcher] We should read pilche, which signifies a cloak or coat of skins, meaning the scabbard. [Singer, Hudson, Steevens.] This explanation is, I believe, just. Nash, in Pierce Penniless, 1592, speaks of a carman in a leather pilche, [Singer (ed. 1), Hudson, Clarke.] Again, in Decker's Satiromastix, 1602: \"I'll beat five pounds out of his leather pilch.\" Again, \"Thou hast forgot how thou ambled'st in a leather pilch, by a play-waggon in the highway, and took'st mad Jeronimo's part, to get service among the mimicks.\" It appears from this passage that Ben Jonson acted the part of Hieronimo in the Spanish tragedy, the speech being addressed to Horace, under which character old Ben is ridiculed. [Halliwell.] Nares: a scabbard [Nares.] from pylche, a skin-coat, Saxon. See Skinner. Singer (ed. 2): There has been a vain attempt to make Pilcher signify a leathern sheath, because a Pilch meant a leathern coat or pelt. It is quite evident that in this jocose, bantering speech Mercutio substitutes Pitcher for Scabbard. The poet was familiar with the proverb \"Pitchers have ears,\" of which he has twice availed himself. The ears, as every one knows, are the handles, which have since been called the lugs; pitcher was suggested by the play upon the word ears, which is here used for hilts in the plural, according to the usage of the poet’s time. [Staunton.] Staunton: a pilch was the name for some outer garment made of leather [\"Pierce Penniless,\" 1592, cited], and the word might be applied suitably enough for the leathern sheath of a rapier. Perhaps we should read, \"out of his pilch, sir,\" &c. Collier (ed. 2): No other instance has been adduced of the use of this word in this way in any other author. [Verplanck, White.] Very likely the last syllable was accidentally added by the printer, and that Mercutio said, \"Pluck your sword out of his pilch.\" [Ulrici, Dyce.] Dyce: a scabbard, a sheath. Keightley: I think the right word is pilche, a leathern coat. In V, i, 202, the sheath of a dagger is termed its house."

        "Farmer: grave man] This jest was better in old language than it is at present. Lidgate says, in his elegy upon Chaucer: \"My master Chaucer now is grave.\" [Singer, Halliwell.] Steevens: We meet with the same quibble in The Revenger's Tragedy, 1608, where Vindice dresses up a lady's skull and observes; \"she has a somewhat grave look with her.\" [Staunton, Halliwell.] Malone: In Sir Thomas Overbury's Description of a Sexton, Characters, 1616: \"At every church-style commonly there's an ale-house; where let him bee found never so idle- pated, hee is still a grave drunkard.\" [Singer, Staunton, Halliwell.] Coleridge (Lit. Rem. vol. II, p. 156, ed. 1836): How fine an effect the wit and raillery habitual to Mercutio, even struggling with his pain, give to Romeo's following speech, and at the same time so completely justifying his passionate revenge on Tybalt! [Staunton.] In Italy the funeral follows close upon death; and it was so formerly in England too; hence poor Mercutio's quibble [Clarke], and the fact of the narcotic administered to Juliet being tempered to operate only \"two and forty hours,\" are strictly in keeping with the usages of the period. Hallam (\"Lit. of Europe\"): It seems to have been necessary to keep down the other characters that they might not overpower the principal one; and though we can by no means agree with Dryden, that if Shakespeare had not killed Mercutio, Mercutio would have killed him, there might have been some danger of his killing Romeo. His brilliant vivacity shows the softness of the other a little to a disadvantage. [Verplanck.] Verplanck: Perhaps Hallam has hit upon the true reason, for it is worthy of note that the death of Mercutio is wholly the Poet's own invention. It does not come from the poem or novel, where there is merely an accidental contest between the Capulets and Montagues, whom Romeo, endeavoring to part, is assailed by Tybalt, and kills him in self-defence, not in anger for the murder of a friend."

To this purpose I remember I have heard a certeine pretie apothegue [apothegme] uttered by a jester to a king. The king had pardoned one of his subjectes that had committed murther, who, being pardoned, committed the like offence againe, and by meanes was pardoned the second time also, and yet filling up the measure of his iniquitie, killed the third, and being brought before the king, the king being verie sorie, asked him why he had killed three men, to whom his jester, standing by, replied, saieing, No (O King) he killed but the first, and thou hast killed the other two; for if thou hadst hanged him up at the first, the other two had not beene killed; therefore thou hast killed them, and shall answere for their bloud.

But there was a still further refinement, that if the cockatrice first saw the person, he killed him by it; but if the animal was first seen, he died.

        "Knt.: God save the mark] The commentators leave the expression in Its original obscurity. May we venture a conjecture? The mark which persons who are unable to write are required to make, instead of their signature, is in the form of a cross; but anciently the use of this mark was not confined to illiterate persons, for amongst the Saxons the mark of the cross, as an attestation of the good faith of the person signing, was required to be attached to the signature of those who could write, and to stand in the place of the signature of those who could not write. (See Blackstone’s Commentaries.) The ancient use of the mark was universal; and the word mark was, we believe, thus taken to signify the cross. God save the mark was, therefore, a form of ejaculation approaching to the character of an oath; in the same manner as assertions were made emphatic by the addition of ‘ by the rood,* or, * by the holy rood.* White. (Q,) has ‘God save the sample P May we conclude from this that, in the other phrase, * mark’ means such a mark as is made with a needle upon a sampler? Dyce.

Why could not Juliet have gone with him? and, by so doing, have prevented the after evils, which originate solely in their apparently needless separation. Brooke’s poem supplies the hiatus. Juliet there supplicates her lover for his permission to be his companion in exile. But he gives her the reasons why this cannot be: * For, but thou chaneje thy myiule, (1 do foretell the end) Thou shall undoo thyselfe for aye, and me thy trusty frende. For why, thy .absence knowne, thy father wil be wroth, And in his rape no [so] narowly he will pursue us both, That we shall trye in vayne to scape away by flight, And vainely seeke a loorking place to hide us from his sight.

Flies may do this, but I from this must flie: They are freemen, but I am banished.' The same order is followed in the subsequent Quartos. The reading of (Q₂) will be seen in the reprint which follows the play. The F₁ gives: 'This may Flics doe, when I from this must flie. And saist thou yet, that exile is not death? But Romeo may not, hee is banished.' This reading is followed by the other Folios, Rowe, Theobald, Warburton, and Johnson [Knight, Singer (ed. 2). Ed.]. Hanmer follows Pope in his text (see foregoing note), omitting altogether the lines which Pope put in the margin. Capell has: 'Flies may do this, but I from .his must fly; They are free men, but I am banished.' STEEVENS (1773) reads: 'Flies may do this, when I from this must fly; They are free men, but I am banish'd. And say'st thou yet, that exile is not death? But Romeo may not:—he is banish'd.' In his note on the passage, in the edition of 1778, he conjectured that the line 'But Romeo ... banished' should be inserted after 'their own kisses sin,' an arrangement which was adopted by Malone, and by Steevens himself in his ed. of 1793. Capell suggests that the lines he retains 'were second thoughts of the poet's, and their original was meant for expunction.' This may possibly be true, but we have adopted the reading given in our text because it retains, without manifest absurdity, lines which are all undoubtedly Sh.'s. [So far the Cambridge Editors.] Variorum of 1821, Har. Sino. (ed. l), Camp. Corn, and Delius follow Steevens of 1793. Coll. (ed. l) [also Verp. Ulr.]. We follow and Q₄. In F₁, the impassioned repetition of 'Flies may do this, but I from this must fly,' was, it would seem, not allowed for, and that and the following line were, therefore, as we think, unnecessarily omitted. Dyce (Remarks, &c.). Collier supposes that Sh. would make Romeo utter the very same conceit twice over in the course of a few lines. The repetition is nothing more than one of the innumerable varia lectiones of this tragedy. The line 'But Romeo may not,' &c., is quite out of place. In such a passage as this, where hideous confusion has arisen from the various readings, it is absolutely necessary that an editor should do his endeavor to rectify that confusion: he should neither jumble two texts together, nor slavishly follow one particular text. Ulr. As it is characteristic of passion to delight in a repetition of the same words while indulging in a variety and abundance of images and conceits, I should have omitted these lines [41, 42], which contain a repetition of the same conceit merely, if F₁ had also omitted the preceding line, 'But Romeo may not.' If these lines be retained, which continue the simile of flies, the two following are, in my opinion, also necessary. Either the latter have been omitted, or the former retained through oversight. Hazlitt omits lines 40-42, But...banished. Hudson, Dyce, Chambers, Keightley adopt F₁ and transpose the line 'But Romeo may not,' &c., to follow 'Still blush, as thinking,' &c. Sta. [adopts F₁ and transposes 'But Romeo,' &c., to follow 'This may flies do,' &c.] Capell rightly conjectures that the author's first draft of this passage was left standing in the MS., and so got printed with the after version. Coll. (ed. 2) [adds to his former note]: There is manifestly some confusion in the text, but as by leaving out the lines we might exclude something which Sh. at one time inserted, we rather leave them as a reduplication than strike them out as interpolated. White follows Steevens of 1793 in the arrangement of lines, but adopts from QqFf line 41, and in a note says: 'that the new lines, \"But Romeo may not,\" &c., and \"They are freemen,\" &c., were added in the wrong places seems so clear that I have not hesitated to regulate the text accordingly.' Halliwell and Clarke follow Staunton. Cambr. follows White, except in reading but for ‘when’ in line 41."

The Friar, therefore, instead of joining in the lamentations of the others, would be much more likely to repress them. Ulr.: It is far from being out of character for the Nurse to interlard her talk with some few grand, high-sounding phrases, which she had caught up in her long intercourse with the higher ranks, especially with Lady Capulet. My view is also sustained by the word predicament, which only half and half applies here, inasmuch as it only exceptionally, and under certain circumstances, signifies the same as situation (La^e), and even in this sense does not exactly suit the connection.

In which his joyes had been so scant, and sorowes aye so ryfe; The time and place of byrth he fiercly did reprove, He cryed out (with open mouth) against the starres above,— On Fortune eke he raylde.' Sh. copied the remonstrance of the Friar without reviewing the former part of his scene. He has, in other places, fallen into a similar inaccuracy by sometimes following and sometimes deserting his original. [Sing. Sta. White.] Ulr.: It is true Sh. appears to have followed here the source of his plot a little too closely, but the oversight is not so great as the English critics assume; it can be very readily supposed that before the scene opens Romeo had done what Laurence now reproaches him with. White.: The omission in (Q₁) of seventeen lines in this speech is due, without a doubt, to the hasty and surreptitious manner in which that edition was published, and not to the addition of them upon the revision of the play. For the supposition that Sh., when, after years of mental developement, he revised the early version of this tragedy, began his labour in this passage by finishing a sentence, and then, for the sake of sixteen lines, went helplessly back again to Brooke's old poem, and, taking it up where he before dropped it, led off by versifying a sentence inconsistent with what he had before written, is too absurd to merit a second thought."

Malone says, ‘When the citizens of Angiers are to appear on the walls of their town, and young Arthur to leap from the battlements, I suppose our ancestors were contented with seeing them in the balcony already described, or perhaps a few boards tacked together and painted so as to resemble the rude discolored walls of an old town, behind which a platform might have been placed near the top, on which the citizens stood.’ It appears to us probable that even in these cases the balcony served for the platform, and that a few painted boards in front supplied the illusion of wall and tower.... According to Malone, when a play was exhibited within a play, as in Hamlet, the court, or audience, before whom the interlude was performed, sate in the balcony, [Ibid.] We prefix a representation of the old stage with its balcony engraved in the title-page to Alabaster’s Latin Tragedy of Roxana, 1632.",

Then Lady Capulet comes sweeping by, with her train of velvet, her black hood, her fan and rosary—the very beau-ideal of a proud Italian matron of the fifteenth century, whose offer to poison Romeo, in revenge for the death of Tybalt, stamps her with one very characteristic trait of the age and the country.

        "not so green] Steev. Perhaps Chaucer has given to Emetrius, in The Knight’s Tale, eyes of the same colour : ‘ His nose was high, his eyin bright citryn i, e., the hue of an unripe lemon or citron. Again, in The Two Noble Kinsmen, by Fletcher and Sh., V, i : ‘ oh vouchsafe With that thy rare green eye,’ &c. [HudsI^ I may add that Arthur Hall (the most ignorant and absurd of all the translators of Homer), in the fourth Iliad, 1581, calls Minerva ‘The greene eide Goddese.’ \\_Sing. Douce. Besides the authorities already produced in favor of green eyes, and which show the impropriety of Ilanmer’s alteration to keeUf a hundred others might, if necessary, be given. The early French poets are extremely fond of alluding to them under the title of yeux vers^ which Mons. Le Grand has in vain attempted to convert into yeux vairs^ or grey eyes. It must be confessed that the scarcity, if not total absence, of such eyes in modern times might well have excited the doubts of the above intelligent and agreeable writer. For this let naturalists, if they can, account. It is certain that green eyes were found among the ancients. Plautus thus alludes to them in his Curculio: ‘Qui hie est homo Cum collativo ventre, atque oculis kerbeis /’ Lord Verulam says, ‘ Great eyes with a green circle between the white and the white of the eye signify long life.’ Hist, of Life and Deaths p. 1 24. Villa Real, a Portuguese, has written a treatise in praise of them, and they, are even said to exist now among his countrymen. See Pinkerton’s Geography, vol. i, p. 556. \\_Sing. Hal. Coll. (ed. 2). These citations unquestionably establish the point. * Huds. Lord Bacon says that * eyes somewhat large, and the circles of them in- clined greenness are signs of long life.’ \\Clarke. Dyce. 'Green eyes were considered as peculiarly beautiful. , . . The Spanish writers are peculiarly enthusiastic in the praise of green eyes. So Cervantes, in his novel El Zeloso Estremeiio: “ Ay que ojos tan grandes y tan rasgados ! y por el siglo de mi madre, que son verdes^ que no parecen sino que son de esmeraldas.” ’ (Weber), Gifford, after observing that he has * seen many Norwegian seamen with eyes of this hue, which were invariably quick, keen, and glancing,* and that the expression 'green eyes' is common in our early poets, cites the following Sonnet by Drummond of Hawthirnden; ‘When Nature now had wonderfully wrought All Auristella’s parts, except her eyes, To make these twins two lamps in beauty's sxies She counsel of the starry synod (v. 1. “ her starry senate**) sought. Mars and Apollo first did her advise To wrap in colours black those comets bright, That Love him so might soberly disguise, And, unperceived, wound at every sight Chaste Phoebe spake for purest azure dyes But Jove and Venus green about the hght, To frame thought best, as bringing most delight, That to pin'd hearts hope might for aye arise. Nature, all said, a paradise of green There plac'd, to make all love which have them seen.' Note on translation of Juvenal, Sat. ziiL Mg."

It might be read: 'And I am nothing slow to back his haste'—that is, I am diligent to abet and enforce his haste. [Hal. Mal. If this kind of phraseology be justifiable, it can be so only by supposing the meaning to be, there is nothing of slowness in me, to induce me to slacken or abate his haste. The meaning of Paris is very clear. He does not wish to restrain Capulet or to delay his own marriage. But the words which the poet has given him import the reverse of this, and seem rather to mean, I am not backward in restraining his haste; I endeavor to retard him as much as I can. [Sing. Huds. Dyce (ed. 2).] Dr. Johnson saw the impropriety of this expression, and that his interpretation extorted a meaning from the words which they do not at first present; and hence his proposed alteration; but Sh. must answer for his own peculiarities. See Ant. and Cleop., IV, xii. [Hal. Sing. Sh. has hastily fallen into similar inadvertencies elsewhere. Knt. The meaning is obvious as it stands: ‘I am nothing slow (so as), to slack his haste.' Sta. Sh.’s marvellous power of condensation sometimes renders his meaning obscure. In this instance, the sense appears to be, ‘and I am not slow in my own preparations for the wedding, to give him any reason to slacken his hasty proceedings.’ [Dyce (ed. 2). Coll. (ed. 2). We should rather say, ‘I am something slow,’ &c.; and what Paris means, obviously, is, I have no wish that he should lessen his haste. The (Q1) makes the speech the very reverse. Ktly. Collier’s (MS.) mistakes the sense. ‘To’ is so as to, that I should. Editors have not understood it. Clarke. There are remarkably few instances of elliptical diction in the present play. It is a form that Sh. used but sparingly in his earlier dramas, whereas, in his latter ones, it occurs perpetually. As his habit of writing and facility of expression increased, so his power of condensed and inclusive phraseology strengthened; while his own taste and judgment made him ever more and more exercise it as a skill in itself and productive of the most vigorous effect."

Since this interpretation gives throughout a clear meaning—for that Paris does not positively know how Juliet is minded does not preclude the conviction on his part that the expression of her love is alone wanting,—since it renders more graceful the connection with what follows, in so far as Julia, silent about love, is his sorrowing Venus, and since I have talk could have been more easily corrupted into I have talk'd than the reverse, we abide by the old reading."

The Italian custom here alluded to, of carrying the dead body to the grave richly dressed and with the face uncovered (which is not mentioned by Painter), Sh. found particularly described in Romeus and Juliet: ‘An other use there is, that whosoever dyes, Borne to their church, with open face upon the heere he lyes, In wonted weed attyrde, not wrapt in winding sheete.’ [Sing. Huds. Sta. Hal. Steev. Thus in Ophelia’s Song in Hamlet, IV, v, 64. Hal. Knt. In the adaptation of Bandello’s tale in Painter’s ‘Palace of Pleasure’ we have, ‘they will judge you to be dead, and, according to the custom of our city, you shall be carried to the church-yard hard by our chuich.’ Painter has no description of this custom; but Sh. saw how beautifully it accorded with the conduct of his story, and he therefore emphatically repeats it in the directions of the Friar after Juliet’s supposed death; IV, v, 79. Ancient customs survive when they are built upon the unaltering parts of national character, and have connection with unalterable local circumstances. Juliet was carried to her tomb as the maids and matrons of Italy are still carried: ‘— And, lying on her funeral couch, Like one asleep, her eyelids closed, her hands Folded together on her modest breast As ’twere her nightly posture, through the crowd She came at last—and richly, gaily clad, As for a birthday feast’—Rogers, Italy.

        "Knt.: on the bier] Knt. The editors [in omitting the line from QqFf] have here gone far beyond their office; nor can we understand why the more particular working out of the idea in the next two lines should have given them offence. ‘Be borne’ means to be borne. Dyce (Remarks, &c., p. 174). The line [of the QqFf] is a various lection of the two lines [in, 112]. I apprehend that Knight would search the poetry of England in vain for another example of such an ellipsis as ‘Be borne’ for to be borne. When Beaumont and Fletcher imitated the passage in The Knight of Malta, IV, i, they were content with one reading. Lettsom [marginal MS. note on the above in the present editor’s copy]. Very true. These various lections, like those in Love’s Lab. L., seem to have originated in transcribing from Sh.’s foul copies. Ulr. The hypothesis that the line ‘Be borne,’ &c., retained its place in the MS. only through an oversight of Sh. when he revised the piece (about 1598), supposes that the printer of Q2 had before him Sh.’s own handwriting, which is very improbable. At all events, it is unscholarly upon such an hypothesis to omit the line altogether. For although it is not to be denied that it seems superfluous, yet it may be quite easily conformed to the construction, if Knight’s explanation of the ellipsis be correct. Cambr. We have [here] omitted a line which occurs in all the Quartos, except the first, and all the Folios, because it could not be retained without absolute detriment to the sense."

Dyce, Hal., Mal.] This arose from his sometimes following and sometimes deserting his original. The scene referred to was his own invention; but here he recollected the poem; ‘he myndes to make for him a costly feast.'",
        "Knt. According to an entry in the books of the Stationers’ Company for 1560, the preacher was paid six shillings and twopence for his labour; the minstrel, twelve shillings; and the cook, fifteen shillings. The relative scale of estimation for theology, poetry, and gastronomy, has not been much altered during two centuries, either in the city generally, or in the Company which represents the city’s literature.",
        "Ben Jonson quoted by Knt.: A master cook I why, he’s a man of men For a professor; he designs, he draws, He paints, he carves, he builds, he fortifies. Makes citadels of curious fowl and fish. Some he dry-ditches, some motes round with broth, Mounts marrow-bones, cuts fifty angled custards, Rears bulwark pies; and, for his outer works, He raiseth ramparts of immortal crust, And teacheth all the tactics at one dinner What ranks, what files, to put his dishes in. The whole art military! Then he knows The influence of the stars upon his meats, And all their seasons, tempers, qualities, And so to fit his relishes and sauces. He has nature in a pot, 'bove all the chemists, Or bare-breech’d brethren of the rosy cross. He is an architect, an engineer, A soldier, a physician, a philosopher, A general mathematician.",
        "Knt.: Capulet is evidently a man of ostentation; but his ostentation, as is most generally the case, is covered with a thin veil of affected indifference. In Act I he says to his guests: ‘We have a trifling, foolish banquet toward.’ In Act III, when he settles the day of Paris’s marriage, he just hints: ‘We’ll keep no great ado—a friend or two.’ But Sh. knew that these indications of the ‘pride which apes humility’ were not inconsistent with the ‘twenty cooks’—the regret that ‘We shall be much unfurnished for this time,’ and the solicitude expressed in ‘Look to the baked meats, good Angelica.’",
        "Steevens: Steevens turns up his nose aristocratically at Sh. for imputing ‘to an Italian nobleman and his lady all the petty solicitudes of a private house, concerning a provincial entertainment;’ and he adds, very grandly: ‘To such a bustle our author might have been witness at home; but the like anxieties could not well have occurred in the family of Capulet.’ Steevens had not well read the history of society, either in Italy or in England, to have fallen into the error of believing that the great were exempt from such ‘anxieties.’ The baron’s lady overlooked the baron’s kitchen from her private chamber; and the still-room and the spicery not unfrequently occupied a large portion of her attention.

        "Malone: near night] In III, v, Romeo parted from his bride at daybreak on Tuesday morning. Immediately afterwards she went to Friar Laurence, and he particularly mentions (IV, i, 90) that the next day is Wednesday. She could not well have remained more than an hour or two with the Friar, and she is just now returned from shrift; yet Lady Capulet says, ‘'Tis near night,’ and this same night is ascertained to be Tuesday. This is one of the many instances of Sh.’s inaccuracy in the computation of time.",
        "Ulr.: Malone is perfectly right, and would never have made such a mistake;—but Sh., marry, was no Malone.",
        "Clarke.: If the indications of time be examined in the present play, we shall see how ingeniously Sh. has taken pains to trace it all along. In Scene i, the Prince desires Capulet to go with him at once, and Montague to come to him ‘this afternoon.’ In Scene ii, Capulet speaks of Montague being ‘bound’ as well as himself, which indicates that the Prince’s charge had just been given to both of them, and shortly after speaks of the festival at his house ‘this night.’ At this festival Romeo sees Juliet when she speaks of sending to him ‘tomorrow;’ and on that ‘morrow’ the lovers are united by Friar Laurence. Act III opens with the scene where Tybalt kills Mercutio, and during which scene Romeo’s words, ‘Tybalt, that an hour hath been my kinsman,’ show that the then time is the afternoon of the same day. The Friar, at the close of Scene iii of that Act bids Romeo ‘good night;’ and in the next scene, Paris, in reply to Capulet’s inquiry, ‘What day is this?’ replies, ‘Monday, my lord.’ This, by the way, denotes that the ‘old accustomed feast’ of the Capulets, according to a usual practice in Catholic countries, was celebrated on a Sunday evening. In Scene v of Act III comes the parting of the lovers at the dawn of Tuesday, and when, at the close of the scene, Juliet says she shall repair to Friar Laurence’ cell. Act IV commences with her appearance there, thus carrying on the action during the same day, Tuesday. But the effect of long time is introduced by the mention of ‘evening mass,’ and by the Friar’s detailed directions and reference to ‘tomorrow’s night;’ so that when the mind has been prepared by the change of scene, by Capulet’s anxious preparations for the wedding, and by Juliet’s return to filial submission, there seems no violence done to the imagination by Lady Capulet’s remarking, ‘'Tis now near night.’ Nay, it is one of Sh.’s expedients in dramatic art for bringing on the period of the catastrophe; for Juliet retires to her own room with the intention of selecting wedding attire for the next morning, which her father has said shall be that of the marriage, anticipating it by a whole day—Wednesday instead of Thursday—thus naturally preparing for the immediate sequence of the incidents in the remainder of Act IV."

If it be assumed that Juliet, or rather Sh., wishes to thrust aside utterly the suspicion which comes up in her mind, then this line is absolutely necessary. But it may fairly be asked whether this were the intention of the poet. It was emphatically so according to the text of (Q1). On the other hand, the enlarging and revising which the whole monologue received in the 'corrected, augmented, and amended' edition of consists precisely herein that Sh. brings forward far more strongly and impressively than in (Q1) the doubts, the apprehensions, and horror which seize Juliet’s soul at the sight of the vial which she must drain, and this is done manifestly to place in clearer light the loftiness of her resolve and the depth of her love and fidelity. With this in view it would clearly be very little to the purpose to represent the suspicion aroused against Laurence as wholly allayed.

An inferior degree of animal life was attributed to it, and it was commonly supposed that when torn from the ground it uttered groans of so pernicious a nature that the person who committed the violence went mad or died.

See Bulleine’s Bulwarke of Defence against Sieknesse, p. 41. These strange notions arose, probably, from the little less fanciful comparison of the root to the human figure, strengthened, doubtless, in England by the accidental circumstance of man being the first syllable of the word. The ancients, however, made the same comparison of its form: \"Quamvis semihominis, vesano gramine fœta, Mandragoræ pariat flores.\"—Columella, de R. Rust., xi. The white mandrake, which they called the male, was that whose root bore this resemblance. Lyte says of it, \"The roote is great and white, not muche unlyke a radishe roote divided into two or three partes and sometimes growing one upon another, almost lyke the legges and thighes of a man.\" Transl. of Dodoens, p. 437. It is supposed to cause death, in 2 Hen. VI: III, ii, 310. A very diminutive or grotesque figure was often compared to a mandrake; that is, to the root as above described. So in 2 Hen. IV: I, ii, 17. It was sometimes considered as an emblem of incontinence; probably because it resembled only the lower parts of a man; as in 2 Hen. IV: III, ii, 338. [Dyce, Sta.] \"Therefore they did tye some dogge or other lyving beast unto the roote thereof wyth a corde, and digged the earth in compasse round about, and in the meane tyme stopped their own eares for feare of the terreble shriek and cry of this Mandrack. In whych cry it doth not only dye itselfe, but the feare thereof kylleth the dogge or beast which pulleth it out of the earth.\"—Bulleine’s Bulwark of Defence against Sicknesse, 1575. Halliwell. \"Whereas the Latino texte hath here somnia speculantes Mandragore, I have translated it in Englishe, our minds all occupied with mad fantastical dreames, because Mandragora is an herbe, as phisycions saye, that causeth folks to slepe, and therein to have many mad fantastical dreames.\"—Sir T. More's Workes, 1557."

The line in Q1 Ff is partly composed of a stage-direction, 'here drink' having evidently crept into the text and become \"here’s drink.\" [Del., Sing. (ed. 2), Huds., White, Cambr., Knt. (ed. 2), Coleridge (Lit. Rem. vol. ii, p. 157). Sh. provides for the finest decencies. It would have been too bold a thing for a girl of fifteen; but she swallows the draught in a fit of fright. [Huds. Hudson. Schlegel has the same thought: \"Her imagination falls into an uproar,—so many terrors bewilder the tender brain of the maiden,—and she drinks off the cup in a tumult, to drain which with composure would have evinced a too masculine resolvedness.\" Knt. (Stratford ed.). We do not adopt the reading of (Q1), because \"come\" would seem to imply that Romeo was dead and Juliet was about to meet him in another world. [Dyce (ed. 1).] Dyce (ed. 1): I neither admire Knight’s reficted line, nor acknowledge the force of his objection to \"I come.\" Stage-direction] Coll. The “curtains” were “the traverse,” as it was called, at the back of the stage. Dyck (Life of Sh. p. 42, ed. 2). At the third sounding, or flourish of trumpets, the exhibition began. The curtain, which concealed the stage from the audience, was then drawn, opening in the middle and running upon iron rods. Other curtains, called traverses, were used as a substitute for scenes. At the back of the stage was a balcony, the platform of which was raised about eight or nine feet from the ground; it served as a window, gallery, or upper chamber; from it a portion of the dialogue was sometimes spoken, and in front of it curtains were suspended to conceal, if necessary, those who occupied it from the audience. The internal roof of the stage, either painted blue or adorned with drapery of that colour, was termed the heavens. The stage was generally strewed with rushes, but on extraordinary occasions was matted. We have reason to believe that when tragedies were performed it was hung with black. Movable painted scenery there was none; \"The air-blest castle, round whose wholesome crest The martlet, guest of summer, chose her nest,— The forest walks of Arden’s fair domain, Where Jacques fed his solitary vein; No pencil’s aid as yet had dar’d supply, Seen only by the intellectual eye.\"—Charles Lamb. A board, containing the name of the place of action in large letters, was displayed in some conspicuous situation. At times, when a change of scene was necessary, the audience was required to suppose that the performers, who had not quitted the stage, had passed to a different spot. A bed thrust forth showed that the stage was a bed-chamber; and a table with pen and ink indicated that it was a counting-house. Rude contrivances were employed to imitate towers, walls of towns, hell-mouths, tombs, trees, dragons, &c.; trap-doors had been early in use; but to make a celestial personage ascend to the roof of the stage was more than the mechanists of those days could always accomplish. [Foot Note. A stage-direction at the end of Greene’s Alphonstis is, \"Exit Venus; or, if you can conveniently, let a chair come down from the top of the stage and draw her up.\" See Greene’s Dramatic and Poetical Works, p. 248, ed.

The original time for ringing it was eight in the evening; and we are told by some writers that in many villages the name is still retained for the evening bell. Brand, in his observations on Bourne’s Antiquities, says: \"We retain also a vestige of the old Norman curfeiv at eight in the evening\" (chap. i). In The Merry Devil of Edmonton it is represented as having got an hour later: \"Well, ’tis nine o’clock, ’tis time o ring the curfew.\"—O. PI, V..292. By [this] passage in Romeo and Juliet it seems that the bell which was commonly used for that purpose obtained in time the name of the curfeu-bell, and was so called whenever it rung on any occasion. At the regular time it probably was called simply the curfew; at others, if it was known that the same bell was used, it might be said, as above, that the curfew-bell had rung. Ritson. The curfew-bell is universally rung at eight or nine o’clock at night; generally according to the season. The term is here used with peculiar impropriety, as it is not believed that any bell was ever rung so early as three in the morning. The derivation of curfeu is well known; but it is a mere vulgar error that the institution was a badge of slavery imposed by the Norman Conqueror. To put out the fire became necessary only because it was time to go to bed. And if the curfew commanded all fires to be exanguished, the morning bell ordered them to be lighted again. In short, the ringing of these two bells was a manifest and essential service to people who had scarcely any other means of measuring their time. [Cham.] Mitford (Gent. Mag., 1845, p. 579): not mean that the bell rang for curfew, but that the same bell which was used for the curfew was now rung as the morning bell. Del. In all other passages Sh. uses curfew in its own proper significatior. And yet (Q1) has: The curfew-bell hath rung, ’tis four o’clock. Ulr. It is very unlikely that it should be rung as early as three o’clock in the morning; and old Capulet in his furrying officiousness only imagines that he has heard it. White. An error inexplicable to me. The curfew-bell was rung at eight in the evening. It is still rung at nine in New England, though within the last ten years the custom has been rapidly disappearing. Sh. elsewhere (Meas. for Meas., IV, ii, 78, and Lear III, iv, 21) uses ‘curfew’ correctly. Clarke. Inasmuch as the same bell was used for ringing the last thing at night and the first thing in the morning, it is probable that what is here familiarly called \"the curfew-bell,\" means, more strictly speaking, \"the matin-bell.\""

        "Dyce (ed. 2).: Walker (“Crit.” &c., vol. ii, p. 184) would assign this speech to Lady Capulet (as Singer does); but that alteration is forbidden, at least by (Q1), where the next speech stands thus: \"Cap, I warrant thee Nurse I haue ere now watcht all night, and haue taken no harme at all.\" Theobald’s reading is probably what Sh. wrote.",
        "Ktly.: Singer was most certainly right in giving this speech to Lady Capulet; for the Nurse was hardly present.",
        "Hunter (\"Few Words in Reply,\" &c., 1853, p. 19): Finding \"cutquean\" in Golding’s Ovid used in a sense which could be applied only to a female, it appeared to me that this free expression must be addressed to Lady Capulet, and not to her husband. My idea was that there ought to have been a break at \"go;\" that, having thus in her unceremonious manner dismissed the Lady, she then turned herself to Capulet himself. Dyce is quite right in saying that the context sufficiently disproves the notion that the Nurse was speaking to the Lady, if we take the passage without the break. Dyce further says that Golding writes, \"cucquean.\" Not always—for in my copy of Golding, 4to, 1593, printed by John Danler, Sign. 1 , iv, we have: \"But she considering that Queen I’rogne was a cutquean made by means of her.\" He does, however, write \"cucquean\" in another place. On the whole, I now agree with Dyce, and others, in thinking that the \"cotquean\" of the Nurse does mean \"a man that busies himself in women’s affairs,\" and that the whole of what the Nurse says is addressed to Capulet. The jealous-hood, which might appear naturally enough to arise out of the use of such a word as that which the Nurse used, seems to have an origin later in the dialogue.",
        "Sing. (ed. 2): That a cot-quecn signified a man who troubled himself with female affairs, what has since been called a molly-coddle, as well as a hen-pecked husband, is quite certain.

Besides, what business has the Nurse to reply to a speech addressed to her mistress? Lady Capulet afterwards calls her husband a mouse-hunt; another appellation which, like cot-quean, none but a wife would dare to use. [Verp, Huds. Sing. (ed. 1)]. This speech should surely be given to Lady Capulet. The Nurse had been sent for spices, and is shortly after made to re-enter.",

It continued long in use in this sense, and is quoted by Addison, who compares a woman meddling with state affairs to a man interfering in female business, a cot-quean, adding, \"Each of the sexes should keep within its bounds.\" It seems to have meant, also, a hen-pecked husband, which suits the same derivation. [Verp. Huds.] In the following passage it means masculine hussy. It is spoken by Ovid, as Jupiter, to Julia, as Juno: \"We tell thee thou angerest us, cot-quean; and we will thunder thee in pieces for thy cotqueanity.\"—B. Jons., Poetaster, IV, iii. [Huds.]",

The Nurse is speaking to Lady Capulet, and the word calls forth all the conversation which follows about jealousy. Authorities for this being the true sense might be produced in abundance.",
        "Dyce (\"Few Notes,\" p. 113): But Golding, in the passage to which Hunter refers, has cuc-queane, which is a distinct word from cot-quean, though they are sometimes confounded by early writers,—a cuc-quean (cuck quean, or cock quean) meaning a she-cuckold; a cot-quean, a man who busies himself too much in women’s affairs. [Substantially, Sing, (ed. 2), Coll. (ed. 2).] In Fletcher’s Love's Cure, Act II, Sc. ii, Hebadilla says to Lucio (who has been brought up as a girl): \"Diablo! what should you do in the kitchen? Cannot the cooks lick their fingers, without your overseeing? nor the maids make pottage, except your dog’s head be in the pot? Don Lucio? Don Quot-quean, Don Spinster! wear a petticoat stil', and put on your smock a’ Monday; I will have a baby o’ clouts made for it, like a great girl,\"—where \"Quot-quean\" is a corrupt form of \"Cot-quean.\" Even in Addison’s days the word cot-quean was still used to signify one who is too busy in meddling with women’s affairs. See the letter of an imaginary lady in The Spectator, No. 482. Hunter’s notion that the Nurse is speaking to Lady Capulet is, I think sufficiently disproved by the context.",
        "White.: As late as the beginning of the last century, a man given to prying into women’s matters was called a cot-quean. See Vanbrugh's Confederacy (1705), Act II: \"Money-trap, You won’t take it amiss if I should ask you a few questions?—Flippanta, What’s this Cot-quean going to pry into now?\" And in the Craven dialect a man fond of cooking for himself is called a cot."

Decker, in Old Fortunatus, 1600: ‘set your heart at rest, for I have set up my rest, that unless you can run swifter than a hart,’ &c. Also in B. and Fl.’s Elder Brother: ‘My rest is up. Nor will I go less.’ Again in the Roaring Girl, 1611: ‘Like a musket on a rest.’ See Montfaucon’s Monarchie Françoise, tom. v, pl. [Halliwell, Reed.] It is, however, oftener employed with reference to the game at primero, in which it was one of the terms then in use. In the second instance above quoted it is certainly so. See Dodsley’s Collection of Old Plays, vol. x, p. 364, edit. 1780, where several instances are brought together. [Ibid.] M. Mason: It means that the gamester has determined what stake he would play for. In the passage from Fletcher’s Elder Brother, where Eustace says, ‘My rest is up, and I will go no less,’ he means to say, my stake is laid, and I will not play for a smaller. The same phrase very frequently occurs in the plays of B. and Fl. It is also used by Lord Clarendon in his History, as well as in the old comedy of Supposes, 1587. [Ibid.] Boswell: Nash quibbles upon this word in his Terrors of the Night: ‘You that are married and have wives of your owne, and yet hold too nere frendship with your neighbours, set up your rests, that the Night will be an il neighbour to your rest, and that you shall have as little peace of mind as the rest.’ [Sing. Halliwell.] Nares: A metaphor from the game of primero, meaning, to stand upon the cards you have in your hand in hopes that they may prove better than your adversary. Hence to make up your mind, to be determined. It is fully explained in an epigram of Sir J. Harington’s, where Marcus, a foolish gamester, is described as standing at first upon small games and consequently losing; but still losing, by the fraud of his antagonists, even when he grew more wary. Hence we may see how erroneous was one of Steevens’ explanations of this phrase. I say one, for he has given the right in other places. A rest was, in fact, an appendage to every matchlock gun, not particularly the harquebuss, because the soldier could not manage his match without it. There was, therefore, such a rest, but that was not the allusion. [Staunton, substantially. Sing. (ed. l) [Note on All’s Well, II, i, 138].] This word furnished many other proverbial expressions among the Italians, one of which is to be found in the CirifFo Calvanco of Luca Pulci: ‘del suo resto,' to adventure all. 'Haver fatto del resto' to have lost all or have nothing to rest upon. 'Riserbar il Resto' to reserve one’s rest, to be wary and circumspect, &c., &c. All authorities are decisive upon the derivation of this word from Primero, as Nares has amply shown. ... In Spanish too, 'Echar el resto' to set or lay up one's rest, has the same origin and figurative meaning—to adventure all, to be determined. We shall now, it is to be hoped, hear no more of musket rests, &c., in explanation of this phrase. Collier (ed. i): A figurative expression apparently derived from the mode of firing the heavy harquebuss by placing the barrel upon a rest or support. The phrase was applied in a variety of ways, generally indicating determination; as at the game of Primero, a person who had staked all the money he meant to risk at once was said to have ‘set up his rest.’ It was in constant use. Hudson: The same as to make up one’s mind. Launcelot (Mer. of Ven. II, ii, 110) has a similar quibble. See also Com. of Errors, IV, iii, Collier (ed. 2) [Note on All’s Well, II, i, 138]: This expression is not derived from Primero or any other game of cards, but originally from musketry. ... Dyce, in his Beaumont and Fletcher, always refers it to some game and not to its true origin. We say this in spite of Gifford. Ben Jonson, vol. i, p. 107. Dyce (ed. 2): This phrase, meaning that the speaker is perfectly determined on a thing, is “a metaphor taken from play, where the highest stake the parties were disposed to venture was called the rest. To appropriate this term to any particular game, as is sometimes done, is extremely incorrect.”—Gifford’s note on Massinger’s Works, vol. ii, p. 21, ed."

Malone applauds Steevens for his emendation. Barron Field fully concurs in this return to the authentic text. [Verp. substantially.] Staunton: Most of the modern editors follow Capell, whose change is uncalled for; ‘living’ here implies possessions—fortunes, not existence. We meet with the same distinction between life and living in the ‘ Merc, of Ven.,’ V, i, 286, where Antonio, whose life had been saved by Portia, says: “Sweet lady, you have given me life and living.”"

        "‘My heart is full of woe :’] Steevens: This is the burthen of the first stanza of A Pleasant new Ballad of Two Lovers: “Hey hoe! my heart is full of woe.” [Sing. Hudson, Dyce, Staunton. It is in the Pepys collection, and begins thus: “Complaine, my lute, complaine on him, That stayes so long away; He promised to be here ere this, But still unkind doth stay; But now the proverbe true I finde, Once out of sight, then out of mind. Hey ho! my heart is full of woe.” Clarke, Dyce (ed. 2). The ballad just cited is of considerable merit, and the whole of it may be found in The Sh. Soc. Papers, vol. i, p. 12.]",
        "dump] Steevens: A dump anciently signified some kind of dance as well as sorrow. So in Humour Out of Breath, by John Day, 1607: “He loves nothing but an Italian dump, or a French brawl.” But here means a mournful song. In The Arraignment of Paris, 1584, after the shepherds have sung an elegiac hymn over the hearse of Colin, Venus says to Paris: ‘How cheers my lovely boy after this dump of woe? Paris. Such dumps, sweet lady, as bin these, are deadly dumps to prove.’ [Staunton, Halliwell.] Ritson: Dumps were heavy mournful tunes; possibly, indeed, any sort of movements were once so called. Hence doleful dumps, deep sorrow, or grievous affliction as in the less ancient ballad of Chevy Chase. It is still said of a person uncommonly sad, that he is in the dumps. In a MS. of Hen. VIII’s time is a tune for the cittern or guitar, entitled, “My lady Careys dompe;” there is also “The duke of Sommersettes dompe,” as we now say, ‘Lady Coventry’s minuet,’ &c. “If thou wert not some blockish and senseless dolt, thou wouldest never laugh when I sung a heavy mixt-Lydian tune, or a note to a dumpe or dolefull dittie.” Plutarch’s Morals, by Holland, 1602, p. 61. [Ibid. Reed.] Douce: In some of the notes on this word it has been supposed to be connected with the card game of gleek; but it was not recollected that the Saxon language supplied the term dig, ludibrium, and doubtless a corresponding verb. Thus glee signifies mirth, jocularity; and gleeman, or gligman, a minstrel or joculator. Gleek was, therefore, used to express a stronger sort of joke, a scoffing. It does not appear that the phrase to give the gleek was ever introduced in the above game, which was borrowed by us from the French, and derived from an original of very different import from the word in question. To give the minstrel is no more than a punning phrase for giving the gleek. Minstrels and jesters were anciently called gleekmen or gligmen. [Dyce, Singer, Hudson, Halliwell.] Nares: Formerly the received term for a melancholy strain in music. A merry dump in this passage is evidently a purposed absurdity suited to the character of the speaker. Stafford Smith gave to Steevens the music (without words) of a dump which he had discovered in an old MS. A dump appears also to have been a kind of dance. Dumps, for sorrow, was not always a burlesque expression. It was even used in the sense of elegy. Davies, of Hereford, has a singular poem in that style, entitled ‘A Dump upon the Death of the most noble Henrie Earle of Pembrooke.’ [Singer, Knight (ed. 2) (substantially), Dyce.] Knight: That it was a sad or dismal strain, perhaps sometimes for the sake of contrast and effect mixed up with livelier airs, appears from Cavendish’s Metrical Visions, p. 17: “What is now left to helpe me in this case? Nothing at all but dompe in the dance, Among deade men to tryppe on the trace.” Collier (ed. i): See Chappell’s ‘National English Airs,’ vol. ii, p. 137. [Verp.] Staunton: Master Peter’s ‘merry dump’ was a purposed contradiction in terms. Dyce: Chappell remarks: ‘A dump was a slow dance. Queen Mary’s Dump is one of the tunes in William Ballet’s Lute Book, and My Lady Carey’s Dompe is printed in Stafford Smith’s Musica Antiqua, ii, 470, from a MS. in the British Museum, temp. Henry VIII.’ White: ‘Dump’ conveyed no ludicrous impression in Sh.’s day, though here it serves a comic purpose."

        "gleek] Steevens: To gleek is to scoff, taken from an ancient game at cards called gleek. So in Turberville’s translation of Ovid’s Epistle from Dido to Æneas: “By manly mart to purchase prayse, And give his foes the gleeke.” Again, in the argument to the same translator’s version of Hermione to Orestes: “Orestes gave Achylles’ sonne the gleekee.” [Halliwell.] Ritson: The use of this cant term is nowhere explained, and, in all probability, cannot, at this distance of time, be recovered. To gleek, however, signified to put a joke or trick upon a person, perhaps to jest according to the coarse humour of that age. [Halliwell.] Douce: In some of the notes on this word it has been supposed to be connected with the card game of gleek; but it was not recollected that the Saxon language supplied the term dig, ludibrium, and doubtless a corresponding verb. Thus glee signifies mirth, jocularity; and gleeman, or gligman, a minstrel or joculator. Gleek was, therefore, used to express a stronger sort of joke, a scoffing. It does not appear that the phrase to give the gleek was ever introduced in the above game, which was borrowed by us from the French, and derived from an original of very different import from the word in question. To give the minstrel is no more than a punning phrase for giving the gleek. Minstrels and jesters were anciently called gleekmen or gligmen. [Dyce, Singer, Hudson, Halliwell.] Nares: To give the gleek meant to pass a jest upon, to make a person ridiculous. To give the minstrel, which follows, has no such meaning. Peter only means, “I will call you minstrel and so treat you,” to which the musician replies, “Then I will give you the serving creature,” as a personal retort in kind. Dyce, Staunton: To give the gleek, a phrase borrowed from the old game of cards called gleek, signified to flout or scorn any one, and, as a gleekman or gligman was a name for a minstrel, we get a notion of the quibble meant. A similar equivoque is, no doubt, intended in “the serving creature,” but the allusion is yet to be discovered. White: The allusion to the glee-man or gligmon is obvious. Not so, however, the double meaning in the musician’s reply, unless Peter means that he will apply the term ‘minstrel’ reproachfully, and the musician that he will retort by calling Peter the servant to the minstrel."

        " Keightley (N. and Q., 2d Ser. vol. xii, p. 65, 1861): I have more than once remarked the slender acquaintance with the language and literature of Spain shown by our Shakespearian critics, and the present is an instance, and a strong one, of the truth of my observation. Set up rest, they all tell us, belonged to the game of Primero, which was derived from Spain. Now the dictionary of the Spanish Academy defines Resto in these words (the reader must excuse my quoting Spanish): “En los juegos de envite es aquella cantidad que separa el jugador del demas dinero para jugar y envidar”; and Echar el resto (set up the rest), “En el juego donde hai envites envidar con todo el caudal que uno tiene delante y de que hace su resto.” Envidar and envite, I may here observe, come from the Latin verb invito, and signify challenge, wager, bet—a sense in which the Italians also use their verb invitare, and which is also to be found in the French il Venvi and our own vie. Rest, then, is a Spanish term which was adopted along with the Spanish name of the game Primero (properly Brimera), or Quinola, a term also in use; just as when the Spanish game of Ombre came into England it brought in its train Basto, Spadilla, Manilla (Malilla), Matador. Another term which came with Primero was flush, the Spanish flux, the sibilant, as usual, taking the place of the guttural. It is plain that the rest was different from the stake, and was what we term a bet. It may be finally observed that set up was equivalent to lay down, and arose from the piling up of the money ventured, and that we still use set and lay with an ellipse in each case of the preposition. Set up rest soon came to be used in a general sense, as meaning make up one’s mind, resolve on—a sense in which it occurs more than once in Sh. The same seems to have been the case in Spanish. Keightley (N. and Q., 2d Ser. vol. xii, p. 451, 1861): It has struck me as being rather strange that our forefathers, when they got the game of Primero from Spain, did not render echar el resto literally, ‘Put or lay down the rest.’ I believe the reason was that they had the phrase set up rest already, but in its military sense, and so they frugally made it do double duty. Steevens was not altogether wrong in his derivation of this phrase."

        "Coll. Notes and Emendl): flattering truth,* since ‘truth’ cannot flatter; and Malone, not liking Johnson’s interpretation, preferred, what is to the full as unintelligible, the text of (Q1). The real truth (not the ‘flattering truth’) seems to be that the old compositor was confounded between ‘trust’ in the first part of the line, and death near the end of it, and printed a word which he compounded of the beginning of the one word and of the end of the other.",
        "Dyce: Vindicated^). A more unhappy and absurd conjecture than this is scarcely to be paralleled, even by some of the other doings of the (MS.). I read ‘flattering soother sleep.’ The similarity of sound, in recitation, of the words truth of and soother may have led to the error; and the poetical beauty of the passage is much heightened by the personification of sleep.",
        "Dyce ('Few Notes'): The meaning is, in vulgar prose, If I may trust the visions with which my eye flattered me during sleep. I have not forgotten how our early writers characterize Sleep,—for instance, I recollect that Sleep is called by Sackville ‘cousin of Death’ and ‘a living death,’ and by Daniel, ‘brother to Death;’ but I remember nothing in the whole range of poetry which bears any resemblance to such a combination of words as ‘the flattering death of sleep’ of Collier’s (MS.); and, though I may lay myself open to the charge of presumption, I unhesitatingly assert, not only that the expression never could have come from Sh.’s pen, but that it is akin to nonsense.",
        "Hal.: That is. If I may trust that as true which sleep has revealed to me of a flattering nature.",
        "Ulr.: Romeo means to say, If I dare trust the truth which one is wont to impute to dreams, but which is only the truth of a flattery, therefore unsafe, untrustworthy, then my dreams presage, &c. I can find no meaning in the emendation of Collier’s (MS.).",
        "Sing. (ed. 2): Sleep the poet elsewhere calls balm of hurt minds, and ‘Nature’s soft nurse.’",
        "Sta.: The ‘truth of sleep’ is even less intelligible than the ‘eye of sleep.’ By the latter Sh. perhaps meant vision, view, prospect. Thus in King John, II, i, 207 : ‘These flags of France, that are advanced here Before the eye and prospect of your town.’ And in ‘Much Ado,’ IV, i, 228 ; * And every lovely organ of her life...Into the eye and prospect of his soul.’",
        "Coll. (ed. 2): This seems one of the happiest of the minor emendations of the (MS.). Nothing can well be more intelligible and pertinent than ‘death’ instead of truth. It was the ‘flattering death of sleep,’ because Romeo had had such ‘flattering’ dreams during ‘sleep,’ which state has been, over and over again, likened by poets to ‘death.’ The ‘flattering eye of sleep’ nobody can satisfactorily explain.",
        "Dyce, 'Strictures,' p. 167, 1859: Mr. Collier may be assured that this new reading will seem to everybody else (Professor Mommsen perhaps excepted) one of the rashest and most unfortunate of the changes recorded in that omnium gatherum of conjecture."

        "Knight: an apothecary] The criticism of the French school has not spared this famous passage. Joseph Warton, an elegant scholar, but who belonged to this school, has the following observations in his Virgil (1763, vol. i, page 301): ‘It may not be improper to produce the following glaring instance of the absurdity of introducing long and minute descriptions into tragedy. When Romeo receives the dreadful and unexpected news of Juliet’s death, this fond husband, in an agony of grief, immediately resolves to poison himself. But his sorrow is interrupted while he gives us an exact picture of the apothecary-shop, where he intends to purchase the poison. I appeal to those who know anything of the human heart, whether Romeo in this distressful situation, could have leisure to think of the alligator, empty boxes, and bladders, and other furniture of this beggarly shop, and to point them out so distinctly to the audience. The description is, indeed, very lively and natural, but very improperly put into the mouth of a person agitated with such passion as Romeo is represented to be.’ The criticism of Warton, ingenious as it may appear, and true as applied to many ‘long and minute descriptions in tragedy,’ is here based upon a wrong principle. He says that Romeo, in his distressful situation, had not ‘leisure’ to think of the furniture of the apothecary’s shop. What then had he leisure to do? Had he leisure to run off into declamations against fate and into tedious apostrophes and generalizations, as a less skilful artist than Sh. would have made him indulge in? From the moment he had said, 'Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night, Let’s see for means,’ the apothecary’s shop became to him the object of the most intense interest. Great passions, when they have shaped themselves into firm resolves, attach the most distinct importance to the minutest objects connected with the execution of their purpose. He had seen the apothecary’s shop in his placid moments as an object of curiosity. He had hastily looked at the tortoise and the alligator, the empty boxes and the earthen pots; and he had looked at the tattered weed and overwhelming brows of their needy owner. But he had also said, when he first saw these things: ‘An if a man did need a poison now, Whose sale is present death in Mantua, Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.’ When he did need a poison, all these documents of the misery that was to serve him, came with a double intensity upon his vision. The shaping of these things into words was not for the audience. It was not to introduce a ‘long and minute description into tragedy’ that had no foundation in the workings of nature. It was the very cunning of nature which produced this description. Mischief was, indeed, swift to enter into the thoughts of the desperate man. But the mind once made up, it took a perverse pleasure in going over every circumstance that had suggested the means of mischief. All other thoughts had passed out of Romeo’s mind. He had nothing left but to die; and everything connected with the means of his death was seized upon by his imagination with an energy that could only find relief in words. Sh. has exhibited the same knowledge of nature in his sad and solemn poem of ‘The Rape of Lucrece,’ where the injured wife, having resolved to wipe out her stain by death, ‘ —— calls to mind where hangs a piece Of skilfuil painting, made for Priam’s Troy.’—1366, 7. She sees in that painting some fancied resemblance to her own position, and spends the heavy hours till her husband arrives in its contemplation [1496-8]. It was the intense interest in his own resolve which made Romeo so minutely describe his apothecary. But that stage past, came the abstraction of his sorrow; ‘What said my man, when my betossed soul Did not attend him, as we rode? I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet.’ Juliet was dead, and what mattered it to his ‘betossed soul’ who she should have married? ‘Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night’ was the sole thought that made him remember an ‘apothecary,’ and treat what his servant said as a ‘dream.’ Who but Sh. could have given us the key to these subtle and delicate workings of the human heart?"

        "Halliwell: Mr. Fairholt sends me this note: ‘Romeo’s description of the shop of the poor apothecary may be accepted as minutely accurate, for it was customary with his class “to make a show,” according to their means. Rows of drug-bottles in Majolica, highly decorated by painting, filled their shelves, and are now among the most coveted articles to collectors of “Raffaelle-ware.” The apothecary’s shop was then (as it is now in Italy) the rendezvous for idlers and elderly gossips; hence the proprietor made the best display he could of his own position. Dried fishes and marine monsters were suspended from the ceiling; “an alligator stuff’d” was the most coveted and indispensable of all; and we rarely meet with any representation of the shop of the humblest medical practitioner without one. In Dutch art they abound. Our cut represents that of a village barber-surgeon after one of Teniers best pictures.’"

Warton, in his History of English Poetry, has described the learning, the magnificence, and the prodigious influence of this remarkable body. Friar Laurence was able to give to Romeo ‘Adversity’s sweet milk—philosophy.’ He was to Romeo ‘a divine, a ghostly confessor, A sin-absolver, and my friend professed,’ but he was yet of the world. He married Romeo and his mistress, partly to gratify their love, and partly to secure his influence in the reconciliation of their families. Warton says the Franciscans ‘managed the machines of every important operation or event, both in the religious and political world.’ Mal. So in Romeus and Juliet; ‘Apace our frier John to Mantua him hyes; And, for because in Italy it is a wonted gyse That friers in the towne should seeldome walke alone, But of theyr covent ay should he accompanied with one Of his profession, straight a house he fyndeth out, In mynd to take some frier with him, to walke the towne about.* Our author, having occasion for Friar John, has here departed from the poem, and supposed the pestilence to rage at Verona, instead of Mantua.

We have nothing in England which corresponds to this scene, and^no monument or vault in which scenes such as this could be exhibited. Coryat, who could often be worse spared than a better man, writes thus: 'I saw the monuments of two of the noble Scaligers of Verona in a little churchyard adjoining to tha church called Mana Anliqua; the fairest whereof is that of Mastinus Scaliger, standing at one corner of the churchyard, which is such an exceeding sumptuous mausoleum that I saw not the like in Italy. The other monument is that of Canis Grandi, or Magnus Scaliger, which stood within another corner of the same churchyard, right opposite unto this.' Crudities^ vol. ii, p. 114. Sing. (ed. 2). The Lovers are said to have been buried in the SotterrAneo of Fermo Maggiore, belonging to an order of Franciscans.

        "Johnson: dear employment] That is, action of importance, [Sing, Steev. Ben Jonson uses the word dear in the same sense in Catiline, Act I: ‘Put your known talents on so dear a business.’ [Sing, Singer [Note on Twelfth Night, V, i, 74: ‘in terms so bloody and so dear’]. Tooke has so admirably accounted for the epithet dear applied by our ancient writers to any object which excites a sensation of /turt^ pain, and consequently of anxiety^ solicitude, care, earnestness, that I shall extract it as the best comment iqion the apparently opposite uses of the word in our great poet: ^Deai'th is the third person singular of the English (from the Anglo-Saxon verb Derian, noccre, la;dere), to dere. It means some or any season, weather, or other cause, which dcreth, i. e., maketh dear, liurteth, or doth mischief. The English verb to dcr'e was formerly in common use.* He then produces about twenty examples, the last from Hamlet [I, ii, 1B2]; ‘Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven,’ &c. Tooke continues: ‘Johnson and Malone, who trusted to their Latin to explain his (Sh.’s) English, for diVtfr and deerest would have us read dire and direst; not knowing that Dere and Deriend mean hurt and hurting, mischief and mischievous; and that their Latin dims is from our Anglo-Saxon Dere, which they would expunge.’ Epca Pteroenta, vol. ii, p. 409. A most pertinent illustration of Tooke’s etymology has occurred ta me in a MS. poem by Richard Rolle the Hermit of Hampole: * Bot flaterinR lele and loselry,, Is grete chepe in thair courtes namly. The most derihe of any, that is Aboute tham there, is solhfastnes.*——Vita. Dyce [quotes the foregoing and adds]: See, too, Richardson’s Diet., where Tooke’s explanation of dear is given as the true one. Caldecott [Note on ‘my dearest foe,’ Hamlet I, ii, 182]. Throughout Sh., and all the poets of his and a much later day, we find this epithet applied to the person or thing which, for or against us, excites the liveliest and strongest interest. It is used variously, indefinitely, and metaphorically to express the warmest feelings of the soul; its nearest, most intimate, home and heart-felt emotions: and here, no doubt, though, as everywhere else, more directly interpreted, signifying ‘veriest, extremest,’ must by consequence and figuratively import ‘bitterest, deadliest, most mortal.’ As extremes are said, in a certain sense, to approximate, and are in many respects alike or the same, so this word is made, in a certain sense, to carry with it an union of the fiercest opposites: it is made to signify the extremes of love and hatred. It may be said to be equivalent generally to very, and to import * the excess, the utmost, the superlative’ of that, whatever it may be, to which it is applied. But to suppose, with Tooke {^Divers, of Puidey, ii, 409), that in all cases dear must at that time have meant ‘injurious,* as being derived from the Saxon verb dere, to hurt, is perfectly absurd. Dr. Johnson’s derivation of the word, as used in this place, from the Latin dims, is doubtless ridiculous enough; but Tooke has not produced a single instance of it, i, e., of the adjective, in the sense upon which he insists, except, as he pretends, from our author, &c. [Dyce. Craik [‘The English of Sh.* p. 237: ‘Shall it not grieve thee, dearer than thy death?’—Jul. Cajs., HI, i, 196]. Horne Tooke (*Div. of Purley^ 612, &c.) makes a plausible case in fuvour of dear being derived from the ancient verb derian, to hurt, to annoy, and of its proper meaning being, therefore, injurious or hateful. His notion seems to be that from Jiis derian we have dearth^ meaning properly that sort of injury that is done by the weather, and that, a usual consequence of dearth being to make the produce of the earth high-priced, the adjective dear has thence taken its common meaning of precious. This is not all distinctly asserted, but what of it may not be explicitly set forth is supposed and implied. It is, however, against an explanation which has been generally accepted, that there is no appearance of connection between derian and the contemporary word answering tc dear in the sense of high-priced, precious, beloved, which is deore^ diire^ or dyre^ and is evidently from the same root, not with derian, but with deoran or dyran, to hold dear, to love. There is no doubt about the existence of an old English verb dere, meaning to hurt, the unquestionable representative of the original derian. Thus in Chaucer (C 7T 1824), Theseus says to Palamon and Arcite, in the Knight’s Tale; * And ye shul bothe anon unto me swere That never mo ye shul my contree dere, Ne maken werre upon me night ne day. But ben my frendes in alle that ye may.’ But perhaps we can get most easily and naturally at the sense which dear sometimes assumes by supposing that the notion properly involved in it of love, having first become generalized into that of a strong affection of any kind, had thence passed on into that of such an emotion the very reverse of love. We seem to have it in the intermediate sense in such instances as the following: ‘Some dear cause Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.’—Lear, IV, iii, 53. [The present line cited.] And even when Hamlet speaks of his *dearest foe,' or when Celia remarks to Rosalind, in As You Like It, I, iii, 31, ‘My father hated his [Orlando’s] father dearly^ the word need not be understood as implying more than strong or passionate emotion.

Again, in Westward for Smelts, 1C20: ‘the king sent for the wounded man intc the presence* [Hal. Steev.

Verp. Nares. The state-room in a palace, where the sovereign usually appears. Hence used also for any grand state-room. [^Sfa. Hunter. It is here used for ‘presence-chamber,’ the hall of audience, the most splendid apartment of a royal palace. ‘The next chamber within it, which is the presence, very fair.’—Coryat, Crudities, vol. i, p. 32. A longer quotation may be excused for the rareness of the source from whence it comes, and the curious theatri-cal information it contains:—John Chamberlayne, writing to Sir Dudley Carleton, from London, January 5th, 1608, says: ‘The Marquess goes forward at court the twelfth day, though I doubt the new room will be scant ready. All the holidays there were Plays, but with so little concourse of strangers that they say they wanted company. The King was very earnest to have one on Christmas Night, though, as I take it. He and the Prince received sacrament that day; but the Lords told him that it was not the fashion, which answer pleased him not a whit, but said, “What do you tell me of the fashion? I will make it a fashion.” Yesterday he dined in the Presence, in great ponij:), with his rich cupboards of plate, the one of gold, the other that of the House of Burgundy, pawned to Queen Elizabeth by the States of Brabant, and hath seldom been seen abroad, being exceeding massy, fair, and sumptuous. I could learn no reason of this extraordinary bravery, but that he would shew himself in glory to certain Scots that were never here before, as they sa> there be many lately come, and that the Court is full of new and strange faces.’—From a copy of the Original in the State Paper Office. It shows us something of the splendour of a Presence contrasting with the dark and dismal sepulchral vault. Dyce. I find that Evelyn in his Diary, under 1668, speaks of himself as ‘Standing by his Ma*y [Charles II] at dinner in the Presence.*"

The curious reader will not fail to observe that the ideas drawn from the Stars^ the Law, and the Sea succeed each other in both speeches, in the same order, though with a different application. The bitter cause of Romeo’s death is to be found in the latter speech, though I am well aware that the word bitterly [I, iv, 108] was suggested to the Poet by the impression on his mind of the peculiar species of death which he had himself destined for the character, and that it was not intentionally selected for the purpose of attributing to Romeo a presentiment of the mode by which the date of his existence was to expire.

        "Malone: Thy husband ... dead] Shakespeare has been arraigned for departing from the Italian novel, in making Romeo die before Juliet awakes, and thus losing a happy opportunity of introducing an affecting scene. But he undoubtedly had never read the Italian novel, or any literal translation of it, and was misled by the poem of Romeus and Juliet, which departs from the Italian story in this regard. Huds. Sing. Schlegel remarks that ‘the poet seems to have hit upon what was best. There is a measure of agitation, beyond which all that is superadded becomes torture, or glides off ineffectually from the already saturated mind. In case of the cruel reunion of the lovers for an instant, Romeo’s remorse for his over-hasty self-murder, Juliet’s despair over her deceitful hope, at first cherished, then annihilated, that she was at the goal of her wishes, must have deviated into caricatures. Nobody surely doubts that Shakespeare was able to represent these with suitable force; but here everything soothing was welcome in order that we may not be frightened out of the melancholy, to which we willingly resign ourselves, by too painful discords. Why should we heap still more upon accident, that is already so guilty? Wherefore shall not the tortured Romeo quietly ‘Shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From his world-wearied flesh?’ He holds his beloved in his arms, and, dying, cheers himself with a vision of everlasting marriage. She also seeks death, in a kiss, upon his lips. These last moments must belong unparticipated to tenderness, that we may hold fast to the thought, that love lives, although the lovers perish. [Verp.

        "Malone: the watch] It has been objected that there is no such establishment in Italy. Shakespeare seldom scrupled to give the manners and usages of his own country to others. In this particular instance the old poem was his guide: ‘The wery watch discharg’d did hye them home to sleep.’ Again: ‘The watchemen of the towne the whilst are passed by, And through the gates the candlelight within the tombe they spye.’ Steevens: In Much Ado, where the scene lies at Messina, Shakespeare has also introduced watchmen, though without suggestion from any dull poem like that just referred to. See, however, Othello, I, ii, in which Malone appears to contradict, on the strongest evidence, the present assertion relating to there being no watch in Italy. Brown [‘SP’s Autobiog.

        "Steevens: there rest] The alteration from rest in (Q1) to rust in was probably made by Shakespeare when he introduced the words, ‘This is thy sheath'. Dyce: 'Rest' appears to me the more natural expression: at such a moment the thoughts of Juliet were not likely to wander away to the future rusting of the dagger; she only wishes it, by resting in her bosom as in its sheath, to give her instant death. [Huds. Coll. (ed. 2). Lettsom. True. [MS. marginal note in the present editor’s copy of the above.] White (‘Shaks. Scholar’). ‘There nest' is an obvious misprint for ‘There rest.' Dyce (ed. i).

Rtest is altered to ‘rest’ in the (MS.), which word we, on all accounts, prefer. [Dyce quoted.] It may be added that if short-hand were employed in the original publication of this play, the words ‘rest’ and rust would be spelt with the same letters. White. When I was green in judgment, I hastily agreed that ‘rust’ is a misprint, Juliet's thoughts do not, as Dyce says, wander: they go forward, though not to the literal end. Her imagination is excited, and, looking beyond her suicidal act, she sees her dead Romeo's dagger, which would otherwise rust in its sheath, rusting in her heart; and, with fierce and amorous joy, she cries, ‘This is thy sheath; there rust and let me die.’ Clarke. The expression, ‘Oh, happy dagger,’ though meaning, ‘Oh, happily-found dagger!’ ‘opportune dagger!’ yet conveys an included sense that is in keeping with the word ‘rest,’ which also affords antithetical effect with ‘let me die!' Poetically calling her bosom the ‘sheath’ to Romeo’s dagger, ‘rest’ seems more in harmony than ‘rust’ with the image presented. [The Tragedy here ends in Booth’s Acting Copy.] Ed.",

I consider this change as one which the (MS.) made out of whole cloth: he might have thought that ‘outrage’ was too strong a phrase to apply to what old Montague has just said. This is certainly true; but on the other hand, the ‘mouth of outcry’ is sheer tautology, and is besides a very strong expression, as it is scarcely to be assumed that old Montague had really ‘shrieked out.’ At all events, the emendation, if it be one, is unimportant.

(Compare Shakespeare's Dramatic Art, p. 359.)

Notice in this speech in (Q2) the idioms ‘whereas’ and ‘for to,’ which Shakespeare seems so sedulously to have avoided, and which, it should be observed, are found in all the surreptitious and mutilated versions of his plays, and disappear in the authentic eds."

        "Allen Notes on The Tempest. Minutes of the Sh. Soc. of Phila., 1866, p. 12.: as this] Temp. I, ii, 70, ‘as, at that time’). By removing the comma we get an expression precisely equivalent to the as-at-this-time in the Prayer-Book Collect for Christmas, which (thirty odd years ago) I settled in my mind (against the commentators) must be a more or less precise and emphatic now. I considered, namely, that at-this-time was simply equal to now; that as-at-this-time was equal to as-now or now-as; and that now-as would be one of the correlatives of the recognized whenas. It was easy enough to go further and say, that as-at-that-time would be equal to as-then or then-as; and that then-as would be the other correlative of whenas. I did not, indeed, imagine that either now-as and then-as, or as-now and as-then, could be found in any of our old authors; but Johnson taught me that as how was used by so late a writer as Addison, and I remembered that the exact equivalent of as then was current in German, under the form of alsdann. There was reason to believe, therefore, that more such adverbial forms, with as prefixed or suffixed—perhaps, even, systems of correlatives with as (analogous to whereby and thereby, &c.)—once existed in the old colloquial language of both England and Germany. Turning to the Deutsches Wörterbuch of the brothers Grimm, I not only found (vol. i, p. 258a’) that als (= as) was used with such Adverbs as yesterday, to-day to-morrow, &c., in Opitz and other old authors, and to this day (vol. i, p. 247a) in the spoken language of the Rhine and Main lands, but also perceived that a similar use of as in English was known to these German philologists. Verifying this statement, I met in Chaucer’s Legende of Goode Women (so admirably edited by Prof. Corson), ‘This thoghte hire was felicite as here’ (2587), ‘us nedeth trewely Nothing as nend’ (1491), ‘As-hi-that-poynt ... Thou folwest him certayn’ (2547), and ‘as-in-love trusteth no man but me’ (2568). Professor Corson’s MS. Select Glossary of La Morte d'Arthur (kindly lent me) furnishes seventeen examples, including not only as at this time and as at that time, as to-night and as to-morrow, but also as at bed and at board. In the Paston Letters (Bohn’s ed., vol. ii, p. 156), the Duke of Norfolk writes that ‘the King would have set forth as upon Monday;’ and in the Homily for Good Friday (near the beginning) we have ‘as about this time.’ As then occurs also in Jeremy Taylor’s ‘Sermon on the Marriage-Ring:’ ‘because as then it was, when they were to flie.’ Nor is the passage in The Temp, absolutely the only one in which Shakespeare so uses as: in Meas. for Meas., V, i, 70, Isabella declares Lucio to have been ‘as then the messenger;’ in Sonn. xlvi, ‘The clear eye’s moiety and the dear heart’s part’ is determined ‘as thus;’ and the reading of in Twelfth Night, II, ii, 33, may stand, if we consider ‘such as’ to be a composite form equivalent to ‘precisely such;’ ‘Alas! our frailty is the cause, not we; For such-as we are made, if such we be?’ Abbott (Shakespearian Grammar’ 1870, p. 79). As is apparently used redundantly with definitions of time (as oh is used in Greek with respect to motion). It is said by Halliwell to be an Eastern Counties’ phrase: ‘This is my birthday, as this very day Was Cassius born.’—Jul. Caes., V, i, 72; Meas. for Meas., V, i, 74. The as in the first example may be intended to qualify the statement that Cassius was born on ‘this very day,’ which is not literally true, as meaning ‘as I may say.’ Here, and in our Collect for Christmas Day, ‘as at this time to be born,’ as seems appropriate to an anniversary. In the second example the meaning of ‘as then’ is not so clear. Perhaps it means ‘as far as regards that occasion.’ Compare ‘Yet God at last To Satan, first in sin, his doom applied, Though in mysterious terms, judged as then best’—Milton, P. L., x, 173,“ where ‘as then’ seems to mean ‘for the present.’ So ‘as yet’ means ‘as far as regards time up to the present time.’ So in German, ‘als dann’ means ‘then,’ and ‘als’ is applied to other temporal adverbs. As in Early English was often prefixed to dates: ‘As in the year of grace,’ &c. ‘As now’ is often used in Chaucer and earlier writers for ‘as regards now,’ ‘for the present:’ ‘But al that thing I must as now forbere.’—Chauc., Knights Tale, 27. In Rom. and Jul., V, iii, 246, as perhaps means ‘as (he did come).’"

        "Steevens: Than this, &c.] Shakespeare has not effected the alteration of this play by introducing any new incidents, but merely by adding to the length of the scenes. The piece appears to have been always a very popular one. Marston, in his Satires, 1598, says: ‘Luscus, what’s play’d to day?—faith, now I know I set thy lips abroach, from whence doth flow Nought but pure Juliet and Romeo.’ [Sing.] Mal. These lines seem to have been formed on the concluding couplet of the poem of Romeus and Juliet; ‘among the monumentes that in Verona been. There is no monument more worthy of the sight. Then is the tombe of Juliet and Romeus her knight’ [Sing.]. Dr. Johnson: This play is one of the most pleasing of our author’s performances. The scenes are busy and various, the incidents numerous and important, the catastrophe irresistibly affecting, and the process of the action carried on with such probability, at least with such congruity to popular opinions, as tragedy requires. Here is one of the few attempts of Shakespeare to exhibit the conversation of gentlemen, to represent the airy sprightliness of juvenile elegance. Dryden mentions a tradition, which might easily reach his time, of a declaration made by Shakespeare, that he was obliged to kill Mercutio in the third Act, lest he should have been killed by him. Yet he thinks him no such formidable person but that he ought to have lived through the play, and died in his bed, without danger to the poet. Dryden well knew, had he been in quest of truth, in a pointed sentence, that more regard is commonly had to the words than the thought, and that it is very seldom to be rigorously understood. Mercutio’s wit, gaiety, and courage will always procure him friends that wish him a longer life: but his death is not precipitated, he has lived out the time allotted him in the construction of the play; nor do I doubt the ability of Shakespeare to have continued his existence, though some of his sallies are perhaps out of the reach of Dryden, whose genius was not very fertile in merriment, nor ductile to humour, but acute, argumentative, comprehensive, and sublime. The Nurse is one of the characters in which the author delighted; he has, with great subtility of distinction, drawn her at once loquacious and secret, obsequious and insolent, trusty and dishonest. His comic scenes are happily wrought, but his pathetic strains are always polluted with some unexpected depravations. His persons, however distressed, have a conceit left them in their misery—a miserable conceit. Steevens: This last quotation of Dr. Johnson’s is also found in the Preface to Dryden’s Fables; ‘Just John Littlewit in Bartholomew Fair, who had a conceit (as he tells you) left him in his misery; a miserable conceit.’ Singer: This last remark of Dr. Johnson’s has been answered at length, and, as I think, satisfactorily, by A. W. Schlegel in a detailed criticism of this tragedy, published in the Horen, a journal conducted by Schiller in 1794-1795, and made accessible to the English reader in Ollier’s Literary Miscellany, Part I. In his Lectures on Dramatic Literature (vol. ii, p. 135, Eng. trans.) will be found some further sensible remarks upon the ‘conceits’ here stigmatized. It should be remembered that playing on words was a very favorite species of wit combat with our ancestors. ‘With children, as well as nations of the most simple manners, a great inclination to playing on words is often displayed [they cannot therefore be both puerile and unnatural. If the first charge is founded the second cannot be so]. In Homer we find several examples: the Books of Moses, the oldest written memorial of the primitive world, are, it is well known, full of them. On the other hand, poets of a very cultivated taste, or orators like Cicero, have delighted in them. Whoever in Richard the Second is disgusted with the affecting play of words of the dying John of Gaunt on his own name, let him remember that the same thing occurs in the Ajax of Sophocles. Coleridge (Lit. Rem. vol. ii, p. 77): The stage in Shakespeare’s time was a naked room with a blanket for a curtain; but he made it a field for monarchs. That law of unity which has its foundations, not in the factitious necessity of custom, but in nature itself, the unity of feeling, is everywhere and at all times observed by Shakespeare in his plays. Read Romeo and Juliet; all is youth and spring; youth with its follies, its virtues, its precipitancies; spring with its odours, its flowers, and its transiency, it is one and the same feeling that commences, goes through, and ends the play. The old men, the Capulets and the Montagues, are not common old men; they have an eagerness, a heartiness, a vehemence, the effect of spring; with Romeo, his change of passion, his sudden marriage, and his rash death are all the effects of youth; whilst in Juliet love has all that is tender and melancholy in the nightingale, all that is voluptuous in the rose, with whatever is sweet in the freshness of spring; but it ends with a long, deep sigh like the last breeze of the Italian evening. This unity of feeling and character pervades every drama of Shakespeare. Schlegel: Whatever is most intoxicating in the odour of a southern spring, languishing in the song of the nightingale, or voluptuous in the first opening of the rose, is breathed into this poem. But even more rapidly than the earliest blossoms of youth and beauty decay, it hurries on from the first timidly-bold declaration of love and modest return to the most unlimited passion, to an irrevocable union: then, amidst alternating storms of rapture and despair, to the death of the two lovers, who still appear enviable as their love survives them, and as by their death they have obtained a triumph over every separating power. The sweetest and the bitterest, love and hatred, festivity and dark forebodings, tender embraces and sepulchres, the fulness of life and self-annihilation, are all here brought close to each other; and all these contrasts are so blended, in the harmonious and beautiful work, into a unity of impression that the echo which the whole leaves behind in the mind resembles a single but endless sigh. Hazlitt: This description [of Schlegel’s] is true, and yet it does not come up to our idea of the play. For if it has the sweetness of the rose, it has its freshness too; if it has the languor of the nightingale’s song, it has also its giddy transport; if it has the softness of a southern spring, it is as glowing and as bright. There is nothing of a sickly, sentimental cast. Romeo and Juliet are in love but they are not love-sick. Everything speaks the very soul of pleasure, the high and healthy pulse of the passions; the heart beats and the blood circulates and mantles throughout. Their courtship is not an insipid interchange of sentiments lip-deep, learnt at second-hand from poems and plays—made up of beauties of the most shadowy kind, of ‘fancies wan,’ of evanescent smiles and sighs that breathe not, of delicacy that shrinks from the touch, and feebleness that scarce supports itself, an elaborate vacuity of thought, and an artificial dearth of sense, spirit, truth, and nature! It is the reverse of all this. It is Shakespeare all over, and Shakespeare when he was young. Hartley Coleridge. Essays, &c., vol. ii, p. 198): There is something hasty and inconsiderate in these last scenes. Perhaps no human genius can grapple with such aggregated disaster. Words cannot express the horror of such judicial calamities which overswell the capacity of conscious grief, and must needs produce madness or stupefaction, or, likely enough, demoniac scorn and laughter. The reconciliation of the parents seems to me more moral than natural. I doubt if real hatred is ever cured. As for the golden statues, they are not so good a monument as the sweetbriars growing from the common grave of hapless lovers in so many old ballads. Garrick has certainly deepened and humanized the pathos by making Juliet awake before Romeo dies, which I believe is according to the original story. Chambers: Byron, in one of his letters to Moore, says: Of the truth of Juliet’s story they (the Veronese) seem tenacious to a degree,—insisting on the fact, giving a date (1303), and showing a tomb. It is a plain, open, and partly decayed sarcophagus, with withered leaves in it, in a wild and desolate conventual garden, once a cemetery, now ruined to the very graves. The situation struck me as very appropriate to the legend, being blighted as their love. ."
