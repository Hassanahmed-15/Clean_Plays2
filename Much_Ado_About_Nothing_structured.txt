ACT 1 SCENE 1

1: LEONATO: I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon
2: comes this night to Messina.
3: Messenger: He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off
4: when I left him.
5: LEONATO: How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
6: Messenger: But few of any sort, and none of name.
7: LEONATO: A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings
8: home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath
9: bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.
10: Messenger: Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by
11: Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the
12: promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,
13: the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better
14: bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
15: tell you how.
16: LEONATO: He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much
17: glad of it.
18: Messenger: I have already delivered him letters, and there
19: appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could
20: not show itself modest enough without a badge of
21: bitterness.
22: LEONATO: Did he break out into tears?
23: Messenger: In great measure.
24: LEONATO: A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces
25: truer than those that are so washed. How much
26: better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!
27: BEATRICE: I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the
28: wars or no?
29: Messenger: I know none of that name, lady: there was none such
30: in the army of any sort.
31: LEONATO: What is he that you ask for, niece?
32: HERO: My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
33: Messenger: O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.
34: BEATRICE: He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged
35: Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading
36: the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged
37: him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he
38: killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath
39: he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.
40: LEONATO: Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;
41: but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.
42: Messenger: He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.
43: BEATRICE: You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:
44: he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an
45: excellent stomach.
46: Messenger: And a good soldier too, lady.
47: BEATRICE: And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?
48: Messenger: A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all
49: honourable virtues.
50: BEATRICE: It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:
51: but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.
52: LEONATO: You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a
53: kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:
54: they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit
55: between them.
56: BEATRICE: Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last
57: conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and
58: now is the whole man governed with one: so that if
59: he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him
60: bear it for a difference between himself and his
61: horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,
62: to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his
63: companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.
64: Messenger: Is't possible?
65: BEATRICE: Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as
66: the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the
67: next block.
68: Messenger: I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.
69: BEATRICE: No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray
70: you, who is his companion? Is there no young
71: squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?
72: Messenger: He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.
73: BEATRICE: O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he
74: is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker
75: runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if
76: he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a
77: thousand pound ere a' be cured.
78: Messenger: I will hold friends with you, lady.
79: BEATRICE: Do, good friend.
80: LEONATO: You will never run mad, niece.
81: BEATRICE: No, not till a hot January.
82: Messenger: Don Pedro is approached.
83: DON PEDRO: Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your
84: trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid
85: cost, and you encounter it.
86: LEONATO: Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of
87: your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should
88: remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides
89: and happiness takes his leave.
90: DON PEDRO: You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this
91: is your daughter.
92: LEONATO: Her mother hath many times told me so.
93: BENEDICK: Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?
94: LEONATO: Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.
95: DON PEDRO: You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this
96: what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers
97: herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an
98: honourable father.
99: BENEDICK: If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not
100: have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as
101: like him as she is.
102: BEATRICE: I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior
103: Benedick: nobody marks you.
104: BENEDICK: What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?
105: BEATRICE: Is it possible disdain should die while she hath
106: such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?
107: Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come
108: in her presence.
109: BENEDICK: Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I
110: am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I
111: would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard
112: heart; for, truly, I love none.
113: BEATRICE: A dear happiness to women: they would else have
114: been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God
115: and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I
116: had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man
117: swear he loves me.
118: BENEDICK: God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some
119: gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate
120: scratched face.
121: BEATRICE: Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such
122: a face as yours were.
123: BENEDICK: Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.
124: BEATRICE: A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
125: BENEDICK: I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and
126: so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's
127: name; I have done.
128: BEATRICE: You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.
129: DON PEDRO: That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio
130: and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath
131: invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at
132: the least a month; and he heartily prays some
133: occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no
134: hypocrite, but prays from his heart.
135: LEONATO: If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.
136: Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to
137: the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.
138: DON JOHN: I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank
139: you.
140: LEONATO: Please it your grace lead on?
141: DON PEDRO: Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.
142: CLAUDIO: Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?
143: BENEDICK: I noted her not; but I looked on her.
144: CLAUDIO: Is she not a modest young lady?
145: BENEDICK: Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for
146: my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak
147: after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?
148: CLAUDIO: No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.
149: BENEDICK: Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high
150: praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little
151: for a great praise: only this commendation I can
152: afford her, that were she other than she is, she
153: were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I
154: do not like her.
155: CLAUDIO: Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me
156: truly how thou likest her.
157: BENEDICK: Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?
158: CLAUDIO: Can the world buy such a jewel?
159: BENEDICK: Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this
160: with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,
161: to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a
162: rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take
163: you, to go in the song?
164: CLAUDIO: In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I
165: looked on.
166: BENEDICK: I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such
167: matter: there's her cousin, an she were not
168: possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty
169: as the first of May doth the last of December. But I
170: hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?
171: CLAUDIO: I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the
172: contrary, if Hero would be my wife.
173: BENEDICK: Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world
174: one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?
175: Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?
176: Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck
177: into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away
178: Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.
179: DON PEDRO: What secret hath held you here, that you followed
180: not to Leonato's?
181: BENEDICK: I would your grace would constrain me to tell.
182: DON PEDRO: I charge thee on thy allegiance.
183: BENEDICK: You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb
184: man; I would have you think so; but, on my
185: allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is
186: in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.
187: Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero, Leonato's
188: short daughter.
189: CLAUDIO: If this were so, so were it uttered.
190: BENEDICK: Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor
191: 'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be
192: so.'
193: CLAUDIO: If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it
194: should be otherwise.
195: DON PEDRO: Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.
196: CLAUDIO: You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
197: DON PEDRO: By my troth, I speak my thought.
198: CLAUDIO: And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.
199: BENEDICK: And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.
200: CLAUDIO: That I love her, I feel.
201: DON PEDRO: That she is worthy, I know.
202: BENEDICK: That I neither feel how she should be loved nor
203: know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that
204: fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.
205: DON PEDRO: Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite
206: of beauty.
207: CLAUDIO: And never could maintain his part but in the force
208: of his will.
209: BENEDICK: That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she
210: brought me up, I likewise give her most humble
211: thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my
212: forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,
213: all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do
214: them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the
215: right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which
216: I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.
217: DON PEDRO: I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.
218: BENEDICK: With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,
219: not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood
220: with love than I will get again with drinking, pick
221: out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me
222: up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of
223: blind Cupid.
224: DON PEDRO: Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou
225: wilt prove a notable argument.
226: BENEDICK: If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot
227: at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on
228: the shoulder, and called Adam.
229: DON PEDRO: Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull
230: doth bear the yoke.'
231: BENEDICK: The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible
232: Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set
233: them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,
234: and in such great letters as they write 'Here is
235: good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign
236: 'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'
237: CLAUDIO: If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.
238: DON PEDRO: Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in
239: Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.
240: BENEDICK: I look for an earthquake too, then.
241: DON PEDRO: Well, you temporize with the hours. In the
242: meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to
243: Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will
244: not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made
245: great preparation.
246: BENEDICK: I have almost matter enough in me for such an
247: embassage; and so I commit you--
248: CLAUDIO: To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,--
249: DON PEDRO: The sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.
250: BENEDICK: Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your
251: discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and
252: the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere
253: you flout old ends any further, examine your
254: conscience: and so I leave you.
255: CLAUDIO: My liege, your highness now may do me good.
256: DON PEDRO: My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,
257: And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
258: Any hard lesson that may do thee good.
259: CLAUDIO: Hath Leonato any son, my lord?
260: DON PEDRO: No child but Hero; she's his only heir.
261: Dost thou affect her, Claudio?
262: CLAUDIO: O, my lord,
263: When you went onward on this ended action,
264: I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,
265: That liked, but had a rougher task in hand
266: Than to drive liking to the name of love:
267: But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts
268: Have left their places vacant, in their rooms
269: Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
270: All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
271: Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.
272: DON PEDRO: Thou wilt be like a lover presently
273: And tire the hearer with a book of words.
274: If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,
275: And I will break with her and with her father,
276: And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end
277: That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?
278: CLAUDIO: How sweetly you do minister to love,
279: That know love's grief by his complexion!
280: But lest my liking might too sudden seem,
281: I would have salved it with a longer treatise.
282: DON PEDRO: What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
283: The fairest grant is the necessity.
284: Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,
285: And I will fit thee with the remedy.
286: I know we shall have revelling to-night:
287: I will assume thy part in some disguise
288: And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
289: And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
290: And take her hearing prisoner with the force
291: And strong encounter of my amorous tale:
292: Then after to her father will I break;
293: And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
294: In practise let us put it presently.
ACT 1 SCENE 2

1: LEONATO: How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son?
2: hath he provided this music?
3: ANTONIO: He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell
4: you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.
5: LEONATO: Are they good?
6: ANTONIO: As the event stamps them: but they have a good
7: cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count
8: Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine
9: orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:
10: the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my
11: niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it
12: this night in a dance: and if he found her
13: accordant, he meant to take the present time by the
14: top and instantly break with you of it.
15: LEONATO: Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
16: ANTONIO: A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and
17: question him yourself.
18: LEONATO: No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear
19: itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,
20: that she may be the better prepared for an answer,
21: if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.
22: Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry you
23: mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your
24: skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.
ACT 1 SCENE 3

1: CONRADE: What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out
2: of measure sad?
3: DON JOHN: There is no measure in the occasion that breeds;
4: therefore the sadness is without limit.
5: CONRADE: You should hear reason.
6: DON JOHN: And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?
7: CONRADE: If not a present remedy, at least a patient
8: sufferance.
9: DON JOHN: I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,
10: born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral
11: medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide
12: what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile
13: at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait
14: for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and
15: tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and
16: claw no man in his humour.
17: CONRADE: Yea, but you must not make the full show of this
18: till you may do it without controlment. You have of
19: late stood out against your brother, and he hath
20: ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is
21: impossible you should take true root but by the
22: fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful
23: that you frame the season for your own harvest.
24: DON JOHN: I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in
25: his grace, and it better fits my blood to be
26: disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob
27: love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to
28: be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied
29: but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with
30: a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I
31: have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my
32: mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do
33: my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and
34: seek not to alter me.
35: CONRADE: Can you make no use of your discontent?
36: DON JOHN: I make all use of it, for I use it only.
37: Who comes here?
38: What news, Borachio?
39: BORACHIO: I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your
40: brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I
41: can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.
42: DON JOHN: Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?
43: What is he for a fool that betroths himself to
44: unquietness?
45: BORACHIO: Marry, it is your brother's right hand.
46: DON JOHN: Who? the most exquisite Claudio?
47: BORACHIO: Even he.
48: DON JOHN: A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks
49: he?
50: BORACHIO: Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.
51: DON JOHN: A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?
52: BORACHIO: Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a
53: musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand
54: in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the
55: arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the
56: prince should woo Hero for himself, and having
57: obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.
58: DON JOHN: Come, come, let us thither: this may prove food to
59: my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the
60: glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I
61: bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?
62: CONRADE: To the death, my lord.
63: DON JOHN: Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the
64: greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of
65: my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?
ACT 2 SCENE 1

1: LEONATO: Was not Count John here at supper?
2: ANTONIO: I saw him not.
3: BEATRICE: How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see
4: him but I am heart-burned an hour after.
5: HERO: He is of a very melancholy disposition.
6: BEATRICE: He were an excellent man that were made just in the
7: midway between him and Benedick: the one is too
8: like an image and says nothing, and the other too
9: like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.
10: LEONATO: Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's
11: mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior
12: Benedick's face,--
13: BEATRICE: With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money
14: enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman
15: in the world, if a' could get her good-will.
16: LEONATO: By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a
17: husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.
18: ANTONIO: In faith, she's too curst.
19: BEATRICE: Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's
20: sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst
21: cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.
22: LEONATO: So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.
23: BEATRICE: Just, if he send me no husband; for the which
24: blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and
25: evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a
26: beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.
27: LEONATO: You may light on a husband that hath no beard.
28: BEATRICE: What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel
29: and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a
30: beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no
31: beard is less than a man: and he that is more than
32: a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a
33: man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take
34: sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his
35: apes into hell.
36: LEONATO: Well, then, go you into hell?
37: BEATRICE: No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet
38: me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and
39: say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to
40: heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver
41: I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the
42: heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and
43: there live we as merry as the day is long.
44: ANTONIO: [To HERO] Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled
45: by your father.
46: BEATRICE: Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy
47: and say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for all
48: that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else
49: make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please
50: me.'
51: LEONATO: Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.
52: BEATRICE: Not till God make men of some other metal than
53: earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
54: overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make
55: an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?
56: No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;
57: and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.
58: LEONATO: Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince
59: do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.
60: BEATRICE: The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be
61: not wooed in good time: if the prince be too
62: important, tell him there is measure in every thing
63: and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:
64: wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,
65: a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot
66: and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as
67: fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a
68: measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes
69: repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the
70: cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.
71: LEONATO: Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.
72: BEATRICE: I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.
73: LEONATO: The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.
74: DON PEDRO: Lady, will you walk about with your friend?
75: HERO: So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,
76: I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.
77: DON PEDRO: With me in your company?
78: HERO: I may say so, when I please.
79: DON PEDRO: And when please you to say so?
80: HERO: When I like your favour; for God defend the lute
81: should be like the case!
82: DON PEDRO: My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.
83: HERO: Why, then, your visor should be thatched.
84: DON PEDRO: Speak low, if you speak love.
85: BALTHASAR: Well, I would you did like me.
86: MARGARET: So would not I, for your own sake; for I have many
87: ill-qualities.
88: BALTHASAR: Which is one?
89: MARGARET: I say my prayers aloud.
90: BALTHASAR: I love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen.
91: MARGARET: God match me with a good dancer!
92: BALTHASAR: Amen.
93: MARGARET: And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is
94: done! Answer, clerk.
95: BALTHASAR: No more words: the clerk is answered.
96: URSULA: I know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio.
97: ANTONIO: At a word, I am not.
98: URSULA: I know you by the waggling of your head.
99: ANTONIO: To tell you true, I counterfeit him.
100: URSULA: You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were
101: the very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: you
102: are he, you are he.
103: ANTONIO: At a word, I am not.
104: URSULA: Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your
105: excellent wit? can virtue hide itself? Go to,
106: mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there's an
107: end.
108: BEATRICE: Will you not tell me who told you so?
109: BENEDICK: No, you shall pardon me.
110: BEATRICE: Nor will you not tell me who you are?
111: BENEDICK: Not now.
112: BEATRICE: That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit
113: out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this was
114: Signior Benedick that said so.
115: BENEDICK: What's he?
116: BEATRICE: I am sure you know him well enough.
117: BENEDICK: Not I, believe me.
118: BEATRICE: Did he never make you laugh?
119: BENEDICK: I pray you, what is he?
120: BEATRICE: Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;
121: only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:
122: none but libertines delight in him; and the
123: commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany;
124: for he both pleases men and angers them, and then
125: they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in
126: the fleet: I would he had boarded me.
127: BENEDICK: When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.
128: BEATRICE: Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;
129: which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,
130: strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a
131: partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no
132: supper that night.
133: We must follow the leaders.
134: BENEDICK: In every good thing.
135: BEATRICE: Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at
136: the next turning.
137: DON JOHN: Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath
138: withdrawn her father to break with him about it.
139: The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.
140: BORACHIO: And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.
141: DON JOHN: Are not you Signior Benedick?
142: CLAUDIO: You know me well; I am he.
143: DON JOHN: Signior, you are very near my brother in his love:
144: he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him
145: from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may
146: do the part of an honest man in it.
147: CLAUDIO: How know you he loves her?
148: DON JOHN: I heard him swear his affection.
149: BORACHIO: So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.
150: DON JOHN: Come, let us to the banquet.
151: CLAUDIO: Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,
152: But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
153: 'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.
154: Friendship is constant in all other things
155: Save in the office and affairs of love:
156: Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;
157: Let every eye negotiate for itself
158: And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch
159: Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.
160: This is an accident of hourly proof,
161: Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!
162: BENEDICK: Count Claudio?
163: CLAUDIO: Yea, the same.
164: BENEDICK: Come, will you go with me?
165: CLAUDIO: Whither?
166: BENEDICK: Even to the next willow, about your own business,
167: county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?
168: about your neck, like an usurer's chain? or under
169: your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear
170: it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.
171: CLAUDIO: I wish him joy of her.
172: BENEDICK: Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they
173: sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would
174: have served you thus?
175: CLAUDIO: I pray you, leave me.
176: BENEDICK: Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the
177: boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.
178: CLAUDIO: If it will not be, I'll leave you.
179: BENEDICK: Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.
180: But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not
181: know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go
182: under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I
183: am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it
184: is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice
185: that puts the world into her person and so gives me
186: out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.
187: DON PEDRO: Now, signior, where's the count? did you see him?
188: BENEDICK: Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.
189: I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a
190: warren: I told him, and I think I told him true,
191: that your grace had got the good will of this young
192: lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,
193: either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or
194: to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.
195: DON PEDRO: To be whipped! What's his fault?
196: BENEDICK: The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, being
197: overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his
198: companion, and he steals it.
199: DON PEDRO: Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The
200: transgression is in the stealer.
201: BENEDICK: Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,
202: and the garland too; for the garland he might have
203: worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on
204: you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.
205: DON PEDRO: I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to
206: the owner.
207: BENEDICK: If their singing answer your saying, by my faith,
208: you say honestly.
209: DON PEDRO: The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the
210: gentleman that danced with her told her she is much
211: wronged by you.
212: BENEDICK: O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!
213: an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
214: answered her; my very visor began to assume life and
215: scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been
216: myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was
217: duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest
218: with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood
219: like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at
220: me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:
221: if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
222: there were no living near her; she would infect to
223: the north star. I would not marry her, though she
224: were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before
225: he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have
226: turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make
227: the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find
228: her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God
229: some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while
230: she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
231: sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they
232: would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror
233: and perturbation follows her.
234: DON PEDRO: Look, here she comes.
235: BENEDICK: Will your grace command me any service to the
236: world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now
237: to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;
238: I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the
239: furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of
240: Prester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the great
241: Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies,
242: rather than hold three words' conference with this
243: harpy. You have no employment for me?
244: DON PEDRO: None, but to desire your good company.
245: BENEDICK: O God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannot
246: endure my Lady Tongue.
247: DON PEDRO: Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of
248: Signior Benedick.
249: BEATRICE: Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave
250: him use for it, a double heart for his single one:
251: marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,
252: therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.
253: DON PEDRO: You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.
254: BEATRICE: So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I
255: should prove the mother of fools. I have brought
256: Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.
257: DON PEDRO: Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad?
258: CLAUDIO: Not sad, my lord.
259: DON PEDRO: How then? sick?
260: CLAUDIO: Neither, my lord.
261: BEATRICE: The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor
262: well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and
263: something of that jealous complexion.
264: DON PEDRO: I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;
265: though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is
266: false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and
267: fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,
268: and his good will obtained: name the day of
269: marriage, and God give thee joy!
270: LEONATO: Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my
271: fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an
272: grace say Amen to it.
273: BEATRICE: Speak, count, 'tis your cue.
274: CLAUDIO: Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were
275: but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as
276: you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for
277: you and dote upon the exchange.
278: BEATRICE: Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth
279: with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.
280: DON PEDRO: In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.
281: BEATRICE: Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on
282: the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his
283: ear that he is in her heart.
284: CLAUDIO: And so she doth, cousin.
285: BEATRICE: Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the
286: world but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a
287: corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!
288: DON PEDRO: Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.
289: BEATRICE: I would rather have one of your father's getting.
290: Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your
291: father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.
292: DON PEDRO: Will you have me, lady?
293: BEATRICE: No, my lord, unless I might have another for
294: working-days: your grace is too costly to wear
295: every day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I
296: was born to speak all mirth and no matter.
297: DON PEDRO: Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best
298: becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in
299: a merry hour.
300: BEATRICE: No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there
301: was a star danced, and under that was I born.
302: Cousins, God give you joy!
303: LEONATO: Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?
304: BEATRICE: I cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon.
305: DON PEDRO: By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.
306: LEONATO: There's little of the melancholy element in her, my
307: lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, and
308: not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,
309: she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked
310: herself with laughing.
311: DON PEDRO: She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.
312: LEONATO: O, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.
313: DON PEDRO: She were an excellent wife for Benedict.
314: LEONATO: O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,
315: they would talk themselves mad.
316: DON PEDRO: County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?
317: CLAUDIO: To-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches till love
318: have all his rites.
319: LEONATO: Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just
320: seven-night; and a time too brief, too, to have all
321: things answer my mind.
322: DON PEDRO: Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing:
323: but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go
324: dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of
325: Hercules' labours; which is, to bring Signior
326: Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of
327: affection the one with the other. I would fain have
328: it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if
329: you three will but minister such assistance as I
330: shall give you direction.
331: LEONATO: My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten
332: nights' watchings.
333: CLAUDIO: And I, my lord.
334: DON PEDRO: And you too, gentle Hero?
335: HERO: I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my
336: cousin to a good husband.
337: DON PEDRO: And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that
338: I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble
339: strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I
340: will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she
341: shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your
342: two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in
343: despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he
344: shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,
345: Cupid is no longer an archer: hi s glory shall be
346: ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,
347: and I will tell you my drift.
ACT 2 SCENE 2

1: DON JOHN: It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the
2: daughter of Leonato.
3: BORACHIO: Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.
4: DON JOHN: Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be
5: medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,
6: and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges
7: evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?
8: BORACHIO: Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no
9: dishonesty shall appear in me.
10: DON JOHN: Show me briefly how.
11: BORACHIO: I think I told your lordship a year since, how much
12: I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting
13: gentlewoman to Hero.
14: DON JOHN: I remember.
15: BORACHIO: I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,
16: appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.
17: DON JOHN: What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?
18: BORACHIO: The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to
19: the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that
20: he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned
21: Claudio--whose estimation do you mightily hold
22: up--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.
23: DON JOHN: What proof shall I make of that?
24: BORACHIO: Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio,
25: to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for any
26: other issue?
27: DON JOHN: Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.
28: BORACHIO: Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and
29: the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know
30: that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the
31: prince and Claudio, as,--in love of your brother's
32: honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
33: reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the
34: semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered
35: thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:
36: offer them instances; which shall bear no less
37: likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,
38: hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me
39: Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night
40: before the intended wedding,--for in the meantime I
41: will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be
42: absent,--and there shall appear such seeming truth
43: of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called
44: assurance and all the preparation overthrown.
45: DON JOHN: Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put
46: it in practise. Be cunning in the working this, and
47: thy fee is a thousand ducats.
48: BORACHIO: Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning
49: shall not shame me.
50: DON JOHN: I will presently go learn their day of marriage.
ACT 2 SCENE 3

1: BENEDICK: Boy!
2: Boy: Signior?
3: BENEDICK: In my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hither
4: to me in the orchard.
5: Boy: I am here already, sir.
6: BENEDICK: I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.
7: I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much
8: another man is a fool when he dedicates his
9: behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at
10: such shallow follies in others, become the argument
11: of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man
12: is Claudio. I have known when there was no music
13: with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he
14: rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known
15: when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a
16: good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,
17: carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to
18: speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man
19: and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his
20: words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many
21: strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with
22: these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not
23: be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but
24: I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster
25: of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman
26: is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am
27: well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all
28: graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in
29: my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,
30: or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;
31: fair, or I'll never look on her; mild, or come not
32: near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good
33: discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall
34: be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and
35: Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.
36: DON PEDRO: Come, shall we hear this music?
37: CLAUDIO: Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,
38: As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!
39: DON PEDRO: See you where Benedick hath hid himself?
40: CLAUDIO: O, very well, my lord: the music ended,
41: We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.
42: DON PEDRO: Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.
43: BALTHASAR: O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice
44: To slander music any more than once.
45: DON PEDRO: It is the witness still of excellency
46: To put a strange face on his own perfection.
47: I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.
48: BALTHASAR: Because you talk of wooing, I will sing;
49: Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
50: To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,
51: Yet will he swear he loves.
52: DON PEDRO: Now, pray thee, come;
53: Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,
54: Do it in notes.
55: BALTHASAR: Note this before my notes;
56: There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.
57: DON PEDRO: Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks;
58: Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.
59: BENEDICK: Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it
60: not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out
61: of men's bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when
62: all's done.
63: BALTHASAR: Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,
64: Men were deceivers ever,
65: One foot in sea and one on shore,
66: To one thing constant never:
67: Then sigh not so, but let them go,
68: And be you blithe and bonny,
69: Converting all your sounds of woe
70: Into Hey nonny, nonny.
71: Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,
72: Of dumps so dull and heavy;
73: The fraud of men was ever so,
74: Since summer first was leafy:
75: Then sigh not so, & c.
76: DON PEDRO: By my troth, a good song.
77: BALTHASAR: And an ill singer, my lord.
78: DON PEDRO: Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.
79: BENEDICK: An he had been a dog that should have howled thus,
80: they would have hanged him: and I pray God his bad
81: voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the
82: night-raven, come what plague could have come after
83: it.
84: DON PEDRO: Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee,
85: get us some excellent music; for to-morrow night we
86: would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.
87: BALTHASAR: The best I can, my lord.
88: DON PEDRO: Do so: farewell.
89: Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of
90: to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with
91: Signior Benedick?
92: CLAUDIO: O, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I did
93: never think that lady would have loved any man.
94: LEONATO: No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she
95: should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in
96: all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.
97: BENEDICK: Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?
98: LEONATO: By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think
99: of it but that she loves him with an enraged
100: affection: it is past the infinite of thought.
101: DON PEDRO: May be she doth but counterfeit.
102: CLAUDIO: Faith, like enough.
103: LEONATO: O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of
104: passion came so near the life of passion as she
105: discovers it.
106: DON PEDRO: Why, what effects of passion shows she?
107: CLAUDIO: Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.
108: LEONATO: What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard
109: my daughter tell you how.
110: CLAUDIO: She did, indeed.
111: DON PEDRO: How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I
112: thought her spirit had been invincible against all
113: assaults of affection.
114: LEONATO: I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially
115: against Benedick.
116: BENEDICK: I should think this a gull, but that the
117: white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,
118: sure, hide himself in such reverence.
119: CLAUDIO: He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.
120: DON PEDRO: Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?
121: LEONATO: No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.
122: CLAUDIO: 'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall
123: I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him
124: with scorn, write to him that I love him?'
125: LEONATO: This says she now when she is beginning to write to
126: him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and
127: there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a
128: sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.
129: CLAUDIO: Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a
130: pretty jest your daughter told us of.
131: LEONATO: O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she
132: found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?
133: CLAUDIO: That.
134: LEONATO: O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;
135: railed at herself, that she should be so immodest
136: to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I
137: measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I
138: should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I
139: love him, I should.'
140: CLAUDIO: Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,
141: beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O
142: sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'
143: LEONATO: She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the
144: ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter
145: is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage
146: to herself: it is very true.
147: DON PEDRO: It were good that Benedick knew of it by some
148: other, if she will not discover it.
149: CLAUDIO: To what end? He would make but a sport of it and
150: torment the poor lady worse.
151: DON PEDRO: An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an
152: excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,
153: she is virtuous.
154: CLAUDIO: And she is exceeding wise.
155: DON PEDRO: In every thing but in loving Benedick.
156: LEONATO: O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender
157: a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath
158: the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just
159: cause, being her uncle and her guardian.
160: DON PEDRO: I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would
161: have daffed all other respects and made her half
162: myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear
163: what a' will say.
164: LEONATO: Were it good, think you?
165: CLAUDIO: Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she
166: will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere
167: she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo
168: her, rather than she will bate one breath of her
169: accustomed crossness.
170: DON PEDRO: She doth well: if she should make tender of her
171: love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the
172: man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.
173: CLAUDIO: He is a very proper man.
174: DON PEDRO: He hath indeed a good outward happiness.
175: CLAUDIO: Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.
176: DON PEDRO: He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.
177: CLAUDIO: And I take him to be valiant.
178: DON PEDRO: As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of
179: quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he
180: avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes
181: them with a most Christian-like fear.
182: LEONATO: If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:
183: if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a
184: quarrel with fear and trembling.
185: DON PEDRO: And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,
186: howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests
187: he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall
188: we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?
189: CLAUDIO: Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with
190: good counsel.
191: LEONATO: Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.
192: DON PEDRO: Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:
193: let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I
194: could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see
195: how much he is unworthy so good a lady.
196: LEONATO: My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.
197: CLAUDIO: If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never
198: trust my expectation.
199: DON PEDRO: Let there be the same net spread for her; and that
200: must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The
201: sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of
202: another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the
203: scene that I would see, which will be merely a
204: dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.
205: BENEDICK: [Coming forward] This can be no trick: the
206: conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of
207: this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it
208: seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!
209: why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:
210: they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive
211: the love come from her; they say too that she will
212: rather die than give any sign of affection. I did
213: never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy
214: are they that hear their detractions and can put
215: them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a
216: truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis
217: so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving
218: me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor
219: no great argument of her folly, for I will be
220: horribly in love with her. I may chance have some
221: odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,
222: because I have railed so long against marriage: but
223: doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat
224: in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.
225: Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
226: the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?
227: No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would
228: die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I
229: were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!
230: she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in
231: her.
232: BEATRICE: Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.
233: BENEDICK: Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.
234: BEATRICE: I took no more pains for those thanks than you take
235: pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would
236: not have come.
237: BENEDICK: You take pleasure then in the message?
238: BEATRICE: Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's
239: point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,
240: signior: fare you well.
ACT 3 SCENE 1

1: HERO: Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;
2: There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
3: Proposing with the prince and Claudio:
4: Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula
5: Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
6: Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;
7: And bid her steal into the pleached bower,
8: Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,
9: Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,
10: Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
11: Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,
12: To listen our purpose. This is thy office;
13: Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.
14: MARGARET: I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.
15: HERO: Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
16: As we do trace this alley up and down,
17: Our talk must only be of Benedick.
18: When I do name him, let it be thy part
19: To praise him more than ever man did merit:
20: My talk to thee must be how Benedick
21: Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter
22: Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,
23: That only wounds by hearsay.
24: Now begin;
25: For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs
26: Close by the ground, to hear our conference.
27: URSULA: The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
28: Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,
29: And greedily devour the treacherous bait:
30: So angle we for Beatrice; who even now
31: Is couched in the woodbine coverture.
32: Fear you not my part of the dialogue.
33: HERO: Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing
34: Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.
35: No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;
36: I know her spirits are as coy and wild
37: As haggerds of the rock.
38: URSULA: But are you sure
39: That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
40: HERO: So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.
41: URSULA: And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?
42: HERO: They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;
43: But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,
44: To wish him wrestle with affection,
45: And never to let Beatrice know of it.
46: URSULA: Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
47: Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
48: As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
49: HERO: O god of love! I know he doth deserve
50: As much as may be yielded to a man:
51: But Nature never framed a woman's heart
52: Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;
53: Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
54: Misprising what they look on, and her wit
55: Values itself so highly that to her
56: All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,
57: Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
58: She is so self-endeared.
59: URSULA: Sure, I think so;
60: And therefore certainly it were not good
61: She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.
62: HERO: Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
63: How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,
64: But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,
65: She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
66: If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,
67: Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
68: If low, an agate very vilely cut;
69: If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
70: If silent, why, a block moved with none.
71: So turns she every man the wrong side out
72: And never gives to truth and virtue that
73: Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
74: URSULA: Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
75: HERO: No, not to be so odd and from all fashions
76: As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:
77: But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
78: She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me
79: Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
80: Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,
81: Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:
82: It were a better death than die with mocks,
83: Which is as bad as die with tickling.
84: URSULA: Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.
85: HERO: No; rather I will go to Benedick
86: And counsel him to fight against his passion.
87: And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders
88: To stain my cousin with: one doth not know
89: How much an ill word may empoison liking.
90: URSULA: O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.
91: She cannot be so much without true judgment--
92: Having so swift and excellent a wit
93: As she is prized to have--as to refuse
94: So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.
95: HERO: He is the only man of Italy.
96: Always excepted my dear Claudio.
97: URSULA: I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,
98: Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,
99: For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,
100: Goes foremost in report through Italy.
101: HERO: Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.
102: URSULA: His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.
103: When are you married, madam?
104: HERO: Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:
105: I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel
106: Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.
107: URSULA: She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.
108: HERO: If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:
109: Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
110: BEATRICE: [Coming forward]
111: What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?
112: Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?
113: Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!
114: No glory lives behind the back of such.
115: And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,
116: Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:
117: If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee
118: To bind our loves up in a holy band;
119: For others say thou dost deserve, and I
120: Believe it better than reportingly.
ACT 3 SCENE 2

1: DON PEDRO: I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and
2: then go I toward Arragon.
3: CLAUDIO: I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll
4: vouchsafe me.
5: DON PEDRO: Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss
6: of your marriage as to show a child his new coat
7: and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold
8: with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown
9: of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all
10: mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's
11: bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at
12: him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his
13: tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his
14: tongue speaks.
15: BENEDICK: Gallants, I am not as I have been.
16: LEONATO: So say I methinks you are sadder.
17: CLAUDIO: I hope he be in love.
18: DON PEDRO: Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in
19: him, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,
20: he wants money.
21: BENEDICK: I have the toothache.
22: DON PEDRO: Draw it.
23: BENEDICK: Hang it!
24: CLAUDIO: You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.
25: DON PEDRO: What! sigh for the toothache?
26: LEONATO: Where is but a humour or a worm.
27: BENEDICK: Well, every one can master a grief but he that has
28: it.
29: CLAUDIO: Yet say I, he is in love.
30: DON PEDRO: There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be
31: a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be
32: a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the
33: shape of two countries at once, as, a German from
34: the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from
35: the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy
36: to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no
37: fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.
38: CLAUDIO: If he be not in love with some woman, there is no
39: believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o'
40: mornings; what should that bode?
41: DON PEDRO: Hath any man seen him at the barber's?
42: CLAUDIO: No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,
43: and the old ornament of his cheek hath already
44: stuffed tennis-balls.
45: LEONATO: Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.
46: DON PEDRO: Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him
47: out by that?
48: CLAUDIO: That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.
49: DON PEDRO: The greatest note of it is his melancholy.
50: CLAUDIO: And when was he wont to wash his face?
51: DON PEDRO: Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear
52: what they say of him.
53: CLAUDIO: Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into
54: a lute-string and now governed by stops.
55: DON PEDRO: Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,
56: conclude he is in love.
57: CLAUDIO: Nay, but I know who loves him.
58: DON PEDRO: That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.
59: CLAUDIO: Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of
60: all, dies for him.
61: DON PEDRO: She shall be buried with her face upwards.
62: BENEDICK: Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old
63: signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight
64: or nine wise words to speak to you, which these
65: hobby-horses must not hear.
66: DON PEDRO: For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.
67: CLAUDIO: 'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this
68: played their parts with Beatrice; and then the two
69: bears will not bite one another when they meet.
70: DON JOHN: My lord and brother, God save you!
71: DON PEDRO: Good den, brother.
72: DON JOHN: If your leisure served, I would speak with you.
73: DON PEDRO: In private?
74: DON JOHN: If it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear; for
75: what I would speak of concerns him.
76: DON PEDRO: What's the matter?
77: DON JOHN: [To CLAUDIO] Means your lordship to be married
78: to-morrow?
79: DON PEDRO: You know he does.
80: DON JOHN: I know not that, when he knows what I know.
81: CLAUDIO: If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.
82: DON JOHN: You may think I love you not: let that appear
83: hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will
84: manifest. For my brother, I think he holds you
85: well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect
86: your ensuing marriage;--surely suit ill spent and
87: labour ill bestowed.
88: DON PEDRO: Why, what's the matter?
89: DON JOHN: I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances
90: shortened, for she has been too long a talking of,
91: the lady is disloyal.
92: CLAUDIO: Who, Hero?
93: DON PEDRO: Even she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero:
94: CLAUDIO: Disloyal?
95: DON JOHN: The word is too good to paint out her wickedness; I
96: could say she were worse: think you of a worse
97: title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till
98: further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall
99: see her chamber-window entered, even the night
100: before her wedding-day: if you love her then,
101: to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour
102: to change your mind.
103: CLAUDIO: May this be so?
104: DON PEDRO: I will not think it.
105: DON JOHN: If you dare not trust that you see, confess not
106: that you know: if you will follow me, I will show
107: you enough; and when you have seen more and heard
108: more, proceed accordingly.
109: CLAUDIO: If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry
110: her to-morrow in the congregation, where I should
111: wed, there will I shame her.
112: DON PEDRO: And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join
113: with thee to disgrace her.
114: DON JOHN: I will disparage her no farther till you are my
115: witnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, and
116: let the issue show itself.
117: DON PEDRO: O day untowardly turned!
118: CLAUDIO: O mischief strangely thwarting!
119: DON JOHN: O plague right well prevented! so will you say when
120: you have seen the sequel.
ACT 3 SCENE 3

1: DOGBERRY: Are you good men and true?
2: VERGES: Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer
3: salvation, body and soul.
4: DOGBERRY: Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if
5: they should have any allegiance in them, being
6: chosen for the prince's watch.
7: VERGES: Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.
8: DOGBERRY: First, who think you the most desertless man to be
9: constable?
10: First Watchman: Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they can
11: write and read.
12: DOGBERRY: Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed
13: you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is
14: the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.
15: Second Watchman: Both which, master constable,--
16: DOGBERRY: You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,
17: for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make
18: no boast of it; and for your writing and reading,
19: let that appear when there is no need of such
20: vanity. You are thought here to be the most
21: senseless and fit man for the constable of the
22: watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your
23: charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are
24: to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.
25: Second Watchman: How if a' will not stand?
26: DOGBERRY: Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and
27: presently call the rest of the watch together and
28: thank God you are rid of a knave.
29: VERGES: If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none
30: of the prince's subjects.
31: DOGBERRY: True, and they are to meddle with none but the
32: prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in
33: the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to
34: talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
35: Watchman: We will rather sleep than talk: we know what
36: belongs to a watch.
37: DOGBERRY: Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet
38: watchman; for I cannot see how sleeping should
39: offend: only, have a care that your bills be not
40: stolen. Well, you are to call at all the
41: ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.
42: Watchman: How if they will not?
43: DOGBERRY: Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if
44: they make you not then the better answer, you may
45: say they are not the men you took them for.
46: Watchman: Well, sir.
47: DOGBERRY: If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue
48: of your office, to be no true man; and, for such
49: kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,
50: why the more is for your honesty.
51: Watchman: If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay
52: hands on him?
53: DOGBERRY: Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they
54: that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable
55: way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him
56: show himself what he is and steal out of your company.
57: VERGES: You have been always called a merciful man, partner.
58: DOGBERRY: Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more
59: a man who hath any honesty in him.
60: VERGES: If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call
61: to the nurse and bid her still it.
62: Watchman: How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?
63: DOGBERRY: Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake
64: her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her
65: lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.
66: VERGES: 'Tis very true.
67: DOGBERRY: This is the end of the charge:--you, constable, are
68: to present the prince's own person: if you meet the
69: prince in the night, you may stay him.
70: VERGES: Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.
71: DOGBERRY: Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knows
72: the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without
73: the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought
74: to offend no man; and it is an offence to stay a
75: man against his will.
76: VERGES: By'r lady, I think it be so.
77: DOGBERRY: Ha, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be
78: any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your
79: fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.
80: Come, neighbour.
81: Watchman: Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here
82: upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.
83: DOGBERRY: One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch
84: about Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding being
85: there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.
86: Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.
87: BORACHIO: What Conrade!
88: Watchman: [Aside] Peace! stir not.
89: BORACHIO: Conrade, I say!
90: CONRADE: Here, man; I am at thy elbow.
91: BORACHIO: Mass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would a
92: scab follow.
93: CONRADE: I will owe thee an answer for that: and now forward
94: with thy tale.
95: BORACHIO: Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house, for
96: it drizzles rain; and I will, like a true drunkard,
97: utter all to thee.
98: Watchman: [Aside] Some treason, masters: yet stand close.
99: BORACHIO: Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.
100: CONRADE: Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?
101: BORACHIO: Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any
102: villany should be so rich; for when rich villains
103: have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what
104: price they will.
105: CONRADE: I wonder at it.
106: BORACHIO: That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that
107: the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is
108: nothing to a man.
109: CONRADE: Yes, it is apparel.
110: BORACHIO: I mean, the fashion.
111: CONRADE: Yes, the fashion is the fashion.
112: BORACHIO: Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But
113: seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion
114: is?
115: Watchman: [Aside] I know that Deformed; a' has been a vile
116: thief this seven year; a' goes up and down like a
117: gentleman: I remember his name.
118: BORACHIO: Didst thou not hear somebody?
119: CONRADE: No; 'twas the vane on the house.
120: BORACHIO: Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this
121: fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot
122: bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?
123: sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers
124: in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's
125: priests in the old church-window, sometime like the
126: shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,
127: where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?
128: CONRADE: All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears
129: out more apparel than the man. But art not thou
130: thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast
131: shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
132: BORACHIO: Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night
133: wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the
134: name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'
135: chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good
136: night,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should first
137: tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,
138: planted and placed and possessed by my master Don
139: John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.
140: CONRADE: And thought they Margaret was Hero?
141: BORACHIO: Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the
142: devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly
143: by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by
144: the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly
145: by my villany, which did confirm any slander that
146: Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore
147: he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning
148: at the temple, and there, before the whole
149: congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night
150: and send her home again without a husband.
151: First Watchman: We charge you, in the prince's name, stand!
152: Second Watchman: Call up the right master constable. We have here
153: recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that
154: ever was known in the commonwealth.
155: First Watchman: And one Deformed is one of them: I know him; a'
156: wears a lock.
157: CONRADE: Masters, masters,--
158: Second Watchman: You'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.
159: CONRADE: Masters,--
160: First Watchman: Never speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.
161: BORACHIO: We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken
162: up of these men's bills.
163: CONRADE: A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we'll obey you.
ACT 3 SCENE 4

1: HERO: Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice, and desire
2: her to rise.
3: URSULA: I will, lady.
4: HERO: And bid her come hither.
5: URSULA: Well.
6: MARGARET: Troth, I think your other rabato were better.
7: HERO: No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this.
8: MARGARET: By my troth, 's not so good; and I warrant your
9: cousin will say so.
10: HERO: My cousin's a fool, and thou art another: I'll wear
11: none but this.
12: MARGARET: I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair
13: were a thought browner; and your gown's a most rare
14: fashion, i' faith. I saw the Duchess of Milan's
15: gown that they praise so.
16: HERO: O, that exceeds, they say.
17: MARGARET: By my troth, 's but a night-gown in respect of
18: yours: cloth o' gold, and cuts, and laced with
19: silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves,
20: and skirts, round underborne with a bluish tinsel:
21: but for a fine, quaint, graceful and excellent
22: fashion, yours is worth ten on 't.
23: HERO: God give me joy to wear it! for my heart is
24: exceeding heavy.
25: MARGARET: 'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.
26: HERO: Fie upon thee! art not ashamed?
27: MARGARET: Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is not
28: marriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lord
29: honourable without marriage? I think you would have
30: me say, 'saving your reverence, a husband:' and bad
31: thinking do not wrest true speaking, I'll offend
32: nobody: is there any harm in 'the heavier for a
33: husband'? None, I think, and it be the right husband
34: and the right wife; otherwise 'tis light, and not
35: heavy: ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes.
36: HERO: Good morrow, coz.
37: BEATRICE: Good morrow, sweet Hero.
38: HERO: Why how now? do you speak in the sick tune?
39: BEATRICE: I am out of all other tune, methinks.
40: MARGARET: Clap's into 'Light o' love;' that goes without a
41: burden: do you sing it, and I'll dance it.
42: BEATRICE: Ye light o' love, with your heels! then, if your
43: husband have stables enough, you'll see he shall
44: lack no barns.
45: MARGARET: O illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels.
46: BEATRICE: 'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin; tis time you were
47: ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill: heigh-ho!
48: MARGARET: For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?
49: BEATRICE: For the letter that begins them all, H.
50: MARGARET: Well, and you be not turned Turk, there's no more
51: sailing by the star.
52: BEATRICE: What means the fool, trow?
53: MARGARET: Nothing I; but God send every one their heart's desire!
54: HERO: These gloves the count sent me; they are an
55: excellent perfume.
56: BEATRICE: I am stuffed, cousin; I cannot smell.
57: MARGARET: A maid, and stuffed! there's goodly catching of cold.
58: BEATRICE: O, God help me! God help me! how long have you
59: professed apprehension?
60: MARGARET: Even since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely?
61: BEATRICE: It is not seen enough, you should wear it in your
62: cap. By my troth, I am sick.
63: MARGARET: Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus,
64: and lay it to your heart: it is the only thing for a qualm.
65: HERO: There thou prickest her with a thistle.
66: BEATRICE: Benedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral in
67: this Benedictus.
68: MARGARET: Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I
69: meant, plain holy-thistle. You may think perchance
70: that I think you are in love: nay, by'r lady, I am
71: not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list
72: not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think,
73: if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you
74: are in love or that you will be in love or that you
75: can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and
76: now is he become a man: he swore he would never
77: marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats
78: his meat without grudging: and how you may be
79: converted I know not, but methinks you look with
80: your eyes as other women do.
81: BEATRICE: What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?
82: MARGARET: Not a false gallop.
83: URSULA: Madam, withdraw: the prince, the count, Signior
84: Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the
85: town, are come to fetch you to church.
86: HERO: Help to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula.
ACT 3 SCENE 5

1: LEONATO: What would you with me, honest neighbour?
2: DOGBERRY: Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you
3: that decerns you nearly.
4: LEONATO: Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.
5: DOGBERRY: Marry, this it is, sir.
6: VERGES: Yes, in truth it is, sir.
7: LEONATO: What is it, my good friends?
8: DOGBERRY: Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the
9: matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so
10: blunt as, God help, I would desire they were; but,
11: in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.
12: VERGES: Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living
13: that is an old man and no honester than I.
14: DOGBERRY: Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.
15: LEONATO: Neighbours, you are tedious.
16: DOGBERRY: It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the
17: poor duke's officers; but truly, for mine own part,
18: if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in
19: my heart to bestow it all of your worship.
20: LEONATO: All thy tediousness on me, ah?
21: DOGBERRY: Yea, an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis; for
22: I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any
23: man in the city; and though I be but a poor man, I
24: am glad to hear it.
25: VERGES: And so am I.
26: LEONATO: I would fain know what you have to say.
27: VERGES: Marry, sir, our watch to-night, excepting your
28: worship's presence, ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant
29: knaves as any in Messina.
30: DOGBERRY: A good old man, sir; he will be talking: as they
31: say, when the age is in, the wit is out: God help
32: us! it is a world to see. Well said, i' faith,
33: neighbour Verges: well, God's a good man; an two men
34: ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest
35: soul, i' faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever
36: broke bread; but God is to be worshipped; all men
37: are not alike; alas, good neighbour!
38: LEONATO: Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.
39: DOGBERRY: Gifts that God gives.
40: LEONATO: I must leave you.
41: DOGBERRY: One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed
42: comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would
43: have them this morning examined before your worship.
44: LEONATO: Take their examination yourself and bring it me: I
45: am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.
46: DOGBERRY: It shall be suffigance.
47: LEONATO: Drink some wine ere you go: fare you well.
48: Messenger: My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to
49: her husband.
50: LEONATO: I'll wait upon them: I am ready.
51: DOGBERRY: Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole;
52: bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we
53: are now to examination these men.
54: VERGES: And we must do it wisely.
ACT 4 SCENE 1

1: LEONATO: Come, Friar Francis, be brief; only to the plain
2: form of marriage, and you shall recount their
3: particular duties afterwards.
4: FRIAR FRANCIS: You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.
5: CLAUDIO: No.
6: LEONATO: To be married to her: friar, you come to marry her.
7: FRIAR FRANCIS: Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.
8: HERO: I do.
9: FRIAR FRANCIS: If either of you know any inward impediment why you
10: should not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,
11: to utter it.
12: CLAUDIO: Know you any, Hero?
13: HERO: None, my lord.
14: FRIAR FRANCIS: Know you any, count?
15: LEONATO: I dare make his answer, none.
16: CLAUDIO: O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily
17: do, not knowing what they do!
18: BENEDICK: How now! interjections? Why, then, some be of
19: laughing, as, ah, ha, he!
20: CLAUDIO: Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:
21: Will you with free and unconstrained soul
22: Give me this maid, your daughter?
23: LEONATO: As freely, son, as God did give her me.
24: CLAUDIO: And what have I to give you back, whose worth
25: May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
26: DON PEDRO: Nothing, unless you render her again.
27: CLAUDIO: Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.
28: There, Leonato, take her back again:
29: Give not this rotten orange to your friend;
30: She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.
31: Behold how like a maid she blushes here!
32: O, what authority and show of truth
33: Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
34: Comes not that blood as modest evidence
35: To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,
36: All you that see her, that she were a maid,
37: By these exterior shows? But she is none:
38: She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;
39: Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.
40: LEONATO: What do you mean, my lord?
41: CLAUDIO: Not to be married,
42: Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.
43: LEONATO: Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,
44: Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
45: And made defeat of her virginity,--
46: CLAUDIO: I know what you would say: if I have known her,
47: You will say she did embrace me as a husband,
48: And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:
49: No, Leonato,
50: I never tempted her with word too large;
51: But, as a brother to his sister, show'd
52: Bashful sincerity and comely love.
53: HERO: And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?
54: CLAUDIO: Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:
55: You seem to me as Dian in her orb,
56: As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;
57: But you are more intemperate in your blood
58: Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals
59: That rage in savage sensuality.
60: HERO: Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?
61: LEONATO: Sweet prince, why speak not you?
62: DON PEDRO: What should I speak?
63: I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about
64: To link my dear friend to a common stale.
65: LEONATO: Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?
66: DON JOHN: Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.
67: BENEDICK: This looks not like a nuptial.
68: HERO: True! O God!
69: CLAUDIO: Leonato, stand I here?
70: Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?
71: Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?
72: LEONATO: All this is so: but what of this, my lord?
73: CLAUDIO: Let me but move one question to your daughter;
74: And, by that fatherly and kindly power
75: That you have in her, bid her answer truly.
76: LEONATO: I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.
77: HERO: O, God defend me! how am I beset!
78: What kind of catechising call you this?
79: CLAUDIO: To make you answer truly to your name.
80: HERO: Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name
81: With any just reproach?
82: CLAUDIO: Marry, that can Hero;
83: Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.
84: What man was he talk'd with you yesternight
85: Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?
86: Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.
87: HERO: I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.
88: DON PEDRO: Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,
89: I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,
90: Myself, my brother and this grieved count
91: Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night
92: Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window
93: Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,
94: Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
95: A thousand times in secret.
96: DON JOHN: Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,
97: Not to be spoke of;
98: There is not chastity enough in language
99: Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,
100: I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.
101: CLAUDIO: O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,
102: If half thy outward graces had been placed
103: About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!
104: But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,
105: Thou pure impiety and impious purity!
106: For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,
107: And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,
108: To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,
109: And never shall it more be gracious.
110: LEONATO: Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?
111: BEATRICE: Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?
112: DON JOHN: Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light,
113: Smother her spirits up.
114: BENEDICK: How doth the lady?
115: BEATRICE: Dead, I think. Help, uncle!
116: Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!
117: LEONATO: O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.
118: Death is the fairest cover for her shame
119: That may be wish'd for.
120: BEATRICE: How now, cousin Hero!
121: FRIAR FRANCIS: Have comfort, lady.
122: LEONATO: Dost thou look up?
123: FRIAR FRANCIS: Yea, wherefore should she not?
124: LEONATO: Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing
125: Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny
126: The story that is printed in her blood?
127: Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:
128: For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,
129: Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,
130: Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,
131: Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?
132: Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?
133: O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?
134: Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?
135: Why had I not with charitable hand
136: Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,
137: Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,
138: I might have said 'No part of it is mine;
139: This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?
140: But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised
141: And mine that I was proud on, mine so much
142: That I myself was to myself not mine,
143: Valuing of her,--why, she, O, she is fallen
144: Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea
145: Hath drops too few to wash her clean again
146: And salt too little which may season give
147: To her foul-tainted flesh!
148: BENEDICK: Sir, sir, be patient.
149: For my part, I am so attired in wonder,
150: I know not what to say.
151: BEATRICE: O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!
152: BENEDICK: Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?
153: BEATRICE: No, truly not; although, until last night,
154: I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.
155: LEONATO: Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made
156: Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!
157: Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,
158: Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,
159: Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.
160: FRIAR FRANCIS: Hear me a little;
161: For I have only been silent so long
162: And given way unto this course of fortune.
163: ...
164: By noting of the lady I have mark'd
165: A thousand blushing apparitions
166: To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames
167: In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;
168: And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,
169: To burn the errors that these princes hold
170: Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;
171: Trust not my reading nor my observations,
172: Which with experimental seal doth warrant
173: The tenor of my book; trust not my age,
174: My reverence, calling, nor divinity,
175: If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
176: Under some biting error.
177: LEONATO: Friar, it cannot be.
178: Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
179: Is that she will not add to her damnation
180: A sin of perjury; she not denies it:
181: Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
182: That which appears in proper nakedness?
183: FRIAR FRANCIS: Lady, what man is he you are accused of?
184: HERO: They know that do accuse me; I know none:
185: If I know more of any man alive
186: Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,
187: Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,
188: Prove you that any man with me conversed
189: At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight
190: Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,
191: Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!
192: FRIAR FRANCIS: There is some strange misprision in the princes.
193: BENEDICK: Two of them have the very bent of honour;
194: And if their wisdoms be misled in this,
195: The practise of it lives in John the bastard,
196: Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.
197: LEONATO: I know not. If they speak but truth of her,
198: These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,
199: The proudest of them shall well hear of it.
200: Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,
201: Nor age so eat up my invention,
202: Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,
203: Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
204: But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,
205: Both strength of limb and policy of mind,
206: Ability in means and choice of friends,
207: To quit me of them throughly.
208: FRIAR FRANCIS: Pause awhile,
209: And let my counsel sway you in this case.
210: Your daughter here the princes left for dead:
211: Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
212: And publish it that she is dead indeed;
213: Maintain a mourning ostentation
214: And on your family's old monument
215: Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
216: That appertain unto a burial.
217: LEONATO: What shall become of this? what will this do?
218: FRIAR FRANCIS: Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf
219: Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
220: But not for that dream I on this strange course,
221: But on this travail look for greater birth.
222: She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,
223: Upon the instant that she was accused,
224: Shall be lamented, pitied and excused
225: Of every hearer: for it so falls out
226: That what we have we prize not to the worth
227: Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,
228: Why, then we rack the value, then we find
229: The virtue that possession would not show us
230: Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:
231: When he shall hear she died upon his words,
232: The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
233: Into his study of imagination,
234: And every lovely organ of her life
235: Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
236: More moving-delicate and full of life,
237: Into the eye and prospect of his soul,
238: Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,
239: If ever love had interest in his liver,
240: And wish he had not so accused her,
241: No, though he thought his accusation true.
242: Let this be so, and doubt not but success
243: Will fashion the event in better shape
244: Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
245: But if all aim but this be levell'd false,
246: The supposition of the lady's death
247: Will quench the wonder of her infamy:
248: And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
249: As best befits her wounded reputation,
250: In some reclusive and religious life,
251: Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.
252: BENEDICK: Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:
253: And though you know my inwardness and love
254: Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,
255: Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this
256: As secretly and justly as your soul
257: Should with your body.
258: LEONATO: Being that I flow in grief,
259: The smallest twine may lead me.
260: FRIAR FRANCIS: 'Tis well consented: presently away;
261: For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.
262: Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day
263: Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.
264: BENEDICK: Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?
265: BEATRICE: Yea, and I will weep a while longer.
266: BENEDICK: I will not desire that.
267: BEATRICE: You have no reason; I do it freely.
268: BENEDICK: Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.
269: BEATRICE: Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!
270: BENEDICK: Is there any way to show such friendship?
271: BEATRICE: A very even way, but no such friend.
272: BENEDICK: May a man do it?
273: BEATRICE: It is a man's office, but not yours.
274: BENEDICK: I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is
275: not that strange?
276: BEATRICE: As strange as the thing I know not. It were as
277: possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as
278: you: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; I
279: confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.
280: BENEDICK: By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.
281: BEATRICE: Do not swear, and eat it.
282: BENEDICK: I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make
283: him eat it that says I love not you.
284: BEATRICE: Will you not eat your word?
285: BENEDICK: With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest
286: I love thee.
287: BEATRICE: Why, then, God forgive me!
288: BENEDICK: What offence, sweet Beatrice?
289: BEATRICE: You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to
290: protest I loved you.
291: BENEDICK: And do it with all thy heart.
292: BEATRICE: I love you with so much of my heart that none is
293: left to protest.
294: BENEDICK: Come, bid me do any thing for thee.
295: BEATRICE: Kill Claudio.
296: BENEDICK: Ha! not for the wide world.
297: BEATRICE: You kill me to deny it. Farewell.
298: BENEDICK: Tarry, sweet Beatrice.
299: BEATRICE: I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in
300: you: nay, I pray you, let me go.
301: BENEDICK: Beatrice,--
302: BEATRICE: In faith, I will go.
303: BENEDICK: We'll be friends first.
304: BEATRICE: You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.
305: BENEDICK: Is Claudio thine enemy?
306: BEATRICE: Is he not approved in the height a villain, that
307: hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O
308: that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they
309: come to take hands; and then, with public
310: accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,
311: --O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart
312: in the market-place.
313: BENEDICK: Hear me, Beatrice,--
314: BEATRICE: Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!
315: BENEDICK: Nay, but, Beatrice,--
316: BEATRICE: Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.
317: BENEDICK: Beat--
318: BEATRICE: Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,
319: a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,
320: surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I
321: had any friend would be a man for my sake! But
322: manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into
323: compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and
324: trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules
325: that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a
326: man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.
327: BENEDICK: Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.
328: BEATRICE: Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.
329: BENEDICK: Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?
330: BEATRICE: Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.
331: BENEDICK: Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I will
332: kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,
333: Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you
334: hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your
335: cousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.
ACT 4 SCENE 2

1: DOGBERRY: Is our whole dissembly appeared?
2: VERGES: O, a stool and a cushion for the sexton.
3: Sexton: Which be the malefactors?
4: DOGBERRY: Marry, that am I and my partner.
5: VERGES: Nay, that's certain; we have the exhibition to examine.
6: Sexton: But which are the offenders that are to be
7: examined? let them come before master constable.
8: DOGBERRY: Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your
9: name, friend?
10: BORACHIO: Borachio.
11: DOGBERRY: Pray, write down, Borachio. Yours, sirrah?
12: CONRADE: I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.
13: DOGBERRY: Write down, master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do
14: you serve God?
15: BORACHIO: Yea, sir, we hope.
16: DOGBERRY: Write down, that they hope they serve God: and
17: write God first; for God defend but God should go
18: before such villains! Masters, it is proved already
19: that you are little better than false knaves; and it
20: will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer
21: you for yourselves?
22: CONRADE: Marry, sir, we say we are none.
23: DOGBERRY: A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you: but I
24: will go about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a
25: word in your ear: sir, I say to you, it is thought
26: you are false knaves.
27: BORACHIO: Sir, I say to you we are none.
28: DOGBERRY: Well, stand aside. 'Fore God, they are both in a
29: tale. Have you writ down, that they are none?
30: Sexton: Master constable, you go not the way to examine:
31: you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.
32: DOGBERRY: Yea, marry, that's the eftest way. Let the watch
33: come forth. Masters, I charge you, in the prince's
34: name, accuse these men.
35: First Watchman: This man said, sir, that Don John, the prince's
36: brother, was a villain.
37: DOGBERRY: Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat
38: perjury, to call a prince's brother villain.
39: BORACHIO: Master constable,--
40: DOGBERRY: Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look,
41: I promise thee.
42: Sexton: What heard you him say else?
43: Second Watchman: Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of
44: Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.
45: DOGBERRY: Flat burglary as ever was committed.
46: VERGES: Yea, by mass, that it is.
47: Sexton: What else, fellow?
48: First Watchman: And that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words, to
49: disgrace Hero before the whole assembly. and not marry her.
50: DOGBERRY: O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting
51: redemption for this.
52: Sexton: What else?
53: Watchman: This is all.
54: Sexton: And this is more, masters, than you can deny.
55: Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away;
56: Hero was in this manner accused, in this very manner
57: refused, and upon the grief of this suddenly died.
58: Master constable, let these men be bound, and
59: brought to Leonato's: I will go before and show
60: him their examination.
61: DOGBERRY: Come, let them be opinioned.
62: VERGES: Let them be in the hands--
63: CONRADE: Off, coxcomb!
64: DOGBERRY: God's my life, where's the sexton? let him write
65: down the prince's officer coxcomb. Come, bind them.
66: Thou naughty varlet!
67: CONRADE: Away! you are an ass, you are an ass.
ACT 5 SCENE 1

1: ANTONIO: If you go on thus, you will kill yourself:
2: And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief
3: Against yourself.
4: LEONATO: I pray thee, cease thy counsel,
5: Which falls into mine ears as profitless
6: As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;
7: Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
8: But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.
9: Bring me a father that so loved his child,
10: Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,
11: And bid him speak of patience;
12: Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
13: And let it answer every strain for strain,
14: As thus for thus and such a grief for such,
15: In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:
16: If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
17: Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,
18: Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk
19: With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,
20: And I of him will gather patience.
21: But there is no such man: for, brother, men
22: Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
23: Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,
24: Their counsel turns to passion, which before
25: Would give preceptial medicine to rage,
26: Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,
27: Charm ache with air and agony with words:
28: No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience
29: To those that wring under the load of sorrow,
30: But no man's virtue nor sufficiency
31: To be so moral when he shall endure
32: The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:
33: My griefs cry louder than advertisement.
34: ANTONIO: Therein do men from children nothing differ.
35: LEONATO: I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood;
36: For there was never yet philosopher
37: That could endure the toothache patiently,
38: However they have writ the style of gods
39: And made a push at chance and sufferance.
40: ANTONIO: Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;
41: Make those that do offend you suffer too.
42: LEONATO: There thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so.
43: My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;
44: And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince
45: And all of them that thus dishonour her.
46: ANTONIO: Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.
47: DON PEDRO: Good den, good den.
48: CLAUDIO: Good day to both of you.
49: LEONATO: Hear you. my lords,--
50: DON PEDRO: We have some haste, Leonato.
51: LEONATO: Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord:
52: Are you so hasty now? well, all is one.
53: DON PEDRO: Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.
54: ANTONIO: If he could right himself with quarreling,
55: Some of us would lie low.
56: CLAUDIO: Who wrongs him?
57: LEONATO: Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou:--
58: Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;
59: I fear thee not.
60: CLAUDIO: Marry, beshrew my hand,
61: If it should give your age such cause of fear:
62: In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.
63: LEONATO: Tush, tush, man; never fleer and jest at me:
64: I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,
65: As under privilege of age to brag
66: What I have done being young, or what would do
67: Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,
68: Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me
69: That I am forced to lay my reverence by
70: And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,
71: Do challenge thee to trial of a man.
72: I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;
73: Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,
74: And she lies buried with her ancestors;
75: O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,
76: Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!
77: CLAUDIO: My villany?
78: LEONATO: Thine, Claudio; thine, I say.
79: DON PEDRO: You say not right, old man.
80: LEONATO: My lord, my lord,
81: I'll prove it on his body, if he dare,
82: Despite his nice fence and his active practise,
83: His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.
84: CLAUDIO: Away! I will not have to do with you.
85: LEONATO: Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:
86: If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.
87: ANTONIO: He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:
88: But that's no matter; let him kill one first;
89: Win me and wear me; let him answer me.
90: Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me:
91: Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;
92: Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.
93: LEONATO: Brother,--
94: ANTONIO: Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;
95: And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,
96: That dare as well answer a man indeed
97: As I dare take a serpent by the tongue:
98: Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!
99: LEONATO: Brother Antony,--
100: ANTONIO: Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,
101: And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,--
102: Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,
103: That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,
104: Go anticly, show outward hideousness,
105: And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,
106: How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;
107: And this is all.
108: LEONATO: But, brother Antony,--
109: ANTONIO: Come, 'tis no matter:
110: Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.
111: DON PEDRO: Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.
112: My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:
113: But, on my honour, she was charged with nothing
114: But what was true and very full of proof.
115: LEONATO: My lord, my lord,--
116: DON PEDRO: I will not hear you.
117: LEONATO: No? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.
118: ANTONIO: And shall, or some of us will smart for it.
119: DON PEDRO: See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.
120: CLAUDIO: Now, signior, what news?
121: BENEDICK: Good day, my lord.
122: DON PEDRO: Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part
123: almost a fray.
124: CLAUDIO: We had like to have had our two noses snapped off
125: with two old men without teeth.
126: DON PEDRO: Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Had
127: we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.
128: BENEDICK: In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came
129: to seek you both.
130: CLAUDIO: We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are
131: high-proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten
132: away. Wilt thou use thy wit?
133: BENEDICK: It is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?
134: DON PEDRO: Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?
135: CLAUDIO: Never any did so, though very many have been beside
136: their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the
137: minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.
138: DON PEDRO: As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou
139: sick, or angry?
140: CLAUDIO: What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat,
141: thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.
142: BENEDICK: Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you
143: charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.
144: CLAUDIO: Nay, then, give him another staff: this last was
145: broke cross.
146: DON PEDRO: By this light, he changes more and more: I think
147: he be angry indeed.
148: CLAUDIO: If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.
149: BENEDICK: Shall I speak a word in your ear?
150: CLAUDIO: God bless me from a challenge!
151: BENEDICK: [Aside to CLAUDIO] You are a villain; I jest not:
152: I will make it good how you dare, with what you
153: dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will
154: protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet
155: lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me
156: hear from you.
157: CLAUDIO: Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.
158: DON PEDRO: What, a feast, a feast?
159: CLAUDIO: I' faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf's
160: head and a capon; the which if I do not carve most
161: curiously, say my knife's naught. Shall I not find
162: a woodcock too?
163: BENEDICK: Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.
164: DON PEDRO: I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the
165: other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,'
166: said she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'a
167: great wit:' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.'
168: 'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit:' 'Just,' said she, 'it
169: hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman
170: is wise:' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.'
171: 'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues:' 'That I
172: believe,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on
173: Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning;
174: there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus
175: did she, an hour together, transshape thy particular
176: virtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou
177: wast the properest man in Italy.
178: CLAUDIO: For the which she wept heartily and said she cared
179: not.
180: DON PEDRO: Yea, that she did: but yet, for all that, an if she
181: did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly:
182: the old man's daughter told us all.
183: CLAUDIO: All, all; and, moreover, God saw him when he was
184: hid in the garden.
185: DON PEDRO: But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on
186: the sensible Benedick's head?
187: CLAUDIO: Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick the
188: married man'?
189: BENEDICK: Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave
190: you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests
191: as braggarts do their blades, which God be thanked,
192: hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank
193: you: I must discontinue your company: your brother
194: the bastard is fled from Messina: you have among
195: you killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord
196: Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet: and, till
197: then, peace be with him.
198: DON PEDRO: He is in earnest.
199: CLAUDIO: In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for
200: the love of Beatrice.
201: DON PEDRO: And hath challenged thee.
202: CLAUDIO: Most sincerely.
203: DON PEDRO: What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his
204: doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!
205: CLAUDIO: He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a
206: doctor to such a man.
207: DON PEDRO: But, soft you, let me be: pluck up, my heart, and
208: be sad. Did he not say, my brother was fled?
209: DOGBERRY: Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she
210: shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance: nay,
211: an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.
212: DON PEDRO: How now? two of my brother's men bound! Borachio
213: one!
214: CLAUDIO: Hearken after their offence, my lord.
215: DON PEDRO: Officers, what offence have these men done?
216: DOGBERRY: Marry, sir, they have committed false report;
217: moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily,
218: they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have
219: belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust
220: things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.
221: DON PEDRO: First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I
222: ask thee what's their offence; sixth and lastly, why
223: they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay
224: to their charge.
225: CLAUDIO: Rightly reasoned, and in his own division: and, by
226: my troth, there's one meaning well suited.
227: DON PEDRO: Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus
228: bound to your answer? this learned constable is
229: too cunning to be understood: what's your offence?
230: BORACHIO: Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine answer:
231: do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have
232: deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms
233: could not discover, these shallow fools have brought
234: to light: who in the night overheard me confessing
235: to this man how Don John your brother incensed me
236: to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into
237: the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's
238: garments, how you disgraced her, when you should
239: marry her: my villany they have upon record; which
240: I had rather seal with my death than repeat over
241: to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my
242: master's false accusation; and, briefly, I desire
243: nothing but the reward of a villain.
244: DON PEDRO: Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
245: CLAUDIO: I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.
246: DON PEDRO: But did my brother set thee on to this?
247: BORACHIO: Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it.
248: DON PEDRO: He is composed and framed of treachery:
249: And fled he is upon this villany.
250: CLAUDIO: Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear
251: In the rare semblance that I loved it first.
252: DOGBERRY: Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our
253: sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter:
254: and, masters, do not forget to specify, when time
255: and place shall serve, that I am an ass.
256: VERGES: Here, here comes master Signior Leonato, and the
257: Sexton too.
258: LEONATO: Which is the villain? let me see his eyes,
259: That, when I note another man like him,
260: I may avoid him: which of these is he?
261: BORACHIO: If you would know your wronger, look on me.
262: LEONATO: Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd
263: Mine innocent child?
264: BORACHIO: Yea, even I alone.
265: LEONATO: No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:
266: Here stand a pair of honourable men;
267: A third is fled, that had a hand in it.
268: I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death:
269: Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
270: 'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.
271: CLAUDIO: I know not how to pray your patience;
272: Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;
273: Impose me to what penance your invention
274: Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn'd I not
275: But in mistaking.
276: DON PEDRO: By my soul, nor I:
277: And yet, to satisfy this good old man,
278: I would bend under any heavy weight
279: That he'll enjoin me to.
280: LEONATO: I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;
281: That were impossible: but, I pray you both,
282: Possess the people in Messina here
283: How innocent she died; and if your love
284: Can labour ought in sad invention,
285: Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb
286: And sing it to her bones, sing it to-night:
287: To-morrow morning come you to my house,
288: And since you could not be my son-in-law,
289: Be yet my nephew: my brother hath a daughter,
290: Almost the copy of my child that's dead,
291: And she alone is heir to both of us:
292: Give her the right you should have given her cousin,
293: And so dies my revenge.
294: CLAUDIO: O noble sir,
295: Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!
296: I do embrace your offer; and dispose
297: For henceforth of poor Claudio.
298: LEONATO: To-morrow then I will expect your coming;
299: To-night I take my leave. This naughty man
300: Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,
301: Who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong,
302: Hired to it by your brother.
303: BORACHIO: No, by my soul, she was not,
304: Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,
305: But always hath been just and virtuous
306: In any thing that I do know by her.
307: DOGBERRY: Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and
308: black, this plaintiff here, the offender, did call
309: me ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in his
310: punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of
311: one Deformed: they say be wears a key in his ear and
312: a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God's
313: name, the which he hath used so long and never paid
314: that now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothing
315: for God's sake: pray you, examine him upon that point.
316: LEONATO: I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.
317: DOGBERRY: Your worship speaks like a most thankful and
318: reverend youth; and I praise God for you.
319: LEONATO: There's for thy pains.
320: DOGBERRY: God save the foundation!
321: LEONATO: Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.
322: DOGBERRY: I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I
323: beseech your worship to correct yourself, for the
324: example of others. God keep your worship! I wish
325: your worship well; God restore you to health! I
326: humbly give you leave to depart; and if a merry
327: meeting may be wished, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour.
328: LEONATO: Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.
329: ANTONIO: Farewell, my lords: we look for you to-morrow.
330: DON PEDRO: We will not fail.
331: CLAUDIO: To-night I'll mourn with Hero.
332: LEONATO: [To the Watch] Bring you these fellows on. We'll
333: talk with Margaret,
334: How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.
ACT 5 SCENE 2

1: BENEDICK: Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at
2: my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.
3: MARGARET: Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?
4: BENEDICK: In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living
5: shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou
6: deservest it.
7: MARGARET: To have no man come over me! why, shall I always
8: keep below stairs?
9: BENEDICK: Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches.
10: MARGARET: And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit,
11: but hurt not.
12: BENEDICK: A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a
13: woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice: I give
14: thee the bucklers.
15: MARGARET: Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.
16: BENEDICK: If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the
17: pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.
18: MARGARET: Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.
19: BENEDICK: And therefore will come.
20: The god of love,
21: That sits above,
22: And knows me, and knows me,
23: How pitiful I deserve,--
24: I mean in singing; but in loving, Leander the good
25: swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and
26: a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers,
27: whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a
28: blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned
29: over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I
30: cannot show it in rhyme; I have tried: I can find
31: out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent
32: rhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme; for,
33: 'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme; very ominous
34: endings: no, I was not born under a rhyming planet,
35: nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
36: Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?
37: BEATRICE: Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.
38: BENEDICK: O, stay but till then!
39: BEATRICE: 'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere
40: I go, let me go with that I came; which is, with
41: knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.
42: BENEDICK: Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.
43: BEATRICE: Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but
44: foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I
45: will depart unkissed.
46: BENEDICK: Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense,
47: so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee
48: plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge; and either
49: I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe
50: him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me for
51: which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?
52: BEATRICE: For them all together; which maintained so politic
53: a state of evil that they will not admit any good
54: part to intermingle with them. But for which of my
55: good parts did you first suffer love for me?
56: BENEDICK: Suffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer love
57: indeed, for I love thee against my will.
58: BEATRICE: In spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart!
59: If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for
60: yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.
61: BENEDICK: Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.
62: BEATRICE: It appears not in this confession: there's not one
63: wise man among twenty that will praise himself.
64: BENEDICK: An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in
65: the lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erect
66: in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live
67: no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
68: widow weeps.
69: BEATRICE: And how long is that, think you?
70: BENEDICK: Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in
71: rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the
72: wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no
73: impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his
74: own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for
75: praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is
76: praiseworthy: and now tell me, how doth your cousin?
77: BEATRICE: Very ill.
78: BENEDICK: And how do you?
79: BEATRICE: Very ill too.
80: BENEDICK: Serve God, love me and mend. There will I leave
81: you too, for here comes one in haste.
82: URSULA: Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old
83: coil at home: it is proved my Lady Hero hath been
84: falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily
85: abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is
86: fed and gone. Will you come presently?
87: BEATRICE: Will you go hear this news, signior?
88: BENEDICK: I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be
89: buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with
90: thee to thy uncle's.
ACT 5 SCENE 3

1: CLAUDIO: Is this the monument of Leonato?
2: Lord: It is, my lord.
3: CLAUDIO: [Reading out of a scroll]
4: Done to death by slanderous tongues
5: Was the Hero that here lies:
6: Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,
7: Gives her fame which never dies.
8: So the life that died with shame
9: Lives in death with glorious fame.
10: Hang thou there upon the tomb,
11: Praising her when I am dumb.
12: Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
13: SONG.
14: Pardon, goddess of the night,
15: Those that slew thy virgin knight;
16: For the which, with songs of woe,
17: Round about her tomb they go.
18: Midnight, assist our moan;
19: Help us to sigh and groan,
20: Heavily, heavily:
21: Graves, yawn and yield your dead,
22: Till death be uttered,
23: Heavily, heavily.
24: Now, unto thy bones good night!
25: Yearly will I do this rite.
26: DON PEDRO: Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:
27: The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,
28: Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about
29: Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
30: Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.
31: CLAUDIO: Good morrow, masters: each his several way.
32: DON PEDRO: Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;
33: And then to Leonato's we will go.
34: CLAUDIO: And Hymen now with luckier issue speed's
35: Than this for whom we render'd up this woe.
ACT 5 SCENE 4

1: FRIAR FRANCIS: Did I not tell you she was innocent?
2: LEONATO: So are the prince and Claudio, who accused her
3: Upon the error that you heard debated:
4: But Margaret was in some fault for this,
5: Although against her will, as it appears
6: In the true course of all the question.
7: ANTONIO: Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.
8: BENEDICK: And so am I, being else by faith enforced
9: To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.
10: LEONATO: Well, daughter, and you gentle-women all,
11: Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,
12: And when I send for you, come hither mask'd.
13: The prince and Claudio promised by this hour
14: To visit me. You know your office, brother:
15: You must be father to your brother's daughter
16: And give her to young Claudio.
17: ANTONIO: Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.
18: BENEDICK: Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.
19: FRIAR FRANCIS: To do what, signior?
20: BENEDICK: To bind me, or undo me; one of them.
21: Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,
22: Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.
23: LEONATO: That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.
24: BENEDICK: And I do with an eye of love requite her.
25: LEONATO: The sight whereof I think you had from me,
26: From Claudio and the prince: but what's your will?
27: BENEDICK: Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:
28: But, for my will, my will is your good will
29: May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd
30: In the state of honourable marriage:
31: In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.
32: LEONATO: My heart is with your liking.
33: FRIAR FRANCIS: And my help.
34: Here comes the prince and Claudio.
35: DON PEDRO: Good morrow to this fair assembly.
36: LEONATO: Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio:
37: We here attend you. Are you yet determined
38: To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?
39: CLAUDIO: I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.
40: LEONATO: Call her forth, brother; here's the friar ready.
41: DON PEDRO: Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,
42: That you have such a February face,
43: So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?
44: CLAUDIO: I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
45: Tush, fear not, man; we'll tip thy horns with gold
46: And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,
47: As once Europa did at lusty Jove,
48: When he would play the noble beast in love.
49: BENEDICK: Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;
50: And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,
51: And got a calf in that same noble feat
52: Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.
53: CLAUDIO: For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.
54: Which is the lady I must seize upon?
55: ANTONIO: This same is she, and I do give you her.
56: CLAUDIO: Why, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.
57: LEONATO: No, that you shall not, till you take her hand
58: Before this friar and swear to marry her.
59: CLAUDIO: Give me your hand: before this holy friar,
60: I am your husband, if you like of me.
61: HERO: And when I lived, I was your other wife:
62: And when you loved, you were my other husband.
63: CLAUDIO: Another Hero!
64: HERO: Nothing certainer:
65: One Hero died defiled, but I do live,
66: And surely as I live, I am a maid.
67: DON PEDRO: The former Hero! Hero that is dead!
68: LEONATO: She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.
69: FRIAR FRANCIS: All this amazement can I qualify:
70: When after that the holy rites are ended,
71: I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death:
72: Meantime let wonder seem familiar,
73: And to the chapel let us presently.
74: BENEDICK: Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?
75: BEATRICE: [Unmasking] I answer to that name. What is your will?
76: BENEDICK: Do not you love me?
77: BEATRICE: Why, no; no more than reason.
78: BENEDICK: Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio
79: Have been deceived; they swore you did.
80: BEATRICE: Do not you love me?
81: BENEDICK: Troth, no; no more than reason.
82: BEATRICE: Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula
83: Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.
84: BENEDICK: They swore that you were almost sick for me.
85: BEATRICE: They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.
86: BENEDICK: 'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?
87: BEATRICE: No, truly, but in friendly recompense.
88: LEONATO: Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.
89: CLAUDIO: And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;
90: For here's a paper written in his hand,
91: A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
92: Fashion'd to Beatrice.
93: HERO: And here's another
94: Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket,
95: Containing her affection unto Benedick.
96: BENEDICK: A miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts.
97: Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take
98: thee for pity.
99: BEATRICE: I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield
100: upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,
101: for I was told you were in a consumption.
102: BENEDICK: Peace! I will stop your mouth.
103: DON PEDRO: How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?
104: BENEDICK: I'll tell thee what, prince; a college of
105: wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost
106: thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No:
107: if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear
108: nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do
109: purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any
110: purpose that the world can say against it; and
111: therefore never flout at me for what I have said
112: against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my
113: conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to
114: have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my
115: kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.
116: CLAUDIO: I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,
117: that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single
118: life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of
119: question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look
120: exceedingly narrowly to thee.
121: BENEDICK: Come, come, we are friends: let's have a dance ere
122: we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts
123: and our wives' heels.
124: LEONATO: We'll have dancing afterward.
125: BENEDICK: First, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince,
126: thou art sad; get thee a wife, get thee a wife:
127: there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.
128: Messenger: My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight,
129: And brought with armed men back to Messina.
