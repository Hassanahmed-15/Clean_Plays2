ACT 1 SCENE 1

1: KING RICHARD II: Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,
2: Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
3: Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,
4: Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,
5: Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
6: Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
7: JOHN OF GAUNT: I have, my liege.
8: KING RICHARD II: Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
9: If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;
10: Or worthily, as a good subject should,
11: On some known ground of treachery in him?
12: JOHN OF GAUNT: As near as I could sift him on that argument,
13: On some apparent danger seen in him
14: Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.
15: KING RICHARD II: Then call them to our presence; face to face,
16: And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
17: The accuser and the accused freely speak:
18: High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
19: In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.
20: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Many years of happy days befal
21: My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!
22: THOMAS MOWBRAY: Each day still better other's happiness;
23: Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,
24: Add an immortal title to your crown!
25: KING RICHARD II: We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
26: As well appeareth by the cause you come;
27: Namely to appeal each other of high treason.
28: Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object
29: Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
30: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: First, heaven be the record to my speech!
31: In the devotion of a subject's love,
32: Tendering the precious safety of my prince,
33: And free from other misbegotten hate,
34: Come I appellant to this princely presence.
35: Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
36: And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
37: My body shall make good upon this earth,
38: Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
39: Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,
40: Too good to be so and too bad to live,
41: Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
42: The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
43: Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
44: With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
45: And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
46: What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.
47: THOMAS MOWBRAY: Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
48: 'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
49: The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
50: Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;
51: The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:
52: Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
53: As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:
54: First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
55: From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;
56: Which else would post until it had return'd
57: These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
58: Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
59: And let him be no kinsman to my liege,
60: I do defy him, and I spit at him;
61: Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
62: Which to maintain I would allow him odds,
63: And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
64: Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,
65: Or any other ground inhabitable,
66: Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.
67: Mean time let this defend my loyalty,
68: By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.
69: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
70: Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,
71: And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
72: Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.
73: If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
74: As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
75: By that and all the rites of knighthood else,
76: Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
77: What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.
78: THOMAS MOWBRAY: I take it up; and by that sword I swear
79: Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,
80: I'll answer thee in any fair degree,
81: Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:
82: And when I mount, alive may I not light,
83: If I be traitor or unjustly fight!
84: KING RICHARD II: What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
85: It must be great that can inherit us
86: So much as of a thought of ill in him.
87: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;
88: That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
89: In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,
90: The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,
91: Like a false traitor and injurious villain.
92: Besides I say and will in battle prove,
93: Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
94: That ever was survey'd by English eye,
95: That all the treasons for these eighteen years
96: Complotted and contrived in this land
97: Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
98: Further I say and further will maintain
99: Upon his bad life to make all this good,
100: That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
101: Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
102: And consequently, like a traitor coward,
103: Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:
104: Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
105: Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
106: To me for justice and rough chastisement;
107: And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
108: This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.
109: KING RICHARD II: How high a pitch his resolution soars!
110: Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?
111: THOMAS MOWBRAY: O, let my sovereign turn away his face
112: And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
113: Till I have told this slander of his blood,
114: How God and good men hate so foul a liar.
115: KING RICHARD II: Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:
116: Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,
117: As he is but my father's brother's son,
118: Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,
119: Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
120: Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize
121: The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:
122: He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
123: Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.
124: THOMAS MOWBRAY: Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
125: Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.
126: Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
127: Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;
128: The other part reserved I by consent,
129: For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
130: Upon remainder of a dear account,
131: Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
132: Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,
133: I slew him not; but to my own disgrace
134: Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
135: For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
136: The honourable father to my foe
137: Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
138: A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
139: But ere I last received the sacrament
140: I did confess it, and exactly begg'd
141: Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.
142: This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,
143: It issues from the rancour of a villain,
144: A recreant and most degenerate traitor
145: Which in myself I boldly will defend;
146: And interchangeably hurl down my gage
147: Upon this overweening traitor's foot,
148: To prove myself a loyal gentleman
149: Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.
150: In haste whereof, most heartily I pray
151: Your highness to assign our trial day.
152: KING RICHARD II: Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;
153: Let's purge this choler without letting blood:
154: This we prescribe, though no physician;
155: Deep malice makes too deep incision;
156: Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;
157: Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.
158: Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
159: We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.
160: JOHN OF GAUNT: To be a make-peace shall become my age:
161: Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.
162: KING RICHARD II: And, Norfolk, throw down his.
163: JOHN OF GAUNT: When, Harry, when?
164: Obedience bids I should not bid again.
165: KING RICHARD II: Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.
166: THOMAS MOWBRAY: Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.
167: My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:
168: The one my duty owes; but my fair name,
169: Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
170: To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.
171: I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,
172: Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,
173: The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood
174: Which breathed this poison.
175: KING RICHARD II: Rage must be withstood:
176: Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.
177: THOMAS MOWBRAY: Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.
178: And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,
179: The purest treasure mortal times afford
180: Is spotless reputation: that away,
181: Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
182: A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest
183: Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.
184: Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:
185: Take honour from me, and my life is done:
186: Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;
187: In that I live and for that will I die.
188: KING RICHARD II: Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.
189: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
190: Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?
191: Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
192: Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue
193: Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,
194: Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
195: The slavish motive of recanting fear,
196: And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
197: Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.
198: KING RICHARD II: We were not born to sue, but to command;
199: Which since we cannot do to make you friends,
200: Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,
201: At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:
202: There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
203: The swelling difference of your settled hate:
204: Since we can not atone you, we shall see
205: Justice design the victor's chivalry.
206: Lord marshal, command our officers at arms
207: Be ready to direct these home alarms.
ACT 1 SCENE 2

1: JOHN OF GAUNT: Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood
2: Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,
3: To stir against the butchers of his life!
4: But since correction lieth in those hands
5: Which made the fault that we cannot correct,
6: Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;
7: Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,
8: Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.
9: DUCHESS: Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
10: Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
11: Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
12: Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,
13: Or seven fair branches springing from one root:
14: Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,
15: Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;
16: But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
17: One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,
18: One flourishing branch of his most royal root,
19: Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,
20: Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,
21: By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.
22: Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,
23: That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee
24: Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,
25: Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent
26: In some large measure to thy father's death,
27: In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
28: Who was the model of thy father's life.
29: Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
30: In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,
31: Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,
32: Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:
33: That which in mean men we intitle patience
34: Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
35: What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,
36: The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.
37: JOHN OF GAUNT: God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,
38: His deputy anointed in His sight,
39: Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,
40: Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift
41: An angry arm against His minister.
42: DUCHESS: Where then, alas, may I complain myself?
43: JOHN OF GAUNT: To God, the widow's champion and defence.
44: DUCHESS: Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.
45: Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold
46: Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:
47: O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,
48: That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!
49: Or, if misfortune miss the first career,
50: Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,
51: They may break his foaming courser's back,
52: And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
53: A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
54: Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife
55: With her companion grief must end her life.
56: JOHN OF GAUNT: Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:
57: As much good stay with thee as go with me!
58: DUCHESS: Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,
59: Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:
60: I take my leave before I have begun,
61: For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
62: Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.
63: Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;
64: Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
65: I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--
66: With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
67: Alack, and what shall good old York there see
68: But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
69: Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
70: And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
71: Therefore commend me; let him not come there,
72: To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
73: Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:
74: The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.
ACT 1 SCENE 3

1: Lord Marshal: My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?
2: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.
3: Lord Marshal: The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,
4: Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.
5: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay
6: For nothing but his majesty's approach.
7: KING RICHARD II: Marshal, demand of yonder champion
8: The cause of his arrival here in arms:
9: Ask him his name and orderly proceed
10: To swear him in the justice of his cause.
11: Lord Marshal: In God's name and the king's, say who thou art
12: And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms,
13: Against what man thou comest, and what thy quarrel:
14: Speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath;
15: As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!
16: THOMAS MOWBRAY: My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;
17: Who hither come engaged by my oath--
18: Which God defend a knight should violate!--
19: Both to defend my loyalty and truth
20: To God, my king and my succeeding issue,
21: Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me
22: And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,
23: To prove him, in defending of myself,
24: A traitor to my God, my king, and me:
25: And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!
26: KING RICHARD II: Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,
27: Both who he is and why he cometh hither
28: Thus plated in habiliments of war,
29: And formally, according to our law,
30: Depose him in the justice of his cause.
31: Lord Marshal: What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither,
32: Before King Richard in his royal lists?
33: Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?
34: Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!
35: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby
36: Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,
37: To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,
38: In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
39: That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,
40: To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;
41: And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!
42: Lord Marshal: On pain of death, no person be so bold
43: Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,
44: Except the marshal and such officers
45: Appointed to direct these fair designs.
46: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,
47: And bow my knee before his majesty:
48: For Mowbray and myself are like two men
49: That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;
50: Then let us take a ceremonious leave
51: And loving farewell of our several friends.
52: Lord Marshal: The appellant in all duty greets your highness,
53: And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.
54: KING RICHARD II: We will descend and fold him in our arms.
55: Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,
56: So be thy fortune in this royal fight!
57: Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,
58: Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.
59: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: O let no noble eye profane a tear
60: For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear:
61: As confident as is the falcon's flight
62: Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.
63: My loving lord, I take my leave of you;
64: Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;
65: Not sick, although I have to do with death,
66: But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.
67: Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet
68: The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:
69: O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
70: Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,
71: Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
72: To reach at victory above my head,
73: Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;
74: And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,
75: That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,
76: And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,
77: Even in the lusty havior of his son.
78: JOHN OF GAUNT: God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!
79: Be swift like lightning in the execution;
80: And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,
81: Fall like amazing thunder on the casque
82: Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:
83: Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live.
84: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!
85: THOMAS MOWBRAY: However God or fortune cast my lot,
86: There lives or dies, true to King Richard's throne,
87: A loyal, just and upright gentleman:
88: Never did captive with a freer heart
89: Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
90: His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,
91: More than my dancing soul doth celebrate
92: This feast of battle with mine adversary.
93: Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,
94: Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:
95: As gentle and as jocund as to jest
96: Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.
97: KING RICHARD II: Farewell, my lord: securely I espy
98: Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.
99: Order the trial, marshal, and begin.
100: Lord Marshal: Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,
101: Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!
102: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.
103: Lord Marshal: Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.
104: First Herald: Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,
105: Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,
106: On pain to be found false and recreant,
107: To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,
108: A traitor to his God, his king and him;
109: And dares him to set forward to the fight.
110: Second Herald: Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
111: On pain to be found false and recreant,
112: Both to defend himself and to approve
113: Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
114: To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal;
115: Courageously and with a free desire
116: Attending but the signal to begin.
117: Lord Marshal: Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants.
118: Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down.
119: KING RICHARD II: Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,
120: And both return back to their chairs again:
121: Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound
122: While we return these dukes what we decree.
123: Draw near,
124: And list what with our council we have done.
125: For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd
126: With that dear blood which it hath fostered;
127: And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
128: Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;
129: And for we think the eagle-winged pride
130: Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,
131: With rival-hating envy, set on you
132: To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle
133: Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;
134: Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,
135: With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,
136: And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,
137: Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
138: And make us wade even in our kindred's blood,
139: Therefore, we banish you our territories:
140: You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,
141: Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields
142: Shall not regreet our fair dominions,
143: But tread the stranger paths of banishment.
144: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Your will be done: this must my comfort be,
145: Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;
146: And those his golden beams to you here lent
147: Shall point on me and gild my banishment.
148: KING RICHARD II: Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,
149: Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:
150: The sly slow hours shall not determinate
151: The dateless limit of thy dear exile;
152: The hopeless word of 'never to return'
153: Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.
154: THOMAS MOWBRAY: A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,
155: And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:
156: A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
157: As to be cast forth in the common air,
158: Have I deserved at your highness' hands.
159: The language I have learn'd these forty years,
160: My native English, now I must forego:
161: And now my tongue's use is to me no more
162: Than an unstringed viol or a harp,
163: Or like a cunning instrument cased up,
164: Or, being open, put into his hands
165: That knows no touch to tune the harmony:
166: Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,
167: Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;
168: And dull unfeeling barren ignorance
169: Is made my gaoler to attend on me.
170: I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,
171: Too far in years to be a pupil now:
172: What is thy sentence then but speechless death,
173: Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?
174: KING RICHARD II: It boots thee not to be compassionate:
175: After our sentence plaining comes too late.
176: THOMAS MOWBRAY: Then thus I turn me from my country's light,
177: To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.
178: KING RICHARD II: Return again, and take an oath with thee.
179: Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;
180: Swear by the duty that you owe to God--
181: Our part therein we banish with yourselves--
182: To keep the oath that we administer:
183: You never shall, so help you truth and God!
184: Embrace each other's love in banishment;
185: Nor never look upon each other's face;
186: Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile
187: This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;
188: Nor never by advised purpose meet
189: To plot, contrive, or complot any ill
190: 'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.
191: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: I swear.
192: THOMAS MOWBRAY: And I, to keep all this.
193: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:--
194: By this time, had the king permitted us,
195: One of our souls had wander'd in the air.
196: Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,
197: As now our flesh is banish'd from this land:
198: Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;
199: Since thou hast far to go, bear not along
200: The clogging burthen of a guilty soul.
201: THOMAS MOWBRAY: No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,
202: My name be blotted from the book of life,
203: And I from heaven banish'd as from hence!
204: But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;
205: And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.
206: Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;
207: Save back to England, all the world's my way.
208: KING RICHARD II: Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes
209: I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect
210: Hath from the number of his banish'd years
211: Pluck'd four away.
212: Six frozen winter spent,
213: Return with welcome home from banishment.
214: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: How long a time lies in one little word!
215: Four lagging winters and four wanton springs
216: End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
217: JOHN OF GAUNT: I thank my liege, that in regard of me
218: He shortens four years of my son's exile:
219: But little vantage shall I reap thereby;
220: For, ere the six years that he hath to spend
221: Can change their moons and bring their times about
222: My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
223: Shall be extinct with age and endless night;
224: My inch of taper will be burnt and done,
225: And blindfold death not let me see my son.
226: KING RICHARD II: Why uncle, thou hast many years to live.
227: JOHN OF GAUNT: But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:
228: Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,
229: And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;
230: Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,
231: But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;
232: Thy word is current with him for my death,
233: But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.
234: KING RICHARD II: Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,
235: Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:
236: Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?
237: JOHN OF GAUNT: Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
238: You urged me as a judge; but I had rather
239: You would have bid me argue like a father.
240: O, had it been a stranger, not my child,
241: To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:
242: A partial slander sought I to avoid,
243: And in the sentence my own life destroy'd.
244: Alas, I look'd when some of you should say,
245: I was too strict to make mine own away;
246: But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
247: Against my will to do myself this wrong.
248: KING RICHARD II: Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:
249: Six years we banish him, and he shall go.
250: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,
251: From where you do remain let paper show.
252: Lord Marshal: My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,
253: As far as land will let me, by your side.
254: JOHN OF GAUNT: O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,
255: That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?
256: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: I have too few to take my leave of you,
257: When the tongue's office should be prodigal
258: To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.
259: JOHN OF GAUNT: Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.
260: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Joy absent, grief is present for that time.
261: JOHN OF GAUNT: What is six winters? they are quickly gone.
262: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.
263: JOHN OF GAUNT: Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.
264: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,
265: Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage.
266: JOHN OF GAUNT: The sullen passage of thy weary steps
267: Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
268: The precious jewel of thy home return.
269: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make
270: Will but remember me what a deal of world
271: I wander from the jewels that I love.
272: Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
273: To foreign passages, and in the end,
274: Having my freedom, boast of nothing else
275: But that I was a journeyman to grief?
276: JOHN OF GAUNT: All places that the eye of heaven visits
277: Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.
278: Teach thy necessity to reason thus;
279: There is no virtue like necessity.
280: Think not the king did banish thee,
281: But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,
282: Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.
283: Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour
284: And not the king exiled thee; or suppose
285: Devouring pestilence hangs in our air
286: And thou art flying to a fresher clime:
287: Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it
288: To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:
289: Suppose the singing birds musicians,
290: The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,
291: The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more
292: Than a delightful measure or a dance;
293: For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
294: The man that mocks at it and sets it light.
295: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: O, who can hold a fire in his hand
296: By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
297: Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
298: By bare imagination of a feast?
299: Or wallow naked in December snow
300: By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?
301: O, no! the apprehension of the good
302: Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
303: Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more
304: Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.
305: JOHN OF GAUNT: Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way:
306: Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.
307: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;
308: My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!
309: Where'er I wander, boast of this I can,
310: Though banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman.
ACT 1 SCENE 4

1: KING RICHARD II: We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,
2: How far brought you high Hereford on his way?
3: DUKE OF AUMERLE: I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
4: But to the next highway, and there I left him.
5: KING RICHARD II: And say, what store of parting tears were shed?
6: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,
7: Which then blew bitterly against our faces,
8: Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance
9: Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.
10: KING RICHARD II: What said our cousin when you parted with him?
11: DUKE OF AUMERLE: 'Farewell:'
12: And, for my heart disdained that my tongue
13: Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
14: To counterfeit oppression of such grief
15: That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.
16: Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours
17: And added years to his short banishment,
18: He should have had a volume of farewells;
19: But since it would not, he had none of me.
20: KING RICHARD II: He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,
21: When time shall call him home from banishment,
22: Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.
23: Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green
24: Observed his courtship to the common people;
25: How he did seem to dive into their hearts
26: With humble and familiar courtesy,
27: What reverence he did throw away on slaves,
28: Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
29: And patient underbearing of his fortune,
30: As 'twere to banish their affects with him.
31: Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;
32: A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
33: And had the tribute of his supple knee,
34: With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'
35: As were our England in reversion his,
36: And he our subjects' next degree in hope.
37: GREEN: Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts.
38: Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,
39: Expedient manage must be made, my liege,
40: Ere further leisure yield them further means
41: For their advantage and your highness' loss.
42: KING RICHARD II: We will ourself in person to this war:
43: And, for our coffers, with too great a court
44: And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,
45: We are inforced to farm our royal realm;
46: The revenue whereof shall furnish us
47: For our affairs in hand: if that come short,
48: Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;
49: Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,
50: They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
51: And send them after to supply our wants;
52: For we will make for Ireland presently.
53: Bushy, what news?
54: BUSHY: Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
55: Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste
56: To entreat your majesty to visit him.
57: KING RICHARD II: Where lies he?
58: BUSHY: At Ely House.
59: KING RICHARD II: Now put it, God, in the physician's mind
60: To help him to his grave immediately!
61: The lining of his coffers shall make coats
62: To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.
63: Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him:
64: Pray God we may make haste, and come too late!
ACT 2 SCENE 1

1: JOHN OF GAUNT: Will the king come, that I may breathe my last
2: In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?
3: DUKE OF YORK: Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
4: For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.
5: JOHN OF GAUNT: O, but they say the tongues of dying men
6: Enforce attention like deep harmony:
7: Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,
8: For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.
9: He that no more must say is listen'd more
10: Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;
11: More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:
12: The setting sun, and music at the close,
13: As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,
14: Writ in remembrance more than things long past:
15: Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,
16: My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.
17: DUKE OF YORK: No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,
18: As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,
19: Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
20: The open ear of youth doth always listen;
21: Report of fashions in proud Italy,
22: Whose manners still our tardy apish nation
23: Limps after in base imitation.
24: Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--
25: So it be new, there's no respect how vile--
26: That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?
27: Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,
28: Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.
29: Direct not him whose way himself will choose:
30: 'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.
31: JOHN OF GAUNT: Methinks I am a prophet new inspired
32: And thus expiring do foretell of him:
33: His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
34: For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
35: Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
36: He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
37: With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:
38: Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
39: Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
40: This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,
41: This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
42: This other Eden, demi-paradise,
43: This fortress built by Nature for herself
44: Against infection and the hand of war,
45: This happy breed of men, this little world,
46: This precious stone set in the silver sea,
47: Which serves it in the office of a wall,
48: Or as a moat defensive to a house,
49: Against the envy of less happier lands,
50: This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
51: This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,
52: Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,
53: Renowned for their deeds as far from home,
54: For Christian service and true chivalry,
55: As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,
56: Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son,
57: This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
58: Dear for her reputation through the world,
59: Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,
60: Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
61: England, bound in with the triumphant sea
62: Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
63: Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
64: With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:
65: That England, that was wont to conquer others,
66: Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
67: Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
68: How happy then were my ensuing death!
69: DUKE OF YORK: The king is come: deal mildly with his youth;
70: For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.
71: QUEEN: How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?
72: KING RICHARD II: What comfort, man? how is't with aged Gaunt?
73: JOHN OF GAUNT: O how that name befits my composition!
74: Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:
75: Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;
76: And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?
77: For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;
78: Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:
79: The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,
80: Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks;
81: And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:
82: Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,
83: Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.
84: KING RICHARD II: Can sick men play so nicely with their names?
85: JOHN OF GAUNT: No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
86: Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,
87: I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.
88: KING RICHARD II: Should dying men flatter with those that live?
89: JOHN OF GAUNT: No, no, men living flatter those that die.
90: KING RICHARD II: Thou, now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me.
91: JOHN OF GAUNT: O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.
92: KING RICHARD II: I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.
93: JOHN OF GAUNT: Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;
94: Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.
95: Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land
96: Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;
97: And thou, too careless patient as thou art,
98: Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure
99: Of those physicians that first wounded thee:
100: A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
101: Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;
102: And yet, incaged in so small a verge,
103: The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.
104: O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye
105: Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,
106: From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,
107: Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,
108: Which art possess'd now to depose thyself.
109: Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,
110: It were a shame to let this land by lease;
111: But for thy world enjoying but this land,
112: Is it not more than shame to shame it so?
113: Landlord of England art thou now, not king:
114: Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou--
115: KING RICHARD II: A lunatic lean-witted fool,
116: Presuming on an ague's privilege,
117: Darest with thy frozen admonition
118: Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood
119: With fury from his native residence.
120: Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,
121: Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,
122: This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
123: Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.
124: JOHN OF GAUNT: O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,
125: For that I was his father Edward's son;
126: That blood already, like the pelican,
127: Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:
128: My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,
129: Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls!
130: May be a precedent and witness good
131: That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood:
132: Join with the present sickness that I have;
133: And thy unkindness be like crooked age,
134: To crop at once a too long wither'd flower.
135: Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!
136: These words hereafter thy tormentors be!
137: Convey me to my bed, then to my grave:
138: Love they to live that love and honour have.
139: KING RICHARD II: And let them die that age and sullens have;
140: For both hast thou, and both become the grave.
141: DUKE OF YORK: I do beseech your majesty, impute his words
142: To wayward sickliness and age in him:
143: He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear
144: As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.
145: KING RICHARD II: Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his;
146: As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.
147: NORTHUMBERLAND: My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty.
148: KING RICHARD II: What says he?
149: NORTHUMBERLAND: Nay, nothing; all is said
150: His tongue is now a stringless instrument;
151: Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent.
152: DUKE OF YORK: Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
153: Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.
154: KING RICHARD II: The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;
155: His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.
156: So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:
157: We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,
158: Which live like venom where no venom else
159: But only they have privilege to live.
160: And for these great affairs do ask some charge,
161: Towards our assistance we do seize to us
162: The plate, corn, revenues and moveables,
163: Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd.
164: DUKE OF YORK: How long shall I be patient? ah, how long
165: Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
166: Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment
167: Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,
168: Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
169: About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,
170: Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,
171: Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.
172: I am the last of noble Edward's sons,
173: Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
174: In war was never lion raged more fierce,
175: In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
176: Than was that young and princely gentleman.
177: His face thou hast, for even so look'd he,
178: Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;
179: But when he frown'd, it was against the French
180: And not against his friends; his noble hand
181: Did will what he did spend and spent not that
182: Which his triumphant father's hand had won;
183: His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,
184: But bloody with the enemies of his kin.
185: O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,
186: Or else he never would compare between.
187: KING RICHARD II: Why, uncle, what's the matter?
188: DUKE OF YORK: O my liege,
189: Pardon me, if you please; if n ot, I, pleased
190: Not to be pardon'd, am content withal.
191: Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
192: The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?
193: Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?
194: Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?
195: Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
196: Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
197: Take Hereford's rights away, and take from Time
198: His charters and his customary rights;
199: Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;
200: Be not thyself; for how art thou a king
201: But by fair sequence and succession?
202: Now, afore God--God forbid I say true!--
203: If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,
204: Call in the letters patent that he hath
205: By his attorneys-general to sue
206: His livery, and deny his offer'd homage,
207: You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,
208: You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts
209: And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts
210: Which honour and allegiance cannot think.
211: KING RICHARD II: Think what you will, we seize into our hands
212: His plate, his goods, his money and his lands.
213: DUKE OF YORK: I'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell:
214: What will ensue hereof, there's none can tell;
215: But by bad courses may be understood
216: That their events can never fall out good.
217: KING RICHARD II: Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:
218: Bid him repair to us to Ely House
219: To see this business. To-morrow next
220: We will for Ireland; and 'tis time, I trow:
221: And we create, in absence of ourself,
222: Our uncle York lord governor of England;
223: For he is just and always loved us well.
224: Come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part;
225: Be merry, for our time of stay is short
226: NORTHUMBERLAND: Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.
227: LORD ROSS: And living too; for now his son is duke.
228: LORD WILLOUGHBY: Barely in title, not in revenue.
229: NORTHUMBERLAND: Richly in both, if justice had her right.
230: LORD ROSS: My heart is great; but it must break with silence,
231: Ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue.
232: NORTHUMBERLAND: Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more
233: That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!
234: LORD WILLOUGHBY: Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?
235: If it be so, out with it boldly, man;
236: Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.
237: LORD ROSS: No good at all that I can do for him;
238: Unless you call it good to pity him,
239: Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.
240: NORTHUMBERLAND: Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
241: In him, a royal prince, and many moe
242: Of noble blood in this declining land.
243: The king is not himself, but basely led
244: By flatterers; and what they will inform,
245: Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all,
246: That will the king severely prosecute
247: 'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.
248: LORD ROSS: The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes,
249: And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined
250: For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.
251: LORD WILLOUGHBY: And daily new exactions are devised,
252: As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what:
253: But what, o' God's name, doth become of this?
254: NORTHUMBERLAND: Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,
255: But basely yielded upon compromise
256: That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:
257: More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.
258: LORD ROSS: The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.
259: LORD WILLOUGHBY: The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man.
260: NORTHUMBERLAND: Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.
261: LORD ROSS: He hath not money for these Irish wars,
262: His burthenous taxations notwithstanding,
263: But by the robbing of the banish'd duke.
264: NORTHUMBERLAND: His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!
265: But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,
266: Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm;
267: We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,
268: And yet we strike not, but securely perish.
269: LORD ROSS: We see the very wreck that we must suffer;
270: And unavoided is the danger now,
271: For suffering so the causes of our wreck.
272: NORTHUMBERLAND: Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death
273: I spy life peering; but I dare not say
274: How near the tidings of our comfort is.
275: LORD WILLOUGHBY: Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.
276: LORD ROSS: Be confident to speak, Northumberland:
277: We three are but thyself; and, speaking so,
278: Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore, be bold.
279: NORTHUMBERLAND: Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay
280: In Brittany, received intelligence
281: That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,
282: That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,
283: His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,
284: Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,
285: Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,
286: All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne
287: With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,
288: Are making hither with all due expedience
289: And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:
290: Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay
291: The first departing of the king for Ireland.
292: If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,
293: Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,
294: Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
295: Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt
296: And make high majesty look like itself,
297: Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;
298: But if you faint, as fearing to do so,
299: Stay and be secret, and myself will go.
300: LORD ROSS: To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear.
301: LORD WILLOUGHBY: Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.
ACT 2 SCENE 2

1: BUSHY: Madam, your majesty is too much sad:
2: You promised, when you parted with the king,
3: To lay aside life-harming heaviness
4: And entertain a cheerful disposition.
5: QUEEN: To please the king I did; to please myself
6: I cannot do it; yet I know no cause
7: Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,
8: Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
9: As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,
10: Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,
11: Is coming towards me, and my inward soul
12: With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,
13: More than with parting from my lord the king.
14: BUSHY: Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
15: Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;
16: For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,
17: Divides one thing entire to many objects;
18: Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon
19: Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry
20: Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,
21: Looking awry upon your lord's departure,
22: Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;
23: Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows
24: Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
25: More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;
26: Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,
27: Which for things true weeps things imaginary.
28: QUEEN: It may be so; but yet my inward soul
29: Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,
30: I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad
31: As, though on thinking on no thought I think,
32: Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.
33: BUSHY: 'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.
34: QUEEN: 'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived
35: From some forefather grief; mine is not so,
36: For nothing had begot my something grief;
37: Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
38: 'Tis in reversion that I do possess;
39: But what it is, that is not yet known; what
40: I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.
41: GREEN: God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:
42: I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.
43: QUEEN: Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;
44: For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:
45: Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?
46: GREEN: That he, our hope, might have retired his power,
47: And driven into despair an enemy's hope,
48: Who strongly hath set footing in this land:
49: The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,
50: And with uplifted arms is safe arrived
51: At Ravenspurgh.
52: QUEEN: Now God in heaven forbid!
53: GREEN: Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,
54: The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,
55: The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,
56: With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.
57: BUSHY: Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
58: And all the rest revolted faction traitors?
59: GREEN: We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester
60: Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,
61: And all the household servants fled with him
62: To Bolingbroke.
63: QUEEN: So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
64: And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:
65: Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,
66: And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,
67: Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.
68: BUSHY: Despair not, madam.
69: QUEEN: Who shall hinder me?
70: I will despair, and be at enmity
71: With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,
72: A parasite, a keeper back of death,
73: Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,
74: Which false hope lingers in extremity.
75: GREEN: Here comes the Duke of York.
76: QUEEN: With signs of war about his aged neck:
77: O, full of careful business are his looks!
78: Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.
79: DUKE OF YORK: Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:
80: Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,
81: Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.
82: Your husband, he is gone to save far off,
83: Whilst others come to make him lose at home:
84: Here am I left to underprop his land,
85: Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:
86: Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;
87: Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.
88: Servant: My lord, your son was gone before I came.
89: DUKE OF YORK: He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!
90: The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,
91: And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.
92: Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;
93: Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:
94: Hold, take my ring.
95: Servant: My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,
96: To-day, as I came by, I called there;
97: But I shall grieve you to report the rest.
98: DUKE OF YORK: What is't, knave?
99: Servant: An hour before I came, the duchess died.
100: DUKE OF YORK: God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
101: Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!
102: I know not what to do: I would to God,
103: So my untruth had not provoked him to it,
104: The king had cut off my head with my brother's.
105: What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?
106: How shall we do for money for these wars?
107: Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardon me.
108: Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts
109: And bring away the armour that is there.
110: Gentlemen, will you go muster men?
111: If I know how or which way to order these affairs
112: Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,
113: Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:
114: The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath
115: And duty bids defend; the other again
116: Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,
117: Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.
118: Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll
119: Dispose of you.
120: Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,
121: And meet me presently at Berkeley.
122: I should to Plashy too;
123: But time will not permit: all is uneven,
124: And every thing is left at six and seven.
125: BUSHY: The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,
126: But none returns. For us to levy power
127: Proportionable to the enemy
128: Is all unpossible.
129: GREEN: Besides, our nearness to the king in love
130: Is near the hate of those love not the king.
131: BAGOT: And that's the wavering commons: for their love
132: Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them
133: By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.
134: BUSHY: Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.
135: BAGOT: If judgement lie in them, then so do we,
136: Because we ever have been near the king.
137: GREEN: Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:
138: The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.
139: BUSHY: Thither will I with you; for little office
140: The hateful commons will perform for us,
141: Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.
142: Will you go along with us?
143: BAGOT: No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.
144: Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,
145: We three here art that ne'er shall meet again.
146: BUSHY: That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.
147: GREEN: Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes
148: Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:
149: Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.
150: Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.
151: BUSHY: Well, we may meet again.
152: BAGOT: I fear me, never.
ACT 2 SCENE 3

1: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?
2: NORTHUMBERLAND: Believe me, noble lord,
3: I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:
4: These high wild hills and rough uneven ways
5: Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,
6: And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,
7: Making the hard way sweet and delectable.
8: But I bethink me what a weary way
9: From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found
10: In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,
11: Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled
12: The tediousness and process of my travel:
13: But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
14: The present benefit which I possess;
15: And hope to joy is little less in joy
16: Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords
17: Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done
18: By sight of what I have, your noble company.
19: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Of much less value is my company
20: Than your good words. But who comes here?
21: NORTHUMBERLAND: It is my son, young Harry Percy,
22: Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.
23: Harry, how fares your uncle?
24: HENRY PERCY: I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.
25: NORTHUMBERLAND: Why, is he not with the queen?
26: HENRY PERCY: No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,
27: Broken his staff of office and dispersed
28: The household of the king.
29: NORTHUMBERLAND: What was his reason?
30: He was not so resolved when last we spake together.
31: HENRY PERCY: Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
32: But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,
33: To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,
34: And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover
35: What power the Duke of York had levied there;
36: Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.
37: NORTHUMBERLAND: Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?
38: HENRY PERCY: No, my good lord, for that is not forgot
39: Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge,
40: I never in my life did look on him.
41: NORTHUMBERLAND: Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.
42: HENRY PERCY: My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
43: Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:
44: Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
45: To more approved service and desert.
46: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
47: I count myself in nothing else so happy
48: As in a soul remembering my good friends;
49: And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,
50: It shall be still thy true love's recompense:
51: My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.
52: NORTHUMBERLAND: How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir
53: Keeps good old York there with his men of war?
54: HENRY PERCY: There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,
55: Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;
56: And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;
57: None else of name and noble estimate.
58: NORTHUMBERLAND: Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
59: Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.
60: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
61: A banish'd traitor: all my treasury
62: Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd
63: Shall be your love and labour's recompense.
64: LORD ROSS: Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.
65: LORD WILLOUGHBY: And far surmounts our labour to attain it.
66: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
67: Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,
68: Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?
69: NORTHUMBERLAND: It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.
70: LORD BERKELEY: My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.
71: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;
72: And I am come to seek that name in England;
73: And I must find that title in your tongue,
74: Before I make reply to aught you say.
75: LORD BERKELEY: Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning
76: To raze one title of your honour out:
77: To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,
78: From the most gracious regent of this land,
79: The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on
80: To take advantage of the absent time
81: And fright our native peace with self-born arms.
82: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: I shall not need transport my words by you;
83: Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!
84: DUKE OF YORK: Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
85: Whose duty is deceiveable and false.
86: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: My gracious uncle--
87: DUKE OF YORK: Tut, tut!
88: Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:
89: I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'
90: In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
91: Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs
92: Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
93: But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march
94: So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,
95: Frighting her pale-faced villages with war
96: And ostentation of despised arms?
97: Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?
98: Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,
99: And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
100: Were I but now the lord of such hot youth
101: As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself
102: Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
103: From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
104: O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.
105: Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee
106: And minister correction to thy fault!
107: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
108: On what condition stands it and wherein?
109: DUKE OF YORK: Even in condition of the worst degree,
110: In gross rebellion and detested treason:
111: Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come
112: Before the expiration of thy time,
113: In braving arms against thy sovereign.
114: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;
115: But as I come, I come for Lancaster.
116: And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace
117: Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
118: You are my father, for methinks in you
119: I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,
120: Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd
121: A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
122: Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
123: To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?
124: If that my cousin king be King of England,
125: It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
126: You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;
127: Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,
128: He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,
129: To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.
130: I am denied to sue my livery here,
131: And yet my letters-patents give me leave:
132: My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,
133: And these and all are all amiss employ'd.
134: What would you have me do? I am a subject,
135: And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;
136: And therefore, personally I lay my claim
137: To my inheritance of free descent.
138: NORTHUMBERLAND: The noble duke hath been too much abused.
139: LORD ROSS: It stands your grace upon to do him right.
140: LORD WILLOUGHBY: Base men by his endowments are made great.
141: DUKE OF YORK: My lords of England, let me tell you this:
142: I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs
143: And laboured all I could to do him right;
144: But in this kind to come, in braving arms,
145: Be his own carver and cut out his way,
146: To find out right with wrong, it may not be;
147: And you that do abet him in this kind
148: Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.
149: NORTHUMBERLAND: The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
150: But for his own; and for the right of that
151: We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;
152: And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!
153: DUKE OF YORK: Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:
154: I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,
155: Because my power is weak and all ill left:
156: But if I could, by Him that gave me life,
157: I would attach you all and make you stoop
158: Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;
159: But since I cannot, be it known to you
160: I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;
161: Unless you please to enter in the castle
162: And there repose you for this night.
163: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
164: But we must win your grace to go with us
165: To Bristol castle, which they say is held
166: By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,
167: The caterpillars of the commonwealth,
168: Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.
169: DUKE OF YORK: It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;
170: For I am loath to break our country's laws.
171: Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:
172: Things past redress are now with me past care.
ACT 2 SCENE 4

1: Captain: My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days,
2: And hardly kept our countrymen together,
3: And yet we hear no tidings from the king;
4: Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell.
5: EARL OF SALISBURY: Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman:
6: The king reposeth all his confidence in thee.
7: Captain: 'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay.
8: The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd
9: And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;
10: The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth
11: And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;
12: Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap,
13: The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,
14: The other to enjoy by rage and war:
15: These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.
16: Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled,
17: As well assured Richard their king is dead.
ACT 3 SCENE 1

1: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Bring forth these men.
2: Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--
3: Since presently your souls must part your bodies--
4: With too much urging your pernicious lives,
5: For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood
6: From off my hands, here in the view of men
7: I will unfold some causes of your deaths.
8: You have misled a prince, a royal king,
9: A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
10: By you unhappied and disfigured clean:
11: You have in manner with your sinful hours
12: Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,
13: Broke the possession of a royal bed
14: And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks
15: With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.
16: Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,
17: Near to the king in blood, and near in love
18: Till you did make him misinterpret me,
19: Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,
20: And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,
21: Eating the bitter bread of banishment;
22: Whilst you have fed upon my signories,
23: Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,
24: From my own windows torn my household coat,
25: Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
26: Save men's opinions and my living blood,
27: To show the world I am a gentleman.
28: This and much more, much more than twice all this,
29: Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over
30: To execution and the hand of death.
31: BUSHY: More welcome is the stroke of death to me
32: Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.
33: GREEN: My comfort is that heaven will take our souls
34: And plague injustice with the pains of hell.
35: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.
36: Uncle, you say the queen is at your house;
37: For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated:
38: Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
39: Take special care my greetings be deliver'd.
40: DUKE OF YORK: A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd
41: With letters of your love to her at large.
42: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Thank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away.
43: To fight with Glendower and his complices:
44: Awhile to work, and after holiday.
ACT 3 SCENE 2

1: KING RICHARD II: Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?
2: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,
3: After your late tossing on the breaking seas?
4: KING RICHARD II: Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
5: To stand upon my kingdom once again.
6: Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
7: Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:
8: As a long-parted mother with her child
9: Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,
10: So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
11: And do thee favours with my royal hands.
12: Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,
13: Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;
14: But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,
15: And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,
16: Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
17: Which with usurping steps do trample thee:
18: Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;
19: And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
20: Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder
21: Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
22: Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
23: Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:
24: This earth shall have a feeling and these stones
25: Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king
26: Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.
27: BISHOP OF CARLISLE: Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king
28: Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
29: The means that heaven yields must be embraced,
30: And not neglected; else, if heaven would,
31: And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,
32: The proffer'd means of succor and redress.
33: DUKE OF AUMERLE: He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
34: Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,
35: Grows strong and great in substance and in power.
36: KING RICHARD II: Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
37: That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,
38: Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
39: Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
40: In murders and in outrage, boldly here;
41: But when from under this terrestrial ball
42: He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
43: And darts his light through every guilty hole,
44: Then murders, treasons and detested sins,
45: The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,
46: Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
47: So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
48: Who all this while hath revell'd in the night
49: Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,
50: Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
51: His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
52: Not able to endure the sight of day,
53: But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
54: Not all the water in the rough rude sea
55: Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
56: The breath of worldly men cannot depose
57: The deputy elected by the Lord:
58: For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
59: To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
60: God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
61: A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,
62: Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.
63: Welcome, my lord how far off lies your power?
64: EARL OF SALISBURY: Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
65: Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue
66: And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
67: One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,
68: Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:
69: O, call back yesterday, bid time return,
70: And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!
71: To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,
72: O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:
73: For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.
74: Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.
75: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?
76: KING RICHARD II: But now the blood of twenty thousand men
77: Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;
78: And, till so much blood thither come again,
79: Have I not reason to look pale and dead?
80: All souls that will be safe fly from my side,
81: For time hath set a blot upon my pride.
82: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
83: KING RICHARD II: I had forgot myself; am I not king?
84: Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.
85: Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?
86: Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
87: At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,
88: Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?
89: High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York
90: Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?
91: SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: More health and happiness betide my liege
92: Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!
93: KING RICHARD II: Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;
94: The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.
95: Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care
96: And what loss is it to be rid of care?
97: Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
98: Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,
99: We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:
100: Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;
101: They break their faith to God as well as us:
102: Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:
103: The worst is death, and death will have his day.
104: SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd
105: To bear the tidings of calamity.
106: Like an unseasonable stormy day,
107: Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,
108: As if the world were all dissolved to tears,
109: So high above his limits swells the rage
110: Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land
111: With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.
112: White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
113: Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,
114: Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
115: In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
116: The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
117: Of double-fatal yew against thy state;
118: Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills
119: Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,
120: And all goes worse than I have power to tell.
121: KING RICHARD II: Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.
122: Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?
123: What is become of Bushy? where is Green?
124: That they have let the dangerous enemy
125: Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?
126: If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:
127: I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.
128: SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.
129: KING RICHARD II: O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
130: Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!
131: Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!
132: Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!
133: Would they make peace? terrible hell make war
134: Upon their spotted souls for this offence!
135: SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
136: Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:
137: Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made
138: With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse
139: Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
140: And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.
141: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
142: SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.
143: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Where is the duke my father with his power?
144: KING RICHARD II: No matter where; of comfort no man speak:
145: Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
146: Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
147: Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,
148: Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
149: And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
150: Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
151: Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,
152: And nothing can we call our own but death
153: And that small model of the barren earth
154: Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
155: For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
156: And tell sad stories of the death of kings;
157: How some have been deposed; some slain in war,
158: Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
159: Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;
160: All murder'd: for within the hollow crown
161: That rounds the mortal temples of a king
162: Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,
163: Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,
164: Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
165: To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,
166: Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
167: As if this flesh which walls about our life,
168: Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus
169: Comes at the last and with a little pin
170: Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!
171: Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
172: With solemn reverence: throw away respect,
173: Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,
174: For you have but mistook me all this while:
175: I live with bread like you, feel want,
176: Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,
177: How can you say to me, I am a king?
178: BISHOP OF CARLISLE: My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
179: But presently prevent the ways to wail.
180: To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
181: Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,
182: And so your follies fight against yourself.
183: Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:
184: And fight and die is death destroying death;
185: Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.
186: DUKE OF AUMERLE: My father hath a power; inquire of him
187: And learn to make a body of a limb.
188: KING RICHARD II: Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come
189: To change blows with thee for our day of doom.
190: This ague fit of fear is over-blown;
191: An easy task it is to win our own.
192: Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?
193: Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.
194: SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: Men judge by the complexion of the sky
195: The state and inclination of the day:
196: So may you by my dull and heavy eye,
197: My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.
198: I play the torturer, by small and small
199: To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:
200: Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,
201: And all your northern castles yielded up,
202: And all your southern gentlemen in arms
203: Upon his party.
204: KING RICHARD II: Thou hast said enough.
205: Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth
206: Of that sweet way I was in to despair!
207: What say you now? what comfort have we now?
208: By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly
209: That bids me be of comfort any more.
210: Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;
211: A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
212: That power I have, discharge; and let them go
213: To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,
214: For I have none: let no man speak again
215: To alter this, for counsel is but vain.
216: DUKE OF AUMERLE: My liege, one word.
217: KING RICHARD II: He does me double wrong
218: That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.
219: Discharge my followers: let them hence away,
220: From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.
ACT 3 SCENE 3

1: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: So that by this intelligence we learn
2: The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury
3: Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed
4: With some few private friends upon this coast.
5: NORTHUMBERLAND: The news is very fair and good, my lord:
6: Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.
7: DUKE OF YORK: It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
8: To say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy day
9: When such a sacred king should hide his head.
10: NORTHUMBERLAND: Your grace mistakes; only to be brief
11: Left I his title out.
12: DUKE OF YORK: The time hath been,
13: Would you have been so brief with him, he would
14: Have been so brief with you, to shorten you,
15: For taking so the head, your whole head's length.
16: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.
17: DUKE OF YORK: Take not, good cousin, further than you should.
18: Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.
19: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself
20: Against their will. But who comes here?
21: Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?
22: HENRY PERCY: The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,
23: Against thy entrance.
24: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Royally!
25: Why, it contains no king?
26: HENRY PERCY: Yes, my good lord,
27: It doth contain a king; King Richard lies
28: Within the limits of yon lime and stone:
29: And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,
30: Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman
31: Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.
32: NORTHUMBERLAND: O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.
33: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Noble lords,
34: Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;
35: Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
36: Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:
37: Henry Bolingbroke
38: On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand
39: And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
40: To his most royal person, hither come
41: Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,
42: Provided that my banishment repeal'd
43: And lands restored again be freely granted:
44: If not, I'll use the advantage of my power
45: And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
46: Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:
47: The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
48: It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench
49: The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,
50: My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
51: Go, signify as much, while here we march
52: Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
53: Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,
54: That from this castle's tatter'd battlements
55: Our fair appointments may be well perused.
56: Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
57: With no less terror than the elements
58: Of fire and water, when their thundering shock
59: At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
60: Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:
61: The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
62: My waters; on the earth, and not on him.
63: March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.
64: See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,
65: As doth the blushing discontented sun
66: From out the fiery portal of the east,
67: When he perceives the envious clouds are bent
68: To dim his glory and to stain the track
69: Of his bright passage to the occident.
70: DUKE OF YORK: Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,
71: As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth
72: Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,
73: That any harm should stain so fair a show!
74: KING RICHARD II: We are amazed; and thus long have we stood
75: To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,
76: Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:
77: And if we be, how dare thy joints forget
78: To pay their awful duty to our presence?
79: If we be not, show us the hand of God
80: That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;
81: For well we know, no hand of blood and bone
82: Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,
83: Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.
84: And though you think that all, as you have done,
85: Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
86: And we are barren and bereft of friends;
87: Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,
88: Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
89: Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
90: Your children yet unborn and unbegot,
91: That lift your vassal hands against my head
92: And threat the glory of my precious crown.
93: Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--
94: That every stride he makes upon my land
95: Is dangerous treason: he is come to open
96: The purple testament of bleeding war;
97: But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,
98: Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
99: Shall ill become the flower of England's face,
100: Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace
101: To scarlet indignation and bedew
102: Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.
103: NORTHUMBERLAND: The king of heaven forbid our lord the king
104: Should so with civil and uncivil arms
105: Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin
106: Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;
107: And by the honourable tomb he swears,
108: That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,
109: And by the royalties of both your bloods,
110: Currents that spring from one most gracious head,
111: And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,
112: And by the worth and honour of himself,
113: Comprising all that may be sworn or said,
114: His coming hither hath no further scope
115: Than for his lineal royalties and to beg
116: Enfranchisement immediate on his kn ees:
117: Which on thy royal party granted once,
118: His glittering arms he will commend to rust,
119: His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart
120: To faithful service of your majesty.
121: This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;
122: And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.
123: KING RICHARD II: Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
124: His noble cousin is right welcome hither;
125: And all the number of his fair demands
126: Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction:
127: With all the gracious utterance thou hast
128: Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
129: We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,
130: To look so poorly and to speak so fair?
131: Shall we call back Northumberland, and send
132: Defiance to the traitor, and so die?
133: DUKE OF AUMERLE: No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
134: Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.
135: KING RICHARD II: O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine,
136: That laid the sentence of dread banishment
137: On yon proud man, should take it off again
138: With words of sooth! O that I were as great
139: As is my grief, or lesser than my name!
140: Or that I could forget what I have been,
141: Or not remember what I must be now!
142: Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,
143: Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.
144: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
145: KING RICHARD II: What must the king do now? must he submit?
146: The king shall do it: must he be deposed?
147: The king shall be contented: must he lose
148: The name of king? o' God's name, let it go:
149: I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,
150: My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,
151: My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,
152: My figured goblets for a dish of wood,
153: My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,
154: My subjects for a pair of carved saints
155: And my large kingdom for a little grave,
156: A little little grave, an obscure grave;
157: Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,
158: Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet
159: May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;
160: For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;
161: And buried once, why not upon my head?
162: Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!
163: We'll make foul weather with despised tears;
164: Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,
165: And make a dearth in this revolting land.
166: Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,
167: And make some pretty match with shedding tears?
168: As thus, to drop them still upon one place,
169: Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
170: Within the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies
171: Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.
172: Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see
173: I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.
174: Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,
175: What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty
176: Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?
177: You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.
178: NORTHUMBERLAND: My lord, in the base court he doth attend
179: To speak with you; may it please you to come down.
180: KING RICHARD II: Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,
181: Wanting the manage of unruly jades.
182: In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,
183: To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.
184: In the base court? Come down? Down, court!
185: down, king!
186: For night-owls shriek where mounting larks
187: should sing.
188: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: What says his majesty?
189: NORTHUMBERLAND: Sorrow and grief of heart
190: Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man
191: Yet he is come.
192: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Stand all apart,
193: And show fair duty to his majesty.
194: My gracious lord,--
195: KING RICHARD II: Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee
196: To make the base earth proud with kissing it:
197: Me rather had my heart might feel your love
198: Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.
199: Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,
200: Thus high at least, although your knee be low.
201: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.
202: KING RICHARD II: Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.
203: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
204: As my true service shall deserve your love.
205: KING RICHARD II: Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,
206: That know the strong'st and surest way to get.
207: Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;
208: Tears show their love, but want their remedies.
209: Cousin, I am too young to be your father,
210: Though you are old enough to be my heir.
211: What you will have, I'll give, and willing too;
212: For do we must what force will have us do.
213: Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?
214: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Yea, my good lord.
215: KING RICHARD II: Then I must not say no.
ACT 3 SCENE 4

1: QUEEN: What sport shall we devise here in this garden,
2: To drive away the heavy thought of care?
3: Lady: Madam, we'll play at bowls.
4: QUEEN: 'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,
5: And that my fortune rubs against the bias.
6: Lady: Madam, we'll dance.
7: QUEEN: My legs can keep no measure in delight,
8: When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:
9: Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport.
10: Lady: Madam, we'll tell tales.
11: QUEEN: Of sorrow or of joy?
12: Lady: Of either, madam.
13: QUEEN: Of neither, girl:
14: For of joy, being altogether wanting,
15: It doth remember me the more of sorrow;
16: Or if of grief, being altogether had,
17: It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:
18: For what I have I need not to repeat;
19: And what I want it boots not to complain.
20: Lady: Madam, I'll sing.
21: QUEEN: 'Tis well that thou hast cause
22: But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.
23: Lady: I could weep, madam, would it do you good.
24: QUEEN: And I could sing, would weeping do me good,
25: And never borrow any tear of thee.
26: But stay, here come the gardeners:
27: Let's step into the shadow of these trees.
28: My wretchedness unto a row of pins,
29: They'll talk of state; for every one doth so
30: Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.
31: Gardener: Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,
32: Which, like unruly children, make their sire
33: Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:
34: Give some supportance to the bending twigs.
35: Go thou, and like an executioner,
36: Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
37: That look too lofty in our commonwealth:
38: All must be even in our government.
39: You thus employ'd, I will go root away
40: The noisome weeds, which without profit suck
41: The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.
42: Servant: Why should we in the compass of a pale
43: Keep law and form and due proportion,
44: Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,
45: When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,
46: Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,
47: Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd,
48: Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs
49: Swarming with caterpillars?
50: Gardener: Hold thy peace:
51: He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring
52: Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:
53: The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,
54: That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,
55: Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke,
56: I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.
57: Servant: What, are they dead?
58: Gardener: They are; and Bolingbroke
59: Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it
60: That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
61: As we this garden! We at time of year
62: Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,
63: Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,
64: With too much riches it confound itself:
65: Had he done so to great and growing men,
66: They might have lived to bear and he to taste
67: Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches
68: We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:
69: Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,
70: Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.
71: Servant: What, think you then the king shall be deposed?
72: Gardener: Depress'd he is already, and deposed
73: 'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night
74: To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,
75: That tell black tidings.
76: QUEEN: O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!
77: Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,
78: How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?
79: What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee
80: To make a second fall of cursed man?
81: Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?
82: Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,
83: Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,
84: Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.
85: Gardener: Pardon me, madam: little joy have I
86: To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.
87: King Richard, he is in the mighty hold
88: Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd:
89: In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,
90: And some few vanities that make him light;
91: But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,
92: Besides himself, are all the English peers,
93: And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.
94: Post you to London, and you will find it so;
95: I speak no more than every one doth know.
96: QUEEN: Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
97: Doth not thy embassage belong to me,
98: And am I last that knows it? O, thou think'st
99: To serve me last, that I may longest keep
100: Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,
101: To meet at London London's king in woe.
102: What, was I born to this, that my sad look
103: Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?
104: Gardener, for telling me these news of woe,
105: Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.
ACT 4 SCENE 1

1: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Call forth Bagot.
2: Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;
3: What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death,
4: Who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd
5: The bloody office of his timeless end.
6: BAGOT: Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.
7: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.
8: BAGOT: My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
9: Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.
10: In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,
11: I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,
12: That reacheth from the restful English court
13: As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'
14: Amongst much other talk, that very time,
15: I heard you say that you had rather refuse
16: The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
17: Than Bolingbroke's return to England;
18: Adding withal how blest this land would be
19: In this your cousin's death.
20: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Princes and noble lords,
21: What answer shall I make to this base man?
22: Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,
23: On equal terms to give him chastisement?
24: Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd
25: With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
26: There is my gage, the manual seal of death,
27: That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,
28: And will maintain what thou hast said is false
29: In thy heart-blood, though being all too base
30: To stain the temper of my knightly sword.
31: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.
32: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Excepting one, I would he were the best
33: In all this presence that hath moved me so.
34: LORD FITZWATER: If that thy valour stand on sympathy,
35: There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:
36: By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,
37: I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it
38: That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.
39: If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;
40: And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,
41: Where it was forged, with my rapier's point.
42: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.
43: LORD FITZWATER: Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.
44: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.
45: HENRY PERCY: Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true
46: In this appeal as thou art all unjust;
47: And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,
48: To prove it on thee to the extremest point
49: Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest.
50: DUKE OF AUMERLE: An if I do not, may my hands rot off
51: And never brandish more revengeful steel
52: Over the glittering helmet of my foe!
53: Lord: I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;
54: And spur thee on with full as many lies
55: As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear
56: From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;
57: Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.
58: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:
59: I have a thousand spirits in one breast,
60: To answer twenty thousand such as you.
61: DUKE OF SURREY: My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
62: The very time Aumerle and you did talk.
63: LORD FITZWATER: 'Tis very true: you were in presence then;
64: And you can witness with me this is true.
65: DUKE OF SURREY: As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.
66: LORD FITZWATER: Surrey, thou liest.
67: DUKE OF SURREY: Dishonourable boy!
68: That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,
69: That it shall render vengeance and revenge
70: Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie
71: In earth as quiet as thy father's skull:
72: In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
73: Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.
74: LORD FITZWATER: How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
75: If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,
76: I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,
77: And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,
78: And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith,
79: To tie thee to my strong correction.
80: As I intend to thrive in this new world,
81: Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:
82: Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say
83: That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men
84: To execute the noble duke at Calais.
85: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
86: That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,
87: If he may be repeal'd, to try his honour.
88: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: These differences shall all rest under gage
89: Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be,
90: And, though mine enemy, restored again
91: To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,
92: Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.
93: BISHOP OF CARLISLE: That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.
94: Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought
95: For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,
96: Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
97: Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:
98: And toil'd with works of war, retired himself
99: To Italy; and there at Venice gave
100: His body to that pleasant country's earth,
101: And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,
102: Under whose colours he had fought so long.
103: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?
104: BISHOP OF CARLISLE: As surely as I live, my lord.
105: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
106: Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,
107: Your differences shall all rest under gage
108: Till we assign you to your days of trial.
109: DUKE OF YORK: Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee
110: From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul
111: Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields
112: To the possession of thy royal hand:
113: Ascend his throne, descending now from him;
114: And long live Henry, fourth of that name!
115: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.
116: BISHOP OF CARLISLE: Marry. God forbid!
117: Worst in this royal presence may I speak,
118: Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.
119: Would God that any in this noble presence
120: Were enough noble to be upright judge
121: Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would
122: Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
123: What subject can give sentence on his king?
124: And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?
125: Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,
126: Although apparent guilt be seen in them;
127: And shall the figure of God's majesty,
128: His captain, steward, deputy-elect,
129: Anointed, crowned, planted many years,
130: Be judged by subject and inferior breath,
131: And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,
132: That in a Christian climate souls refined
133: Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!
134: I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
135: Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:
136: My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,
137: Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king:
138: And if you crown him, let me prophesy:
139: The blood of English shall manure the ground,
140: And future ages groan for this foul act;
141: Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,
142: And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
143: Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;
144: Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny
145: Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd
146: The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.
147: O, if you raise this house against this house,
148: It will the woefullest division prove
149: That ever fell upon this cursed earth.
150: Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,
151: Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe!
152: NORTHUMBERLAND: Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,
153: Of capital treason we arrest you here.
154: My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge
155: To keep him safely till his day of trial.
156: May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit.
157: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Fetch hither Richard, that in common view
158: He may surrender; so we shall proceed
159: Without suspicion.
160: DUKE OF YORK: I will be his conduct.
161: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
162: Procure your sureties for your days of answer.
163: Little are we beholding to your love,
164: And little look'd for at your helping hands.
165: KING RICHARD II: Alack, why am I sent for to a king,
166: Before I have shook off the regal thoughts
167: Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd
168: To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:
169: Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
170: To this submission. Yet I well remember
171: The favours of these men: were they not mine?
172: Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?
173: So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve,
174: Found truth in all but one: I, in twelve thousand, none.
175: God save the king! Will no man say amen?
176: Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.
177: God save the king! although I be not he;
178: And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.
179: To do what service am I sent for hither?
180: DUKE OF YORK: To do that office of thine own good will
181: Which tired majesty did make thee offer,
182: The resignation of thy state and crown
183: To Henry Bolingbroke.
184: KING RICHARD II: Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;
185: Here cousin:
186: On this side my hand, and on that side yours.
187: Now is this golden crown like a deep well
188: That owes two buckets, filling one another,
189: The emptier ever dancing in the air,
190: The other down, unseen and full of water:
191: That bucket down and full of tears am I,
192: Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.
193: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: I thought you had been willing to resign.
194: KING RICHARD II: My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:
195: You may my glories and my state depose,
196: But not my griefs; still am I king of those.
197: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
198: KING RICHARD II: Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
199: My care is loss of care, by old care done;
200: Your care is gain of care, by new care won:
201: The cares I give I have, though given away;
202: They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.
203: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Are you contented to resign the crown?
204: KING RICHARD II: Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;
205: Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.
206: Now mark me, how I will undo myself;
207: I give this heavy weight from off my head
208: And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,
209: The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;
210: With mine own tears I wash away my balm,
211: With mine own hands I give away my crown,
212: With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,
213: With mine own breath release all duty's rites:
214: All pomp and majesty I do forswear;
215: My manors, rents, revenues I forego;
216: My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:
217: God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!
218: God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!
219: Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,
220: And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!
221: Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,
222: And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!
223: God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,
224: And send him many years of sunshine days!
225: What more remains?
226: NORTHUMBERLAND: No more, but that you read
227: These accusations and these grievous crimes
228: Committed by your person and your followers
229: Against the state and profit of this land;
230: That, by confessing them, the souls of men
231: May deem that you are worthily deposed.
232: KING RICHARD II: Must I do so? and must I ravel out
233: My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,
234: If thy offences were upon record,
235: Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
236: To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,
237: There shouldst thou find one heinous article,
238: Containing the deposing of a king
239: And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,
240: Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven:
241: Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,
242: Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,
243: Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands
244: Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates
245: Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,
246: And water cannot wash away your sin.
247: NORTHUMBERLAND: My lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles.
248: KING RICHARD II: Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:
249: And yet salt water blinds them not so much
250: But they can see a sort of traitors here.
251: Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,
252: I find myself a traitor with the rest;
253: For I have given here my soul's consent
254: To undeck the pompous body of a king;
255: Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,
256: Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.
257: NORTHUMBERLAND: My lord,--
258: KING RICHARD II: No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
259: Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no title,
260: No, not that name was given me at the font,
261: But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day,
262: That I have worn so many winters out,
263: And know not now what name to call myself!
264: O that I were a mockery king of snow,
265: Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,
266: To melt myself away in water-drops!
267: Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,
268: An if my word be sterling yet in England,
269: Let it command a mirror hither straight,
270: That it may show me what a face I have,
271: Since it is bankrupt of his majesty.
272: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.
273: NORTHUMBERLAND: Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.
274: KING RICHARD II: Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!
275: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.
276: NORTHUMBERLAND: The commons will not then be satisfied.
277: KING RICHARD II: They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough,
278: When I do see the very book indeed
279: Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself.
280: Give me the glass, and therein will I read.
281: No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
282: So many blows upon this face of mine,
283: And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,
284: Like to my followers in prosperity,
285: Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face
286: That every day under his household roof
287: Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face
288: That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
289: Was this the face that faced so many follies,
290: And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?
291: A brittle glory shineth in this face:
292: As brittle as the glory is the face;
293: For there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers.
294: Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,
295: How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.
296: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
297: The shadow or your face.
298: KING RICHARD II: Say that again.
299: The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:
300: 'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;
301: And these external manners of laments
302: Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
303: That swells with silence in the tortured soul;
304: There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,
305: For thy great bounty, that not only givest
306: Me cause to wail but teachest me the way
307: How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,
308: And then be gone and trouble you no more.
309: Shall I obtain it?
310: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Name it, fair cousin.
311: KING RICHARD II: 'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:
312: For when I was a king, my flatterers
313: Were then but subjects; being now a subject,
314: I have a king here to my flatterer.
315: Being so great, I have no need to beg.
316: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Yet ask.
317: KING RICHARD II: And shall I have?
318: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: You shall.
319: KING RICHARD II: Then give me leave to go.
320: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Whither?
321: KING RICHARD II: Whither you will, so I were from your sights.
322: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.
323: KING RICHARD II: O, good! convey? conveyers are you all,
324: That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.
325: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
326: Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves.
327: Abbot: A woeful pageant have we here beheld.
328: BISHOP OF CARLISLE: The woe's to come; the children yet unborn.
329: Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.
330: DUKE OF AUMERLE: You holy clergymen, is there no plot
331: To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?
ACT 5 SCENE 1

1: QUEEN: This way the king will come; this is the way
2: To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,
3: To whose flint bosom my condemned lord
4: Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:
5: Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth
6: Have any resting for her true king's queen.
7: But soft, but see, or rather do not see,
8: My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,
9: That you in pity may dissolve to dew,
10: And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.
11: Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,
12: Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,
13: And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,
14: Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee,
15: When triumph is become an alehouse guest?
16: KING RICHARD II: Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,
17: To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,
18: To think our former state a happy dream;
19: From which awaked, the truth of what we are
20: Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,
21: To grim Necessity, and he and I
22: Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France
23: And cloister thee in some religious house:
24: Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,
25: Which our profane hours here have stricken down.
26: QUEEN: What, is my Richard both in shape and mind
27: Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed
28: Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?
29: The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,
30: And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage
31: To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,
32: Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
33: And fawn on rage with base humility,
34: Which art a lion and a king of beasts?
35: KING RICHARD II: A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,
36: I had been still a happy king of men.
37: Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:
38: Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,
39: As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.
40: In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire
41: With good old folks and let them tell thee tales
42: Of woeful ages long ago betid;
43: And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,
44: Tell thou the lamentable tale of me
45: And send the hearers weeping to their beds:
46: For why, the senseless brands will sympathize
47: The heavy accent of thy moving tongue
48: And in compassion weep the fire out;
49: And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,
50: For the deposing of a rightful king.
51: NORTHUMBERLAND: My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:
52: You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.
53: And, madam, there is order ta'en for you;
54: With all swift speed you must away to France.
55: KING RICHARD II: Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal
56: The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,
57: The time shall not be many hours of age
58: More than it is ere foul sin gathering head
59: Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,
60: Though he divide the realm and give thee half,
61: It is too little, helping him to all;
62: And he shall think that thou, which know'st the way
63: To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,
64: Being ne'er so little urged, another way
65: To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.
66: The love of wicked men converts to fear;
67: That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both
68: To worthy danger and deserved death.
69: NORTHUMBERLAND: My guilt be on my head, and there an end.
70: Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.
71: KING RICHARD II: Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate
72: A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,
73: And then betwixt me and my married wife.
74: Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;
75: And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.
76: Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,
77: Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;
78: My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,
79: She came adorned hither like sweet May,
80: Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.
81: QUEEN: And must we be divided? must we part?
82: KING RICHARD II: Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.
83: QUEEN: Banish us both and send the king with me.
84: NORTHUMBERLAND: That were some love but little policy.
85: QUEEN: Then whither he goes, thither let me go.
86: KING RICHARD II: So two, together weeping, make one woe.
87: Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;
88: Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.
89: Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.
90: QUEEN: So longest way shall have the longest moans.
91: KING RICHARD II: Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,
92: And piece the way out with a heavy heart.
93: Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,
94: Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;
95: One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;
96: Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.
97: QUEEN: Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
98: To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.
99: So, now I have mine own again, be gone,
100: That I might strive to kill it with a groan.
101: KING RICHARD II: We make woe wanton with this fond delay:
102: Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.
ACT 5 SCENE 2

1: DUCHESS OF YORK: My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
2: When weeping made you break the story off,
3: of our two cousins coming into London.
4: DUKE OF YORK: Where did I leave?
5: DUCHESS OF YORK: At that sad stop, my lord,
6: Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops
7: Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.
8: DUKE OF YORK: Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,
9: Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
10: Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,
11: With slow but stately pace kept on his course,
12: Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,
13: Bolingbroke!'
14: You would have thought the very windows spake,
15: So many greedy looks of young and old
16: Through casements darted their desiring eyes
17: Upon his visage, and that all the walls
18: With painted imagery had said at once
19: 'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'
20: Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,
21: Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,
22: Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'
23: And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.
24: DUCHESS OF YORK: Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?
25: DUKE OF YORK: As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
26: After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,
27: Are idly bent on him that enters next,
28: Thinking his prattle to be tedious;
29: Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes
30: Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'
31: No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
32: But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
33: Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,
34: His face still combating with tears and smiles,
35: The badges of his grief and patience,
36: That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd
37: The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted
38: And barbarism itself have pitied him.
39: But heaven hath a hand in these events,
40: To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
41: To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,
42: Whose state and honour I for aye allow.
43: DUCHESS OF YORK: Here comes my son Aumerle.
44: DUKE OF YORK: Aumerle that was;
45: But that is lost for being Richard's friend,
46: And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:
47: I am in parliament pledge for his truth
48: And lasting fealty to the new-made king.
49: DUCHESS OF YORK: Welcome, my son: who are the violets now
50: That strew the green lap of the new come spring?
51: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:
52: God knows I had as lief be none as one.
53: DUKE OF YORK: Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,
54: Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
55: What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?
56: DUKE OF AUMERLE: For aught I know, my lord, they do.
57: DUKE OF YORK: You will be there, I know.
58: DUKE OF AUMERLE: If God prevent not, I purpose so.
59: DUKE OF YORK: What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?
60: Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing.
61: DUKE OF AUMERLE: My lord, 'tis nothing.
62: DUKE OF YORK: No matter, then, who see it;
63: I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.
64: DUKE OF AUMERLE: I do beseech your grace to pardon me:
65: It is a matter of small consequence,
66: Which for some reasons I would not have seen.
67: DUKE OF YORK: Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.
68: I fear, I fear,--
69: DUCHESS OF YORK: What should you fear?
70: 'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into
71: For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.
72: DUKE OF YORK: Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond
73: That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.
74: Boy, let me see the writing.
75: DUKE OF AUMERLE: I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.
76: DUKE OF YORK: I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.
77: Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!
78: DUCHESS OF YORK: What is the matter, my lord?
79: DUKE OF YORK: Ho! who is within there?
80: Saddle my horse.
81: God for his mercy, what treachery is here!
82: DUCHESS OF YORK: Why, what is it, my lord?
83: DUKE OF YORK: Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.
84: Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth,
85: I will appeach the villain.
86: DUCHESS OF YORK: What is the matter?
87: DUKE OF YORK: Peace, foolish woman.
88: DUCHESS OF YORK: I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle.
89: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Good mother, be content; it is no more
90: Than my poor life must answer.
91: DUCHESS OF YORK: Thy life answer!
92: DUKE OF YORK: Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.
93: DUCHESS OF YORK: Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed.
94: Hence, villain! never more come in my sight.
95: DUKE OF YORK: Give me my boots, I say.
96: DUCHESS OF YORK: Why, York, what wilt thou do?
97: Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?
98: Have we more sons? or are we like to have?
99: Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?
100: And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,
101: And rob me of a happy mother's name?
102: Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?
103: DUKE OF YORK: Thou fond mad woman,
104: Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?
105: A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,
106: And interchangeably set down their hands,
107: To kill the king at Oxford.
108: DUCHESS OF YORK: He shall be none;
109: We'll keep him here: then what is that to him?
110: DUKE OF YORK: Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son,
111: I would appeach him.
112: DUCHESS OF YORK: Hadst thou groan'd for him
113: As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.
114: But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect
115: That I have been disloyal to thy bed,
116: And that he is a bastard, not thy son:
117: Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:
118: He is as like thee as a man may be,
119: Not like to me, or any of my kin,
120: And yet I love him.
121: DUKE OF YORK: Make way, unruly woman!
122: DUCHESS OF YORK: After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;
123: Spur post, and get before him to the king,
124: And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.
125: I'll not be long behind; though I be old,
126: I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:
127: And never will I rise up from the ground
128: Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone!
ACT 5 SCENE 3

1: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?
2: 'Tis full three months since I did see him last;
3: If any plague hang over us, 'tis he.
4: I would to God, my lords, he might be found:
5: Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there,
6: For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,
7: With unrestrained loose companions,
8: Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,
9: And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;
10: Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,
11: Takes on the point of honour to support
12: So dissolute a crew.
13: HENRY PERCY: My lord, some two days since I saw the prince,
14: And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.
15: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: And what said the gallant?
16: HENRY PERCY: His answer was, he would unto the stews,
17: And from the common'st creature pluck a glove,
18: And wear it as a favour; and with that
19: He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.
20: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: As dissolute as desperate; yet through both
21: I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years
22: May happily bring forth. But who comes here?
23: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Where is the king?
24: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: What means our cousin, that he stares and looks
25: So wildly?
26: DUKE OF AUMERLE: God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,
27: To have some conference with your grace alone.
28: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.
29: What is the matter with our cousin now?
30: DUKE OF AUMERLE: For ever may my knees grow to the earth,
31: My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
32: Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
33: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Intended or committed was this fault?
34: If on the first, how heinous e'er it be,
35: To win thy after-love I pardon thee.
36: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Then give me leave that I may turn the key,
37: That no man enter till my tale be done.
38: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Have thy desire.
39: DUKE OF YORK: [Within] My liege, beware; look to thyself;
40: Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there.
41: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Villain, I'll make thee safe.
42: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.
43: DUKE OF YORK: [Within] Open the door, secure, foolhardy king:
44: Shall I for love speak treason to thy face?
45: Open the door, or I will break it open.
46: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: What is the matter, uncle? speak;
47: Recover breath; tell us how near is danger,
48: That we may arm us to encounter it.
49: DUKE OF YORK: Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know
50: The treason that my haste forbids me show.
51: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:
52: I do repent me; read not my name there
53: My heart is not confederate with my hand.
54: DUKE OF YORK: It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.
55: I tore it from the traitor's bosom, king;
56: Fear, and not love, begets his penitence:
57: Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove
58: A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.
59: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!
60: O loyal father of a treacherous son!
61: Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,
62: From when this stream through muddy passages
63: Hath held his current and defiled himself!
64: Thy overflow of good converts to bad,
65: And thy abundant goodness shall excuse
66: This deadly blot in thy digressing son.
67: DUKE OF YORK: So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;
68: And he shall spend mine honour with his shame,
69: As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold.
70: Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,
71: Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:
72: Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath,
73: The traitor lives, the true man's put to death.
74: DUCHESS OF YORK: [Within] What ho, my liege! for God's sake,
75: let me in.
76: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?
77: DUCHESS OF YORK: A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.
78: Speak with me, pity me, open the door.
79: A beggar begs that never begg'd before.
80: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing,
81: And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.'
82: My dangerous cousin, let your mother in:
83: I know she is come to pray for your foul sin.
84: DUKE OF YORK: If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,
85: More sins for this forgiveness prosper may.
86: This fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound;
87: This let alone will all the rest confound.
88: DUCHESS OF YORK: O king, believe not this hard-hearted man!
89: Love loving not itself none other can.
90: DUKE OF YORK: Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?
91: Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?
92: DUCHESS OF YORK: Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.
93: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Rise up, good aunt.
94: DUCHESS OF YORK: Not yet, I thee beseech:
95: For ever will I walk upon my knees,
96: And never see day that the happy sees,
97: Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,
98: By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.
99: DUKE OF AUMERLE: Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.
100: DUKE OF YORK: Against them both my true joints bended be.
101: Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!
102: DUCHESS OF YORK: Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;
103: His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;
104: His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:
105: He prays but faintly and would be denied;
106: We pray with heart and soul and all beside:
107: His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;
108: Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:
109: His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;
110: Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
111: Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have
112: That mercy which true prayer ought to have.
113: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Good aunt, stand up.
114: DUCHESS OF YORK: Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'
115: Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'
116: And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
117: 'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.
118: I never long'd to hear a word till now;
119: Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:
120: The word is short, but not so short as sweet;
121: No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.
122: DUKE OF YORK: Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'
123: DUCHESS OF YORK: Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
124: Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,
125: That set'st the word itself against the word!
126: Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;
127: The chopping French we do not understand.
128: Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;
129: Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;
130: That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,
131: Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.
132: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Good aunt, stand up.
133: DUCHESS OF YORK: I do not sue to stand;
134: Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.
135: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.
136: DUCHESS OF YORK: O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
137: Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;
138: Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,
139: But makes one pardon strong.
140: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: With all my heart
141: I pardon him.
142: DUCHESS OF YORK: A god on earth thou art.
143: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,
144: With all the rest of that consorted crew,
145: Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.
146: Good uncle, help to order several powers
147: To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are:
148: They shall not live within this world, I swear,
149: But I will have them, if I once know where.
150: Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:
151: Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.
152: DUCHESS OF YORK: Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new.
ACT 5 SCENE 4

1: EXTON: Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,
2: 'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?'
3: Was it not so?
4: Servant: These were his very words.
5: EXTON: 'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,
6: And urged it twice together, did he not?
7: Servant: He did.
8: EXTON: And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me,
9: And who should say, 'I would thou wert the man'
10: That would divorce this terror from my heart;'
11: Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go:
12: I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe.
ACT 5 SCENE 5

1: KING RICHARD II: I have been studying how I may compare
2: This prison where I live unto the world:
3: And for because the world is populous
4: And here is not a creature but myself,
5: I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.
6: My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,
7: My soul the father; and these two beget
8: A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
9: And these same thoughts people this little world,
10: In humours like the people of this world,
11: For no thought is contented. The better sort,
12: As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
13: With scruples and do set the word itself
14: Against the word:
15: As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,
16: 'It is as hard to come as for a camel
17: To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
18: Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
19: Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
20: May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
21: Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
22: And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
23: Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
24: That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
25: Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars
26: Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,
27: That many have and others must sit there;
28: And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
29: Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
30: Of such as have before endured the like.
31: Thus play I in one person many people,
32: And none contented: sometimes am I king;
33: Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
34: And so I am: then crushing penury
35: Persuades me I was better when a king;
36: Then am I king'd again: and by and by
37: Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
38: And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,
39: Nor I nor any man that but man is
40: With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased
41: With being nothing. Music do I hear?
42: Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,
43: When time is broke and no proportion kept!
44: So is it in the music of men's lives.
45: And here have I the daintiness of ear
46: To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;
47: But for the concord of my state and time
48: Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
49: I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
50: For now hath time made me his numbering clock:
51: My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
52: Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
53: Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
54: Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
55: Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
56: Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,
57: Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans
58: Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time
59: Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
60: While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.
61: This music mads me; let it sound no more;
62: For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
63: In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
64: Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
65: For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
66: Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.
67: Groom: Hail, royal prince!
68: KING RICHARD II: Thanks, noble peer;
69: The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.
70: What art thou? and how comest thou hither,
71: Where no man never comes but that sad dog
72: That brings me food to make misfortune live?
73: Groom: I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,
74: When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,
75: With much ado at length have gotten leave
76: To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.
77: O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld
78: In London streets, that coronation-day,
79: When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,
80: That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,
81: That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!
82: KING RICHARD II: Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,
83: How went he under him?
84: Groom: So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.
85: KING RICHARD II: So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
86: That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;
87: This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.
88: Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,
89: Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck
90: Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
91: Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,
92: Since thou, created to be awed by man,
93: Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;
94: And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,
95: Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.
96: Keeper: Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.
97: KING RICHARD II: If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.
98: Groom: What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.
99: Keeper: My lord, will't please you to fall to?
100: KING RICHARD II: Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.
101: Keeper: My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who
102: lately came from the king, commands the contrary.
103: KING RICHARD II: The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!
104: Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.
105: Keeper: Help, help, help!
106: KING RICHARD II: How now! what means death in this rude assault?
107: Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.
108: Go thou, and fill another room in hell.
109: That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire
110: That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand
111: Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.
112: Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;
113: Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.
114: EXTON: As full of valour as of royal blood:
115: Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!
116: For now the devil, that told me I did well,
117: Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.
118: This dead king to the living king I'll bear
119: Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.
ACT 5 SCENE 6

1: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear
2: Is that the rebels have consumed with fire
3: Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;
4: But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.
5: Welcome, my lord what is the news?
6: NORTHUMBERLAND: First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.
7: The next news is, I have to London sent
8: The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent:
9: The manner of their taking may appear
10: At large discoursed in this paper here.
11: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;
12: And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.
13: LORD FITZWATER: My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London
14: The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,
15: Two of the dangerous consorted traitors
16: That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.
17: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;
18: Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.
19: HENRY PERCY: The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,
20: With clog of conscience and sour melancholy
21: Hath yielded up his body to the grave;
22: But here is Carlisle living, to abide
23: Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.
24: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Carlisle, this is your doom:
25: Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,
26: More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;
27: So as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:
28: For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,
29: High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.
30: EXTON: Great king, within this coffin I present
31: Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies
32: The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,
33: Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.
34: HENRY BOLINGBROKE: Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
35: A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
36: Upon my head and all this famous land.
37: EXTON: From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.
