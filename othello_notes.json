Whereupon Dr Johnson thus improved the occasion: All this learning, if it had even been what it endeavors to be thought, is, in this place, superfluous. There is no ground for supposing, that our author copied or knew the Greek phrase; nor does it follow, that, because a word has two senses in one language, the word which in another answers to one sense should answer to both. Afanus, in Latin, signifies both a hand and troop of soldiers, but we cannot say, that 'the captain marched at the head of his hand;' or, 'that he laid his troop upon his sword.' It is not always in books that the meaning is to be sought of this writer, who was much more acquainted with naked reason and with living manners. 'Double' has here its natural sense. The president of every deliberative assembly has a double voice. In our courts the chief justice and one of the inferior judges prevail over the other two.",

        "Pope: It should be unbonneting, i.e. without putting off the bonnet. THEOBALD: To speak 'unbonneted' is to speak with the cap off, which is directly opposite to the poet's meaning. So in Lear, III, i, 14, 'unbonneted he runs.' Othello means to say, that his birth and services set him upon such a rank that he may speak to a Senator of Venice with his hat on, i.e. without showing any marks of deference or inequality. I, therefore, am inclined to think Shakespeare wrote: 'May speak, and bonneted; &c. Or, if any like better the change of the negative un, in the corrupted reading, into the epistatic I’m, we may thus reform it: 'May speak unbonneted; &c. [This last conjecture was withdrawn by Theobald (ed. ii), but proposed anew by Steevens, without credit.] Johnson: Pope's emendation may as well be not putting on as not putting off, the bonnet. Steevens: Bonnier, says Cotgrave, is to put off one's cap. So in Cor. II, ii, 30. Mr Fuseli explains this passage as follows: ‘I am his equal or superior in rank; and were it not so, such are my demerits, that, unbonneted, without the addition of patrician or senatorial dignity, they may speak to as proud a fortune,' &c. 'At Venice the bonnet, as well as the tongue, is a badge of aristocratic honours to this day.' A. C. (in VarJ21): 'Unbonneted' is uncovered, revealed, made known. See a similar expression in II, iii, 'you unlace your reputation.' Coleridge [Notes, &c, p. 250): Theobald's argument goes on the assumption that Shakespeare could not use the same word differently in different places; whereas I should conclude, that as in the passage in Lear the word is employed in its direct meaning, so here it is used metaphorically; and this is confirmed by what has escaped the editors, that it is not 'I' but 'my demerits' that may speak 'unbonneted,'—without the symbol of a petitioning inferior. Staunton: The import we take to be,—my services when revealed [unbonneted) may aspire or lay claim to [may speak to) as proud a fortune as this which I have attained. Even with Fuseli's interpretation it is indispensable for the integrity of the passage that 'speak to' be understood in the sense just mentioned of aspire or lay claim to. Schmidt [Lex.): Perhaps the meaning is simply: I may say so with all courtesy and humility, and Othello's words must, perhaps, be accompanied by a corresponding gesture, as the writing of F seems to imply, by placing the word 'unbonnetted' in a parenthesis. White (ed. ii): The question of manners in Shakespeare's time as to the hat seems very difficult. The remembering courtesy, the off-capping, and the unbonneting are quite incongruous. No attempt to reconcile these expressions has been at all successful."

'Un housed' conveys to English ears no idea of anything which any one would be unwilling to resign; and, in fact, it is only by recollecting the way in which the Italians use Caesar that we arrive at its true meaning, which is unmarried. A soldier was as much 'unhoused,' in the ordinary meaning of the term, after marriage as before. Othello would not resign the freedom of his bachelor estate. Knight: Othello expresses no satisfaction at having been houseless, but he simply uses 'unhoused' for unmarried. The husband is the head or band of the house,—the unmarried is the unhorse-banded—the 'unhoused.'"

Steevens: As the gold ring annually thrown by the Doge into the Adriatic cannot be said to have much enriched it, I believe the common and obvious meaning of this passage is the true one. Pye: I think Steevens indubitably right, but not for the reason he gives. I believe Johnson thought no more of the Adriatic being enriched by the annual wedding-ring, than Shakespeare did of the Adriatic at all. [Steevens refers to the occurrence of the same phrase in D'Avenant's Cruel Brother (p. 131, ed. Maidment), and adds, 'perhaps the phrase is proverbial.' A citation from D'Avenant, in a case like this, carries but little weight. I doubt if there be an Act in all D'Avenant's plays, wherein Shakespearian phrases may not be found. For instance, the sixth line of this very play of The Cruel Brother reads: 'This way to madness leads,' and 'excellent wretch,' occurs more than once farther on. With more propriety Steevens refers to Wint. Tale, IV, iv, 501, and Hen. V: I, ii, 164; but is again far afield in referring to Pliny's Chapter (IX, 34) on The Riches of the Sea, which alludes to the high prices paid by luxury 'in furnishing the table with such varietie of dishes, in pleasing and contenting the taste with so many dainty and delicate fishes.' Conf. Rich. III: I, iv, 26: 'Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearls, Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea.'

Jahrbuch, xiv, 179): Shakespeare has not clearly distinguished between the Col- Ugio and the Senate. Brabantio's accusation of Othello could not have been brought before the Senate, but before the Ministerial Council—the Collegio. The Third Scene of the First Act is correctly laid in the 'Council Chamber,' not in the 'Hall of the Senate.' Properly also, Shakespeare speaks of 'the Council' and the 'Consuls,' that is, the Counsellors; but improperly in the same speech of the 'Senate' and [line 255] of the 'Senators.' But, perhaps, Shakespeare purposely avoided the use of the word College, because of its ambiguity to English ears."

He had not the hair particularly in his thoughts. Steevens: Shakespeare evidently alludes to the hair in 'the curled Anthony,' Ant. & Cleo. V, ii, 304. D'Avenant uses the same expression in his Just Italian [but as was said before, parallel expressions in D'Avenant are of small avail. Ed.] Malone: In R. of L., 981, the hair is expressly mentioned, and the epithet 'curled' is added as characteristic of a person of the highest rank: 'Let him have time to tear his curled hair.' [See notes in Lear, III, iv, 84, 'A Serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that curled my hair.'—Ed.]",

In Shakespeare's time dearling could never have been used as a plural. That even Spenser (who antiquated his language more than any of his contemporaries) did not venture to employ such an archaism, is proved by the following from his Hymne in honour of Love:— \"in a Paradize Of all delight, and ioyous happie rest, Where they doe feede on Nectar heauenly wize, With Hercules and Hebe, and the rest Of Venus dearlings, through her bountie blest.\""

I therefore read pageants, i.e. if we let such injurious actions go unpunished our statesmen must be slaves, ciphers in office, and have no power of redressing, be things of mere show and gaudy appearance only. Steevens: I believe the morality of either Christians or pagans was not in our author's thoughts. He alludes to the common condition of all blacks, who come from their own country both slaves and pagans; and uses the word in contempt of Othello and his complexion. If this Moor is now suffered to escape with impunity, it will be such an encouragment to his black countrymen, that we may expect to see all the first offices of our state filled up by the pagans and bondslaves of Africa.

Warburton says that Rymer ridicules this accusation of charms and medicines, but the passage in Rymer has escaped me, and small wonder, in that headlong torrent of amusing abuse of Shakespeare. Warburton, however, avails himself of the chance to cite a Venetian law, Dei maleficii et herbarie, cap. xvii, of the code, entitled ' Della promission del maleficio.' Whereupon Steevens remarks 'Though I believe Shakespeare knew no more of this Venetian law than I do, yet he was well acquainted with the edicts of that sapient prince King James the First.' 'But,' says Ritson (p. 228), 'there is no doubt that Shakespeare had the substance of Brabantio's speech from Cinthio's novel, however he might come by it; and Cinthio, it may be supposed, knew something of the Venetian Statute.' At this line and at line 80, Booth says, Cassio and Othello should exchange smiles, as at I, ii, 95."

Johnson: Whoever ridicules this account of the progress of love, shows his ignorance not only of history, but also of nature and manners.… It is no wonder that, in any age or in any nation, a lady recluse, timorous, and delicate—should desire to hear of events and scenes which she could never see; and should admire the man who had endured dangers and performed actions, which, however great, were yet magnified by her timidity."

Wherefore Theobald changed 'defunct' to distinct, and paraphrased the passage thus: 'I do not beg her company with me, merely to please myself; nor to indulge the heat and affects (i.e. affections) of a new-married man, in my own distinct and proper satisfaction, but to comply with her in her request and desire of accompanying me.' Shakespeare, he adds, uses 'affects' for affections in several other passages which are cited."

        "RANN: disjoined from those with which they are connected in sense, as to form a most lame and impotent conclusion; to say nothing of the awkwardness of using the word 'proper' without any possessive pronoun prefixed to it. All these difficulties are done away by retaining the original word 'my,' and reading disjunct, instead of 'defunct ;' and the meaning will be, 'I ask it not for the sake of my separate and private enjoyment, oy the gratification of appetite, but that I may indulge the wishes of my wife.'",
        "Rann (reading 'the young affect's In me defunct '): 'The tumult of such young desires is at my time of life considerably abated.' Rann here anticipates Gifford, who in his note on the passage in Massinger's Bondman, cited by Steevens, says: '\"Affects\" occurs incessantly in the sense of passions, affections: \"young affects\" are, therefore, perfectly synonymous with youthful heats. Othello was not an old man, though he had lost the fire of youth; the critics might, therefore, have dismissed that concern for the lady, which they have so delicately communicated for the edification of the rising generation. I would wish the future editors of Shakespeare to consider whether he might not have given affect in the singular (this also is used for passion) to correspond with heat.''",
        "Knight: 'Comply' may be used in the sense of supply, 'affects' are affections, and 'defunct' does not necessarily mean dead. Tyrwhitt considers that 'defunct' may be used in the Latin sense of perfor?Tied. As function has the same Latin root, we would suggest that Shakespeare used 'defunct' for functional, and then the meaning is clear: ' nor to gratify the young affections in my official and individual satisfaction.'",
        "Collier (ed. i): 'In my defunct and proper satisfaction' is merely 'in my own dead satisfaction' or gratification, the youthful passions or 'young affects' being comparatively 'defunct' in him. For the sense, though not for the harmony of the verse, it ought to have run 'for my proper and defunct satisfaction;' and had it so run, we doubt if so much ink would have been spilt and wasted upon it. It requires no proof that 'proper' was often used for own.",
        "Dyce [Remarks, p. 235) apprehends that 'few persons will be satisfied with Collier's explanation; nobody, assuredly, with Knight's,' and then cites the passage already given from Massinger's Bondman, together with one from Fletcher's Fair Maid of the Inn, I, i, first cited by Gifford, to show, as Gifford had already observed, how these lines of Shakespeare were understood by his contemporaries. 'They also show,' adds Dyce, 'that Upton's alteration of \"my\" to me is absolutely necessary.' Both Dyce and Gifford approve of Johnson's explanation.",
        "Collier (ed. ii) gives the lines as they are made to stand in his (MS), thus: ' Nor to comply wi' the young affects of heat (In me defunct) and proper satisfaction.'",
        "Jourdain [Trans. Fhilolog. Soc, i860, p. 139) is anticipated by Tyrwhitt in suggesting that the lines should be transposed, but asserts as 'his firm persuasion that 'defunct' is a misprint for default, meaning 'in my want of appearance, in my absence, and for my own satisfaction.' For the use of default in this sense Jourdain cites several examples.",
        "White (ed. i): Utterly unable either to explain this passage or to suggest in what particular it may be corrupted, I leave it exactly as it appears in the old copies. Of the page after page of comment which has been written upon it, and the several conjectural attempts which have been made to modify it into intelligibility, only Johnson's appears worthy of notice. That Shakespeare, although he may very probably have written 'comply with heat,' wrote 'comply with proper satisfaction,' I think almost impossible.",
        "Bailey (ii, 102) is dissatisfied with all that has been said about this passage, and asserts that nothing can be less felicitous than Johnson's text, wherein the parenthesis and the change of * my ' to ??ie combine 'to ruin the meaning of the speaker, which yet seems plain enough.' ' The epithet \" young \" does not refer, as is generally supposed, to young people or the young, but to the recency of his marriage.'",
        "Bailey proposes to read ' Nor to comply with heat of young affects.' ' Instead of merely \" heat,\" Wheat might be put with advantage and with the probability that it was the original reading. This slight emendation gives to the line clearness, precision, and propriety.' \"Defunct\" is used in its etymological sense to have done with, like \"defunctus laboribus\" of Horace, and by its use here Othello refers to the gratification of his moments of leisure and privacy, when he would be free from the duties of his office. Perhaps, to comprise the same meaning in another single epithet, we could not select a better than unofficial: \"In my unofficial and proper or personal satisfaction.\"'",
        "Keightley {Expositor, p. 300) after citing Upton's reading, asks: 'But can any one produce a single instance of Shakespeare's thus interposing a parenthesis between two substantives connected by a copula, or forming a sentence like that in the parenthesis? and what can be more rugged and disjointed than the whole passage as thus arranged? Would not the following not very violent corrections make the whole more Shakespearian and more harmonious? [See Textual Notes.] \"Distinct and proper \" means separate and peculiar. Distinct, the correction of \"defunct,\" I regard as nearly certain. Its meaning here is separate. \"Sheds stuff 'd with lambs and goats, distinctly kept, Distinct the biggest, the more mean distinct, Distinct the youngest.\"—Chapman, Odyss., ix, 34.'",
        "Daniel [Notes, &c, p. 77): Read: 'heat the young affects—In me defunct but for her satisfaction And to be,' &c.",
        "Hudson adopts this reading with the remark that it seems to him 'one of the happiest emendations ever made of the Poet's text. Nor can the changes be justly termed violent; as forher might easily get misprinted \"proper;\" and such transpositions as and and but are among the commonest of typographical errors.' Daniel interprets 'the young affects' as that 'which affects the young,' in which interpretation he follows Delius, who conceived himself justified therein by Malone, but over which Dyce lifts his hands in wonder at 'what Gifford would have thought if he had lived to read it.",
        "Rolfe: Othello only means that the early impetuosity of youthful passions is past—that he can control them, and is no longer controlled by them.",
        "White (ed. ii) The parenthetic passage is in a very doubtful condition. The confession put into Othello's mouth is the last that a lover would make, and on this occasion, especially after Desdemona's foregoing speech.",
        "Hudson: '\"Defunct\" properly goes with \"heat,\" not with \"affects.\" Othello means simply that the heat of youthful impulse has cooled down, that his passions have become tempered to the rule of judgement.' Hudson agrees with Bailey in thinking that 'with ' should be with the, regarding it as a case of absorption, as in 'Bring her to Try with Maine-course,' Temp. I, i; 'Let's all sink with King,' lb. [Cf. also 'Holds such an enmity with blood of man,' Ham. I, v, 65, and Allen's note in Rom. 6° Jul., p. 429.] Hudson adds, 'that to \"comply with one's own satisfaction\" is not and never was English, as it seems to me.' [Is not this the speech to be expected from Othello after what Desdemona had just said? As there was no alloy of passion in her love for him whose visage she saw in his mind, and to whose honours she had consecrated her soul, so Othello proclaimed that it was for the nobler intercourse of marriage that he wanted Desdemona to accompany him, to be free and bounteous to her mind, not to please the palate of his appetite; and in saying this, he wishes as delicately as possible to intimate that the 'compulsive ardour of ' flaming youth,' as Hamlet calls it, was over for him. This, I think, is the idea which, if we heard the speech on the stage only, we should all gather from it, nor do the various emendations and changes convey any very different meaning. Here then, I think, we may rest. The object of the speaker is attained; he has given us his meaning. As a mere intellectual amusement we may inquire into the passage more curiously, and rearrange the puzzle while retaining the sense; the pleasure and the profit will, by the exercise, accrue to ourselves alone, with but little likelihood of ever heading, except in imagination, a band of converts. Moreover, in the inexplicable passages in Shakespeare, like 'the runaway's eyes,' 'the dram of eale,' 'Vllorxa,' the present passage, and others, after the printers have borne all the obloquy which we can heap upon them, might we not frown a little at Shakespeare himself? He must have written rapidly. Would his fame be seriously impaired or stabbed to the centre, if we cautiously whispered among ourselves that he now and then wrote carelessly?—Ed.]"

        "Harting (p. 69): 'Seeling,' consisted in sewing a thread through the upper and under eyelids of a newly-caught hawk to obscure the sight for a time, and accustom her to the hood. Turbervile, in his Booh of Falconrie, 1575, gives the following directions 'how to seele a hawke': 'Take a needle threeded with untwisted thread, and (casting your Hawke) take her by the beake and put the needle through her eye-lidde, not right against the sight of the eye, but somewhat nearer to the beake, because she may see backwards. And you must take good heede that you hurt not the webbe, which is under the eye-lidde, or on the inside thereof. Then put youi needle also through that other eye-lidde, drawing the endes of the thread together, tye them over the beake not with a straight knotte, but cut off the threedes endes neare to the knotte and twist them together in such sorte, that the eye-liddes may be raysed so upwards, that the Hawke may not see at all, and when the threed shall ware loose or untyed, then the Hawke may see somewhat backwardes, which is the cause that the threed is put nearer to the beake. For a Sparrow-hawke should see somewhat backwardes, and a Falcon forwardes. The reas5 is that if the Sparrow-hawke should see forwardes, shee would beat off her feathers or break them when she bateth upon the fist, and seeing the companie of men, or such like, she would bate too much.' Sir Emerson Tennant {Sketches of the Nat. Hist, of Ceylon, p. 246), says: 'Where it [the goshawk] is trained for hawking, it is usual, in lieu of a hood, to darken its eyes by means of a silken thread passed through holes in the eyelids.' This practice of 'seeling,' has happily given way to a great extent to the more merciful use of the hood. [See post, III, iii, 242; also notes on 'seeling night,' Alacb. Ill, ii, 46. Ed.] Wright [Bible Word-Book, s. v. Cieled): The etymology of this word is obscured by the spelling, which seems to connect it with the Fr. ciel, It. cielo, ' a canopy.' To seel or seele a room was to cover it with boards, or wainscotting, like Fr. plancher. To seel the eyes of a hawk or dove (Fr. siller les yeux) was to sew up their eyelids. 'What we now call the ceiling was formerly called the upper-seeling, Fr. sus-lambris, to distinguish it from the seeling or wainscotting on the walls.'—Wedgwood, Diet."

        "Malone: 'Speculative instruments,' in Shakespeare's language, are the eyes, and 'active instruments,' the hands and feet. As ' seel ' is here metaphorically used, it applies very properly to the ' speculative instruments;' but foils, of the Qq, agrees better with 'active instruments.' Knight: The modern editors have made up a text between the Qto and Ff. They reject the foils of the Qto, and adopt the 'seel ' of the Ff, while they substitute the active of the Qto for the 'offic'd ' of the Ff. Having accomplished this hocus-pocus, they tell us that speculative instruments are the eyes, and active instruments the hands and feet; that to ' seel ' is to close the eyelids of a bird, which applies very properly to the speculative instruments, but that foils better suits the active. It is their own work they are quarrelling with, and not that of the author. Either reading is good, if they had let it alone. The speculative and active instruments, which are foiled, are the thoughts and the senses; the speculative and offic'd instrument, which is seeled, is the whole man in meditation and in action. When the poet adopted the more expressive word seel, he did not leave the ugly anomaly which the commentators have made. He took the whole man as an instrument, spiritual and material, and metaphorically seeled the perceptions of that instrument. [Cf. 'no speculation in those eyes,' Macb. Ill, iv, 95.]"

Steevens: The meaning is, if virtue comprehends everything in itself, then your virtuous son-in-law is, of course, beautiful; he has that beauty which delights every one. 'Delighted' for delighting, Shakespeare often uses the active and passive participles indiscriminately. The same sentiment occurs in Twelfth Night, III, iv, 403. Tyrwhitt: 'Delighted' is used for delighting ox delightful in Cymo. V, iv, 102. [In illustration of 'the delighted spirit' in Meas. for Meas. Ill, i, Ritson cites from Sir Thos. Herbert's Relation of Some Years Travels, &c, 1634, p. 104: 'Mirza .... gave a period to his miseries in this world by supping a delighted cup of extreame poyson,' which Walker (Crit., ii, 11) interprets as meaning rendered delicious by the admixture of certain ingredients. Thereupon Walker queries if 'delighted' be not used here in Othello nearly as in Herbert—that is, endowed with delights, deliciis exornata. Delius adopts this interpre* tation, and it is to me also eminently satisfactory both here and in Meas. for Meas.; 'If virtue lacks not beauty that is endowed with every delightsome quality, Then,' &c. Ed.] 323-325: Coleridge (Notes, &c, 251): In real life, how da we look back to little speeches as presentimental of, or contrasted with, an affecting event? Even so, Shakespeare, as secure of being read over and over, of becoming a family friend, provides this passage for his readers and leaves it to them."

        "Malone: From this, Iago's age may be ascertained; and it corresponds with the account in the novel on which Othello is founded, where he is described as a young, handsome man. [Le Tourneur having said in his translation: Jago pouvoit avoir environ quarante ans; les annees qu'il compte sont celles de l'experience, Malone replies:] that Iago meant to say he was but twenty-eight years old is clearly ascertained by his marking particularly, though indefinitely, a period within that time [' and since I could distinguish,' &c] when he began to make observations on the characters of men. Verplanck: The actors who have been most celebrated in the part, from Quin to Cooke, are understood to have represented Iago as at least a middle-aged man. Yet the incident of Iago's youth seems to add much to the individuality and intensity of the character. An old soldier of acknowledged merit, who, after years of service, see^ a young man like Cassio placed over his head, has not a little to plead in justification of deep resentment, and in excuse, though not in defence, of his revenge; such a man may well brood over imaginary wrongs. The caustic sarcasm and contemptuous estimate of mankind are, at least, pardonable in a soured and disappointed veteran. But in a young man the revenge is more purely gratuitous, the hypocrisy, the knowledge, and dexterous management of the worst and weakest parts of human nature, the recklessness of moral feeling,—even the stern, bitter wit, intellectual and contemptuous, without any of the gayety of youth,—are all precocious and peculiar; separating Iago from the ordinary sympathies of our nature, and investing him with higher talent and blacker guilt. Cowden-Clarke: It is remarkable that Shakespeare has here taken pains to specify the exact age of Iago, as he has specified that of Hamlet. They are, perhaps, the two most intellectual characters that our poet has drawn; and he has made them nearly of the same age, as if at that period of life a man's intellect were at the culminating point of activity and energy Iag° is a hard, cold-blooded, almost vivacious scoundrel from inherent disposition, who uses his keen intellect with the )ame fierce joy in its skill and power to destroy that he uses his sharp dagger or sword. Hudson (Introd., p. 22): Moreover Iago's youth goes far to explain the trust which othi.rs repose in him; they cannot suspect one so young of being either skilled in villainous craft or soured by hard experience of the world; while his polished manners and winning address gain him the credit of superior parts, without breeding any question of his truth."

And then comes the last sentiment: 'Our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that you call—love to be a sect or scion!' Here is the true Iagoism of, alas! how many! Note Iago's pride of mastery in the repetition of 'Go, make money!' to his anticipated dupe, even stronger than his love of lucre; and when Roderigo is completely won—'I am chang'd. I'll go sell all my land,' when the effect has been fully produced, the repetition of triumph—'Go to; farewell; put money enough in your purse!'"

In many parts of England the young shoots are boiled and much relished as food, and M. Soyer tried hard, but almost in vain, to introduce it as a most dainty dish. In other points the nettle is a most interesting plant. Microscopists find in it most beautiful objects; entomologists value it as a favourite of butterflies and other insects, of which in Britain alone upwards of thirty varieties feed solely on the nettle-plant, and it marks the progress of civilization by following man wherever he goes. But as a garden plant the only advice to be given is to keep it out of the garden by every means, where, if allowed, it would soon become a sad weed."

It is now very little cultivated it has not much beauty, and its medicinal properties are not much esteemed; yet it will always have an interest to readers of the Bible, though whether or not the hyssop of Scripture is the Hyssopus offic. is still a question. It seems likely from the following passage in Lyly's Euphues, that the plants were not named at random by Iago: 'Good gardeiners, in their curious knots, mixe Hisoppe with Time, as ayders the one to the growth of the other; the one beeing drye, the other moyst ' [p. 37, ed. Arber].",

Thyme is the Anglicized form of the Greek and Latin Thymum, which it probably received from its use as incense in sacrifices; while its other name, serpyllum, refers to its creeping habit. It is another curious point connected with the name that thymum does not occur in the old English vocabularies. Nor is even its Latin form found, except in the Prompt. Parv., where it is ' Tyme, herbe, Tima, timum—Tyme, flowre, Titnus? It is thus a puzzle to know how it can have got naturalized among us, for in .Shakespeare's time it was completely naturalized. It is as a bee-plant especially that the thyme has always been celebrated. See Ovid's Fasti, v; Vergil, Eel. vii. The wild thyme can be scarcely considered a garden plant, except in its variegated and golden varieties; but if it ever should come naturally in the turf, it should be welcomed and cherished for its sweet scent."

        "Bucknill [The Medical Knowledge of Shakespeare, p. 270): This word, which with a degree of probability not more overstrained than that which attributes to Shakespeare the knowledge of Harvey's great discovery, by a literal reading would lead to the conclusion that he had anticipated Linnoeus's theory of the sexes of plants. No other author I know of uses the word 'gender' in any other sense than to mark the attributes of sex; while he himself uses it in this sense in several passages, 'the 1 imbers of the genders,' Merry Wives, IV, i, 73. But he also uses it to designate a kind or species, as 'the great love the general gender bear him,' Ham. IV, vii, 18. It is probable, therefore, that it is in this sense the word is used by Iago, and that Shakespeare had not necessarily any idea of the sexual physiology of plants which the great Swedish naturalist developed into a system; and thus also when he refers, in other places, to the sex of plants, that it is merely a poetical metaphor."

To the poet himself all the succeeding events must have been clear and determined; but to bring himself again into the situation of one who sees them in embryo, to draw a mist over that which he had already cleared, must have required an exertion of genius peculiar to this author alone. In so lively a manner does he make Iago show his perplexity about the future management of his conduct, that one is almost tempted to think that the poet had determined as little himself about some of the particulars of Iago's destruction."

        "Theobald: In adopting the Qq, Pope evidently supposed that 'mountains' here referred not to water, but, to land; Theobald showed that Shakespeare refers to 'hills of seas' in this very Scene, line 215, and 'liquid mountains' in Tro. & Cress., and that he had abundance of classical authority for the simile, in Homer, and Vergil and Ovid; and that therefore 'mountains' here refers to waves. Despite this clear exposition, JENNENS, the sturdy follower of Qx , thinks that the sense seems to require either Pope's text or his own, both founded on the Qto. In the mes It of Qx he sees, correctly, a typographical error for melts, and thus interprets the passage: ' If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea as here at land, where the huge mountain melts away before the storm, what ribs of oak can hold the mortise? Theobald did not consider the impropriety of waves melting; clouds have been said to melt indeed, but never waves that I remember. I don't doubt that Shakespeare had the following passage of Scripture in his eye, \" The mountains melt at the presence of the Lord,\" &c.'"

[Both Dyce and Schmidt give to this word in this passage the meaning of 'to sound, to resound, to echo' and 'to be noisy about,' and they refer in support to the Qto. But this definition contains, it seems to me, but a small share of the full definition of 'chidden.' I have searched in vain for a passage in Shakespeare where 'to chide' has the meaning to sound, and that meaning alone; in every instance there is, it seems to me, the essential idea of scolding, brawling, contention in all degrees, from 'chiding as loud as thunder' to 'the sweet chiding of well-tuned sounds.' The 'gallant chiding' which Hippolyta [Mid. Ar . D. IV, i, 120] heard when Hercules and Cadmus bayed the bear in a wood in Crete, applies, I think, to the hunters scolding, urging on, the hounds; which Hippolyta afterward calls a 'musical discord;' the 'discord' was the brawling of the hunters, the hounds, their followers, and the bear; the 'music' was the softened echoes of it all from ' the skies, the fountains, every region near.' The essential idea of 'chiding' is there not merely 'sound.' The 'chiding nativity' of Marina {.Per. Ill, i, 32) was the rude, brawling welcome to the world given tc her by the contest of ' fire, air, water earth, and Heaven.' Ed.]"

The main is the ocean. Substitute that word, and what can we make of the passage before us ? ' the wind-shak'd surge with high and monstrous ocean.' But adopt the word mane, and it appears to us we have as fine an image as any in Shakespeare. It is more striking even than the passage in Hen. IV. 1—the winds, Who take the ruffian billows by the top, Curling their monstrous heads.' In the high and monstrous mane we have a picture which was probably suggested by the noble passage in Job : ' Hast thou given the horse strength ? Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?' One of the biblical commentators upon this passage remarks, that Homer and Vergil mention the mane of the horse; but that the sacred author, by the bold figure of thunder, expresses the shaking of the mane, and the flakes of hair which suggest the idea of lightning. The horse of Job is the war-horse, ' who swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage ;' and when Shakespeare pictured to himself his mane wildly streaming, 'when the quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield,' he saw an image of the fury of the ' wind-shak'd surge,' and of its very form; and he painted it with 'high and monstrous mane.'"

        "Johnson: Alluding to the star Arctophylax. Steevens: I wonder that none of the advocates of Shakespeare's learning have observed that Arctophylax literally signifies 'the guard of the Bear.' J. F. Marsh (A 7 \". 6° Qu., 1877, 5th, viii, 83): Both Johnson and Steevens are in error; and Shakespeare knew better than his commentators what he was talking about when he spoke of the guards of the pole, and not of the guard of the Bear. Arctophylax is not a synonym for the star Arcturus, but for the constellation Bootes; and the Bear, of which he is the guard, or rather keeper, is not the Little Bear, of which Polaris is the lucida, but the Great Bear, as will be evident in the most cursory glance at a celestial globe. Arctophylax, whether it mean the star or the constellation, has no connection with the Polar guards. They are the two stars /3 and y Ursae Minoris, on the shoulder and foreleg of the Little Bear, as usually depicted, or sometimes on the ear and shoulder. They were more observed in Shakespeare's time than now for the purposes of navigation. Norman's Safeguard of Sailers, 1 587, has a chapter, ' Howe to knowe the houre of the night by the Guards,' &c. They were even made the subject of mechanical contrivances for facilitating calculation, one of which is described in The Arte of Navigation, trans, by Richard Eden from the Spanish of Martin Curtis (or Cortez), 1561, consisting of fixed and movable concentric circles with holes, through which to observe 'the two starres called the Guardians, or the mouth of the home.' Further details will be found in Admiral Smyth's Cycle of Celestial Objects, ii, 331, where is also cited Tap's Seaman's Grammar, 1609, 'containing still more upon the Guards;' and Hood's Use of the Celestial Globe, 1590, deriving the name 'from the Spanish word guardare, which is to beholde, because they are diligently to be looked unto, in regard of the singular use which they have in navigation.' Shakespeare probably meant to include in the Guards all the three stars [i.e. /3 and y Ursae Minoris, and Polaris] required for the observations above noticed. Otherwise in describing a tempest which seemed to cast water on one constellation, and quench two of the principal stars of another, he could scarcely have avoided mentioning the third star, the brightest and most important of the three."

        "Theobald, by simply altering the punctuation, was the first to make this refer to the ship and not to Cassio, ' who was no Veronese,' says Theobald in his ed. i; ' but we find from other passages in the play he was of Rome ' (withdrawn in ed. ii). 'The vessel properly belonged to Verona, but was in the service of Venice.' Heath: Shakespeare had no ship in his thoughts, but intended to inform us that Cassio was of Verona, an inland city of the Venetian State. The word Veronese should be pronounced after the Italian manner as a quadrisyllable. T. Warton: It was common to introduce Italian words, and in their proper pronunciation then familiar; see Faerie Queene, III, xii, 90: 'And sleeues dependant Albanese-wyse? The ship was a Veronese, just as we now say a Hamburgher. Cassio was a Florentine. In this speech the Third Gentleman, who brings the news of the wreck of the Turkish fleet, returns to the tale, and tells the circumstances more distinctly. In his former speech he speaks of ' a noble ship of Venice,' and now he adds: ' The very ship is just now put into port, and she is a VeroneseV That is, a ship fitted out or furnished by the people of Verona, a city of the Venetian State. Steevens: I believe we are all wrong. Verona is an inland city. Every inconsistency may, however, be avoided if we read The Veronessa, i. e. the name of the ship is the Veronessa. [While all the critics thus far had stated that Verona was tributary to Venice, yet, having cited no authority, they had apparently drawn the fact from the depths of their consciousness it was reserved for Malone to justify the assertion in a note, which is the only one from the mass that Dyce quotes, as follows :] ' Besides many other towns (says Contareno), castles, and villages, they [the Venetians] possess seven faire cities ; as Trevigi, Padoua, Vicenza, Verona, Brescia, Bergamo, and Crema.' Commonwealth of Venice, 1599. Knight retains the Veronessa, because 'as a feminine it is applicable to a ship.' Collier: The Third Gentleman has already said that the ship was ' of Venice,' and it is not likely that he would assert just afterwards that she was a 'Veronese;' it seems much more probable that he would by mistake call Cassio, whom he did not know, a ' Veronese.' Singer: Whether a Veronessa signified a ship fitted out by Verona, or designated some particular kind of vessel, is not yet fully established. But as it has not hitherto been met with elsewhere, the former is most probably the true explanation. White (ed. i): There is difficulty in either reading; but of the two errors, one of which it is necessary to suppose on Shakespeare's part, a momertary forgetfulness appears the more probable. Keightley {Exp., 301): Another instance of the poet's negligence or forgetfulness Though the metre is perfect, it might be better to insert nam\" J or one. It is not likely that the ship was called 'the Veronessa? Daniel (p. 78): Read: 'The ship is here r»ut in, | \" La Veronesa:\" Michael Cassio, | Lieutenant,' &c. Hudson adopts Daniel's suggestion. Rolfe agrees with White that the confusion is perhaps due to a momentary forgetfulness on Shakespeare's part. Til. ELZE (Sh. Jahrbuch, xiv, 1 76): The word is clearly corrupt, but F x puts us on the right track. Let the true word be ' verrinessa,' and the changes, due to editorial lack of knowledge, through ' verennessa ' and * Veronessa ' to ' Veronese ' are easily understood. Now although I cannot at the moment give an Italian authority for the noun ' verinessa,' yet there is the word ' verrina ' and the verb ' verrinare,' which is an old nautical term and still in use, equivalent in meaning to tenebrare, perforare, traforare, that is, to ' cut through,' to ' cleave,' like the French percer. Wherefore the • noble ship of Venice ' was a verrinessa, * un perceflot.' [Is not this the exact equivalent of the nautical term ' cutter ' ? If only an instance of the use of the Italian word could be produced, this vexed question would be settled for ever. As it is, Th. Elze's explanation seems far more satisfactory than any other ; but if a supersubtle compositor forces us to choose between a lack of memory on Shakespeare's part and a lack of geographical information, I prefer the latter. The nationality of a chance ship, mentioned once and never again, is of less moment than the nationality of an important •cnaracter ; the same wind that can blow a ship to Aleppo can waft one from Verona. Furthermore, how in the wild excitement of the moment could the Third Gentleman find out from what city of Italy Cassio came ? That he was the lieutenant to the warlike Moor might be revealed at a glance by some distinctive decoration of his dress, such as the scarf of company, which always bore the Captain's colours. Ed."

      "notes": [
        "Johnson: I do not understand these lines. I know not how hope can be surfeited to death, that is, can be increased, till it be destroyed; nor what it is, 'to stand in bold cure;' or why hope should be considered a disease. Shall we read: ‘Therefore my fears, not surfeited to death’ ? &c. This is better, but it is not well. Shall we strike a bolder stroke, and read thus: 'Therefore my hopes, not forfeited to death, Stand bold, not sure' ? Jennens: Wishes may be called the food upon which hope is very apt to surfeit ; and to surfeit to death too, when there is no ground or foundation to expect the thing hoped for. Hope is in perfect health where the grounds for it are equal to the wish ; but if the wish preponderate the grounds of expectation, hope is in a sickly state. This was the case with Cassio ; his wishes for Othello's safety were greater than the probability of it, for he had left him on a dangerous sea ; so his hope was sick ; but not sick to death, because the ship had a good pilot ; this thought physicked hope, and put it in a bold state of cure. Steevens: Presumptuous hopes, which have no foundation in probability, may poetically be said to surfeit themselves to death, or forward their own dissolution. 'In bold cure' means in confidence of being cured. Malone: It is not hope which is here described as the disease ; those misgiving apprehensions which diminish hope are, in fact, the disease, and hope itself is the patient. Henley: I believe that Solomon upon this occasion will be found the best interpreter: 'Hope deferred maketh the heart sick.' Knight: Hope upon hope, without realization, is- a surfeit of hope and extinguishes hope. Cassio had some reasonable facts to prevent his hope being 'surfeited to death.' Collier: The meaning seems to be, that Cassio's hopes are not destroyed by constant repetition and disappointment. Singer: Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death by excess of apprehension, stand in confidence of being cured. Staunton (Note on Ant. & Cleo. II, i, 38): As in our early language to expect most commonly meant to stay or wait, so to hope on some occasions was used where we should now adopt to expect. (Note on present passage): 'Hopes' here are expectations or presentiments. Cowden-Clarke: My hopes, not having been utterly destroyed by reiterated false excitement and successive defeat, remain in confident expectation of being fulfilled. Hudson: Cassio, though anxious, does not despair; and the meaning of ‘stand in bold cure’ seems to be, ‘my hopes, though near dying, stay themselves upon, or are kept alive by, bold conjecture;’ or, it may be, ‘are confident of being cured.’ I was for a while in doubt whether to read ‘not suffocate to death’ or ‘not sick yet unto death;’ but on the whole preferred the former as involving somewhat less of change, and as being perhaps rather more in Shakespeare's manner. D'Hugues: Il est clair cependant que les esperances s'ajoutant aux esperances, sans etre jamais realisees, constituent un trop plein (surfeit) d'esperances, qui fait evanouir toute esperance. C'est la meme chose que Moliere a voulu dire dans le fameux sonnet d'Oronte : Belle Philis, on desespere Alors qu'on espere toujours. [These paraphrases are all of them intelligible, and would be entirely satisfactory could we only forget the text, which as it now stands is unintelligible to me, and I am willing to ' say ditto to' Dr. Johnson.

        "Warburton: It is plain that something very hyperbolical was here intended. But what is there as it stands? Why this, that in the essence of creation she bore all excellency. The expression is intolerable, and could never come from one who so well understood the force of words as our Poet. The essential vesture is the same as essential form. So that the expression is nonsense. For the vesture of creation signifies the forms in which created beings are cast. And essence relates not to the form, but to the matter. Shakespeare certainly wrote: 'And in terrestrial vesture,' &c. And in this lay the wonder, that all created excellence should be contained within an earthly mortal form. Heath (p. 559): I entirely agree with Warburton that the common reading is indefensible I should rather suspect that the poet wrote 'And in the sensual vesture,' &c. The sense is, And within that vesture of the human senses with which she is clothed by the Creator she is endued with every excellency. Johnson: I do not think ' essential ' inexplicable; it seems to be used for existent, real. She excels the praises of invention says he, and in real qualities with which creation has invested her bears all excellency. I explain thus: Does tire the ingenious verse. This is the best reading, and that which the author substituted in his revisal."

Schmidt in his admirable translation thus renders this line: 'Er stand in eines guten Engels Schutz,' and pleads for it thus: If we consider the meaning of this line in connection with what follows it is evident that there must be some reference to Desdemona. ' Speed' in Shakespeare means not only swiftness, haste, but success, fortune, and also that propitious power, or exalted guardianship, which brings success, especially in the expression of good wishes. ' Saint Nicholas be thy speed !' Two Gent. Ill, i, 301; ' Hercules be thy speed,' As You Like It, I, ii, 222, and elsewhere; and with a comic turn in 'good manners be your speed,' 1 Hen. IV: III, i, 190. Hence, therefore, Desdemona is here the guardian angel who saves Iago's ship, and at the conclusion of the speech she is styled not without a purpose, ' the divine Desdemona.'"

Steevens: Perhaps escerped was an old English word borrowed from the French, escarps, which Shakespeare, not finding congruous to the image of clogging the keel, afterwards changed. I once thought it might be Traitors enscarfd, i.e. muffled in their robes, as in Jul. Cats, or Ham., ' My sea-gown scarfd about me.' Henley: Steevens's difficulty would, perhaps, have been removed had he recollected Othello's speech in IV, ii, 60: ' Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips.' Boswell: Traitors ensteep'd are merely traitors concealed under the water. Knight: Rocks and sand are beneath the water, and what is beneath the water is steep'd in the water. The identical word thus applied is in the Faerit Queene, I, xi, 276: ' Now gan the goldei Phoebus for to steepe His fierie face in billowes of the west.' White (ed i) reads enscarfd and upholds the word: because Shakespeare never uses ' steep' in the sense of ' plunge' or ' submerge,' but always in that of ' lave' or ' soak,' which is almost ridiculously inappropriate here; because 'scarp' in Shakespeare's day meanl the inner slope of a ditch or intrenchment, then as now descriptive of shelving rocks: and because enscarped might be easily mistaken for ' ensteeped,' owing to the likeness between c and t in the MS. of the early seventeenth century. Dyce in his ed. ii reminded White of Henley's reference to IV, ii, 60, and White adopted ' ensteep'd ' in his ed. ii, and enscarfd was heard of no more."

Malone: How does it appear that this book was written several years before its publication, from the circumstances mentioned ? Puttenham does not speak of Sir Nicholas Bacon as living ; but speaks of those that knew him; from which we might rather infer that it could not be written before 1578, when that lord keeper died."

Had I not met with the word thus fantastically applied, I should have concluded that Othello called his wife a ' warrior ' because she had embarked with him on a warlike expedition, and not in consequence of Ovid's observation: ' Militat omnis amans, et habet sua castra Cupido.' [Southern was not born until nigh a half century after Shakespeare's death. Steevens' s reading was so extensive, his memory so tenacious, and his wit so ready, that we shall always owe him gratitude for his labours, and ought not to ' mock his useful toil ' if now and then he wanders far, very far, afield. Desdemona had protested that she could not stay at home a 'moth of peace,' but must go to 'the War' with Othello; and to that, I think, is the allusion here. Ed.]."

        "Warburton: 'A trifling insignificant fellow may perhaps be called Trash, but the metaphor of hunting is not preserved. I suppose therefore that the word is brack, which is a low species of hounds of the chase, and a term generally used in contempt. As to \" trace,\" crush of Qx is plainly a corruption of cherish? Warton was the first to suggest that trash should be substituted for 'trace,' but he was not strictly accurate in his definition of its technical meaning ; he supposed that it meant simply to rate, to check, and cited Caratach's reply to Nennius (Bonduca, I, i) when Nennius taunted him with flying from the Romans: 'I fled too ; But not so fast,—your jewel had been lost then, Young Hengo there ; he trashV me,' i. e., says Warton, he stopped me. At last Steevens (1793) discovered the meaning of trash which has since been generally accepted. 'To trash is still a hunter's phrase, and signifies to fasten a weight on the neck of a dog, when his speed is superior to that of his companions \" Trash \" in the first instance in this line may be used to signify a worthless hound, as the same term is afterwards employed to describe a worthless female: \"I do suspect this trash\" (V, i, 108). It is scarcely necessary to support the present jingle on the word, it is so much in our author's manner, although his worst.' Knight upholds ' trace,' but was misled in his interpretation. ' Trash ' and ' trace,' says Knight, 'are used with perfect propriety. The \"trash\" is the thing traced, put in traces—confined—as an untrained worthless dog is held, and hence the present meaning of trask.' Dyce (Remarks, p. 237): Knight's explanation of 'trash' is borrowed from Richardson's Diet., where we find: ' A trash—anything (man, dog) trashed or traced or confined in traces, that it may not, because it would, run or pursue too fast, rashly ; like an untrained dog ; a worthless hound; hence it is anything worthless,' &c. But in this explanation Richardson is undoubtedly mistaken ; he gives to trash a meaning which it never did and never could bear. When used as a huntsman vr dog-trainer's term, or metaphorically with an allusion to their practices, it invariably signifies the thing WHICH RESTRAINS: 'Above this lower roome shall be your huntsmans lodging, wherin hee shall also keep his cooples, liams, collars, trashes, boxes,' •Sec.—Markham's Conntrey Contentments, b. i. c., i, p. 15, 1615. The trash, whether a strap, a rope dragging loose on the ground, or a weight, was fastened round the neck of a too forward dog, to check his movements. Collier (ed. ii) in justification of his (MS.) says that 'trash and trace were used somewhat synonymously, as a mode of keeping back braches, i. e. dogs, who hunted too quickly. Iago speaks of Roderigo as a poor hound, who was so eager in the chase that it was necessary to restrain him.' Singer (ed. ii) thinks that Warburton's brach is correct, and that crush is a misprint for trash. * The converse has happened in the Ind. to the Tarn, cf Shr., where brach has been misprinted trash.* Roderigo is cheeked or trashed by Iago for his quick hunting ; i. e. he is in too great a hurry to come to an explanation with Desdemona.' White (ed. i): 'Whom I trash,' i. e. whom I restrain, whip in. ' Trace ' seems to have been only a varied form of trash. The misprint in the Qto is evidently due to the likeness of c and l. Staunton cannot subscribe to Warburton's emendation brach, 'although persuaded that \" trash of Venice\" is a vitiation of what the poet wrote. Trash signifying to clog, to impede, is surely the genuine word for \" trace \" of the Folio.' Bailey (ii, 108): It is plain to me that the genuine reading is leash, i. e. whom I hold in leash for the quick hunting of the Moor. Keightley [Exp. 302): ' The jingle,' Steevens says, ' being in Shakespeare's manner.' Now to this I object first, that this was not Shakespeare's manner, for the apparent instances of it are mostly printers' blunders ; and, secondly, that Roderigo did not require to be trashed or checked ' for his quick hunting,' for he was always hanging back and ready to give up the chase till urged on by Iago. This last objection also applies to ' trace ' in the sense of follow or accompany. It would apply also, though in a less degree, to train, which would yield a tolerable sense. On the whole, I think that Iago's words may have been praise, which would suit his sneering, ironical tone. As to brach, though we frequently find it used of a woman, I believe it was never applied to a man. Dyce (ed. iii): I give the reading of Steevens, but I now (1865) entertain great doubts if it be what Shakespeare wrote. [I have reserved Halliwell's note for the last, because it gives what seems to me to be the true interpretation ; the Folio needs no change ; « trace ' bears here one of its commonest meanings ; ' For his quick hunting ' does not mean, because of his quick hunting' but in order to make him, for the purpose of making him, hunt quickly, a meaning of 'for' which White (ed. ii) especially notes, and, thus noting it, it is strange that White should have missed the common meaning of the word ' trace.' Ii was Steevens who gave a bias to the word from which it never recovered until Halli well set it straight, whose note is as follows : ' The meaning seems to be—if this wietched fellow, whose steps I carefully watch in order to quicken his pace, follows my directions, I will have our Michael Cassio on the hip.'

        "He dies] Malone: The editor of the Folio, thinking it necessary to omit the first word of the line, absurdly supplied its place by adding these words at the end of the line. Tollet: Montano thinks he is mortally wounded, yet by these words he seems determined to continue the duel and to kill his antagonist, Cassio. So, when Roderigo runs at Cassio in Act V, he says: 'Villain, thou diest.' Steevens: That is, he shall die. He may be supposed to say this as he is offering to renew the fight. Thus, Othello in his very next speech: 'he dies upon his motion.' I do not therefore regard these words, when uttered by Montano, as an absurd addition in F. Knight and Delius give the same explanation as Toilet's. Collier: These words are, in fact, nothing more than a printer's blunder, which F2 corrects by making Montano say, 'I am hurt, but not to the death.' The true stage direction, for which 'He dies' was, no doubt, intended, is found in Q2, 'He faints.' [It is not easy here to decide between the rival claims. As stage directions there are objections both to 'He dies' and 'He faints.' Assuredly Montano does not die; and it is difficult to see with what propriety a man who had fainted could be adjured to stop fighting, both by Othello and Iago. If these words be not a stage direction, but a part of the text, there is to Toilet's interpretation this objection, viz.: that Montano was acting throughout in self-defence, as he himself tells Othello, line 227, which he would have scarcely presumed to assert had he renewed the attack with such bitterness before Othello's very eyes. This is one of the passages, I think, where it will not do to inquire too closely. The dramatic action demands a barbarous brawl, in which Montano shall be worsted, and latitude is given to the actors to portray the extent of his discomfiture. I am not sure that Cowden-Clarke's course of omitting the words altogether be not the wisest. Ed.]"

        "Quarter] Johnson: In their quarters; at their lodging. Malone: That is, on our station. So in Timon, V, iv, 60: ‘not a man Shall pass his quarter.’ Their station or 'quarter' in the present instance was the guardroom in Othello's castle. It cannot mean lodgings, for Montano and the Gentlemen had continued, from the time of their entrance, in the apartment of Othello's castle, in which the carousal had been and Cassio had only gone forth for a short time to set the watch. On his return from the platform to the apartment he meets Roderigo, and the scuffle ensues. Ritson (p. 230): Rather, at peace, quiet, or, as Johnson elsewhere explains it, 'in friendship, amity, concord.' They had been on that very spot (the court or platform before the castle) ever since Othello left them, which can scarcely be called being in their quarters or at their lodging. And, indeed, they could not have left it without being guilty of another offence, as they were directed by Othello to keep the watch. Henley denies that the phrase ever meant in quiet, at peace; it is evident, he says, that the 'quarter' referred to was that apartment of the castle assigned to the officers on guard, where Othello, after giving Cassio his orders, had, a little before, left him; and where Iago, with his companions, immediately found him. Pye (p. 331): This word, in the military language of the present day at least, seems to have no very precise meaning; but the meaning on our station seems the leading signification, for the principal camp-guard of a regiment is called the quarter guard; but a regiment in quarters has no such guard."

        "collied] Steevens: That is, passion having discoloured his judgement. To colly anciently signified to besmul, to blacken as with coal. Malone: Cole in his Diet., 1679, renders ‘collozv'd by denigratus; to colly, denigro.' Collier (ed. ii): Quelled, i.e. subdued or conquered, is precisely the word wanted, and we find it in the (MS). It is to be remarked that if short-hand were employed in obtaining the copy of Othello for the publisher, the very same letters which spell quelled would also spell 'collied,' and even coold. Singer (Sh. Vind., p. 283): To quell is never used by Shakespeare in any other sense than that of killing or exterminating. I pity the man who could for a moment think of displacing the effective, and now consecrated, word 'collied.' Its obvious meaning is darkened, obfuscated; and a more appropriate and expressive word could not have been used. Dyce (Strictures, &c, p. 199), after referring to the use of 'collied' in Mid. N. D. I, i, 145, and after citing with approval what Singer says of the uniform meaning of quell in Shakespeare, and after quoting what Collier says about short-hand spelling, goes on to say: Yet no one knows better than Mr Collier that the Othello of F, which has the reading 'collied,' was, beyond all doubt, printed from a transcript belonging to the theatre, and that in stage-copies of plays (whether intended for the use of the prompter or of the actors) short-hand was never employed. [Italics, Dyce's.] Keightley [Exp. p. 302): Quelled is not so absurd as Singer thinks it. D'Hugues: On s'etonne qu' Othello puisse trouver de si belles metaphores pour exprimer sa colere, au moment même où il commence à la ressentir."

        "Court and Guard of safetie] Theobald: Guard of safety, though coupled with a word of synonymous construction, was never soldiers' language. I have ventured to make the conjunction and sign of the genitive case change places. So, ‘Court of Guard,’ II, i, 251; ‘look to the Guard,’ II, ii, 16, and ‘bear him to the Court of Guard,’ Ant. & Cleo. IV, ix, 32. Malone: A similar mistake occurs in 'all place of sense and duty,' line 191. 'Court of guard' is established as a technical term by the uniform usage of the poets of Shakespeare's time. The court of safety may, in a metaphorical sense, be understood; but who ever talked of the guard (i.e. the safety) of safety? Steevens: As a collocation of words, as seemingly perverse, occurs in Mid. N. D. Ill, 1, 192, 'I shall desire you of more acquaintance,' I forbear to disturb the text. If Safety, like the Roman Salus, or Recovery in Lear, be personified, where is the impropriety of saying, under the guard of Safety? Thus, Plautus, in his Captivi: 'Neque jam servare Salus, si vult, me potest.' Dyce (ed. iii): Steevens defends the old reading not very satisfactorily. Cowden-Clarke: The text of the Ff means, in the very spot and guarding-place of safety."

[Rymer's innuendo that in the pain upon his forehead Othello here covertly alludes to the forked plague is, I am afraid, only too correct. Delius, also, thus interprets it. Note the use of 'upon.' If this reference was understood by Shakespeare's auditors,—and it seems as though it were scarcely possible in those days to refer to the forehead other than as a groundwork for this plague,—then, in Desdemona's tender response they perceived a proof of her unconscious innocence which is otherwise lost on us.—Ed.]"

        "In these lines Warburton discerned a satirical allusion to the creation of baronets by James the First, and founded on it the date of the composition of the play. For his arguments in this regard and Malone's reply to them, see Appendix, Date of the Composition. Warburton also asserted that \"it is evident that line 55 should be read: 'The hands of old gave hearts'; otherwise it would be no reply to 'For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.' Not so, says her husband, 'The hands of old indeed gave hearts; but the custom now is to give hands without hearts.'\" Johnson: Of emendation there is no need. She says that her hand gave away her heart. He goes on with his suspicion, and the hand which he had before called frank, he now terms liberal; then proceeds to remark that the hand was formerly given by the heart; but now it neither gives it, nor is given by it. Steevens: The phrase \"our new heraldry\" is only figurative, without the least reference to James's creation of baronets. The absurdity of making Othello so familiar with British heraldry, the utter want of consistency as well as policy in any sneer of Shakespeare at the badge of honours instituted by a Prince whom, on all other occasions, he was solicitous to flatter, and at whose court this very piece was acted in 1613, most strongly incline me to question the propriety of Warburton's historical explanation. Malone: The hearts of old, says Othello, dictated the union of hands, which formerly were joined with the hearts of the parties in them; but in our modern marriages, hands alone are united, without hearts. Such is the plain meaning of the words. I do not, however, undertake to maintain that the poet, when he used the word \"heraldry,\" had not the new order of baronets in his thoughts, without intending any satirical allusion. Knight: We do not think that Shakespeare would have gone out of his way to introduce a covert sarcasm at a passing event, offensive as it must have been if understood, and perfectly useless if not understood. The obvious meaning of the words, without any allusion, is plain enough; and \"our new heraldry,\" if it be any more than a figurative expression, may be easily referred to the practice of quartering or joining the arms of husband and wife. Dyce (Remarks, p. 241): The reader will probably recollect with dismay the immense mass of annotation which this passage has called forth in consequence of Warburton's ridiculous idea that the poet alluded here to the new order of baronets created by King James. I have only to observe: first,—that the word \"heraldry\" (which the commentators are surprised at finding here) was evidently suggested to Shakespeare by the words in the preceding line, \"gave hands\" (to \"give arms\" being a heraldic term); secondly, that Warner, in his Albion's England, p. 282, ed. 1596, has, \"My hand shall never give my heart, my heart shall give my hand.\" White (ed. i and ed. ii) adopts Warburton's idea. In his ed. ii he says: \"This seems to be the new heraldry Othello speaks of; but in that case, the passage was probably added after the first production of the play.\""

        "Mrs. Jameson (ii, 38): Desdemona, whose soft credulity, whose turn for the marvellous, whose susceptible imagination had first directed her thoughts and affections to Othello, is precisely the woman to be frightened out of her senses by such a tale as this, and betrayed by her fears into a momentary tergiversation. It is most natural in such a being, and shows us that even in the sweetest natures there can be no completeness and consistency without moral energy. There is an incident in the original tale which could not well be transferred to the drama, but which is very effective, and adds, I think, to the circumstantial horrors of the story. Desdemona does not accidentally drop the handkerchief; it is stolen from her by Iago's little child, an infant of three years old, whom he trains or bribes to the theft. The love of Desdemona for this child, her little playfellow,—the pretty description of her taking it in her arms and caressing it, while it profits by its situation to steal the handkerchief from her bosom, are well imagined, and beautifully told; and the circumstance of Iago employing his own innocent child as the instrument of his infernal villainy adds a deeper, and, in truth, an unnecessary touch of the fiend, to his fiendish character. [It is so common among the critics to accuse Desdemona of telling a falsehood here, that gratitude is due to Mrs Jameson for the milder term \"tergiversation.\" Although Desdemona herself says, \"where should I lose the handkerchief?\" she did not believe it to be actually lost, irrecoverably gone; it was merely mislaid, and a further search would reward her with discovery. If she had not been terrified she might have told all this to Othello (and we should not have had the tragedy, which would be a relief), but, as it is, I think in her soul she believed she was telling the truth.

In fact, we regard these efforts as insults to our understanding; and to such the pride of man is with great difficulty brought to submit.—Tom Jones, ix, 3, quoted by Halliwell."

        "a year or two: Rymer (p. 126): As if for the first year or two Othello had not been jealous? This Third Act begins in the morning, at noon she drops the Handkerchief, after dinner she misses it, and then follows all this outrage and horrible clutter about it. If we believe a small Damosel, in the last scene of this Act, this day is effectually seven days. Our Poet is at this plunge, that whether this Act contains the compass of one day, of seven days, or of seven years, or of all together, the repugnance and the absurdity would be the same. For Othello, all the while, has nothing to say or to do, but what loudly proclaim him jealous; her friend and confidant Emilia again and again rounds her in the ear that the Man is jealous; yet this Venetian dame is neither to see, nor to hear; nor to have any sense or understanding, nor to strike any other note but Cassio, Cassio. Steevens: This line has no reference to the duration of the action, or to the length of time that Desdemona had been married. What Emilia says is a sort of proverbial remark, of general application, where a definite time is put for an indefinite.  Besides, this \"year or two\" may refer to the beginning of the acquaintance and intimacy between the couple. Pye (p. 342): Emilia's saying, \"it is not a year or two shews us a man,\" may be well supposed to insinuate, how then should a month or two, or even a day or two?"

When White represents Shakespeare as making man revert to the Gasteropods or to the Amoebas, his admiration and exaltation of our demi-god go one step farther than mine. \"We know what we are, but we know not what we may be,\" as Ophelia says, so that I may even yet be brought to believe that Shakespeare anticipated Darwin,—but not from this passage.

      "notes": [
        "Instruction] Warburton: The starts and broken reflections in this speech have something very terrible, and show the mind of the speaker to be in inexpressible agonies. But the words we are upon have a sublime in them that can never be enough admired. The ridiculous blunder of writing 'instruction' for induction (for so it should be read) has, indeed, sunk it into arrant nonsense. Othello is just going to fall into a swoon; and, as is common for people in that circumstance, feels an unusual mist and darkness, accompanied with horror, coming upon him. This, with vast sublimity of thought, is compared to the season of the sun's eclipse, at which time the earth becomes shadowed by the induction or bringing over of the moon between it and the sun. This being the allusion, the reasoning stands thus, My nature could never be thus overshadowed, and falling, as it were, into dissolution for no cause. There must be an induction of something; there must be a real cause. My jealousy cannot be merely imaginary. Ideas, words only, could not shake me thus, and raise all this disorder. My jealousy must be grounded, therefore, on matter of fact. This word is used in this sense in Rich. III: IV, iv, 5. Johnson: This is a noble conjecture, and, whether right or wrong, does honour to its author. Yet I am in doubt whether there is any necessity of emendation. There has always prevailed in the world an opinion that, when any great calamity happens at a distance, notice is given of it to the sufferer by some dejection or perturbation of mind, of which he discovers no external cause. This is ascribed to that general communication of one part of the universe with another, which is called sympathy and antipathy; or to the secret monition, instruction, and influence of a Superior Being, which superintends the order of nature and of life. Othello says, Nature could not invest herself in such shadowing passion without instruction. It is not words that shake me thus. This passion which spreads its clouds over me is the effect of some agency, more than the operation of words; it is one of those notices which men have of unseen calamities."

IV, v, 54) wherein Ulysses speaks of 'unclasping the tables of their thoughts To every ticklish reader;' and the same metaphor, Whiter is persuaded, Iago uses here. 'The \"unbookish\" jealousy of Othello,' says Whiter, 'is that which confounds his knowledge in the Books of Love, and blinds his discernment respecting the language of Lovers. It will cause him to mistake the artless smiles and gestures of Cassio for the significant expressions of amorous parley. Whether our Poet intended to comprehend the whole of this meaning, I am not able to decide: I am convinced, however, that this remote epithet \"unbookish,\" as applied to jealousy, was suggested to his mind by the above very singular imagery of the Lover and the Book.'"

        "Steevens: We call the hour in which we are to die, 'the hour of death,'—the time when we are to be judged, 'the day of judgement,'—the instant when we suffer calamity, 'the moment of evil'; and why may we not distinguish the time which brings contempt along with it by the title of 'the time of scorn'? Othello takes his idea from a clock. 'To make me (says he) a fixed figure (on the dial of the world) for the hour of scorn to point and make a full stop at!' By 'slow unmoving finger our poet could have meant only 'so slow that its motion was imperceptible.' Thus, in Ant. & Cleo. III, iii, 22, the messenger, describing the gait of the demure Octavia, says, she creeps; Her motion and her station are as one,' i. e., she moved so slowly that she appeared as if she stood still.",
        "Malone: Might not Shakespeare have written 'for the scorn of time,' &c, i.e., the marked object for the contempt of all ages and all time? So in Ham. III, i, 70, 'the whips and scorns of time.' However, in support of the old copies it may be observed that 'scorn' is personified in the 88th Sonnet: 'And place my merit in the eye of scorn.' The epithet unmoving may likewise derive some support from the 104th Sonnet, in which this very thought is expressed: 'Ah yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand, Steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv'd; So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand, Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv'd.' In the clocks of the last age there was, I think, in the middle of the dial-plate, a figure of Time, which, I believe, was in our poet's thoughts when he wrote the passage in the text. The finger of the dial was the technical phrase. So in Albovine, by D'Avenant, 1629: 'Even as the slow finger of the dial Doth in its motion circular remove To distant figures.' The reading of Ff, 'and moving,' certainly agrees with the image presented, and its counterpart, better than unmoving, which can be applied to a clock only by license of poetry {not appearing to move), and as applied to 'scorn' has but little force, to say nothing of the superfluous epithet 'slow'; there needs no ghost to tell us that that which is unmoving is 'slow.' 'Slow' implies some sort of motion, however little it may be, and therefore appears to me to favour the reading of Ff.",
        "M. Mason: Perhaps we should read, 'slowly moving finger at.'",
        "Hunter: I have little doubt that the particles 'of and 'for' have changed places; and that, on the whole, the true reading is, 'The fixed figure of the time, for Scorn To point his slow and moving finger at.' It is of the nature of that feeling which leads a person to suppose himself an object of scorn and derision, to think of himself also as an object of universal attention. Thus, Othello represents to himself that he shall be 'the fixed figure of the time,' the one object of public attention, every passer-by pointing at him the finger of scorn.",
        "Knight: There is certainly the most extraordinary confusion in Malone's interpretation; if the figure of Time be in the middle, the dial-hand points from it, and not at it, and there is nothing more remarkable in one numeral of a clock than in another. But why are we to have the notion of a clock at all? There is nothing whatever in the passage to warrant us in believing that the poet meant such a metaphor. By the 'fixed figure' we understand, literally, a living man exposed to public shame; or an effigy exhibited to a multitude, as Butler has it, 'To punish in effigie criminals.'"
