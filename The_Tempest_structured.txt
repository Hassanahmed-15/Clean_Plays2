ACT 1 SCENE 1

1: Master: Boatswain!
2: Boatswain: Here, master: what cheer?
3: Master: Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,
4: or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.
5: Boatswain: Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
6: yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the
7: master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
8: if room enough!
9: ALONSO: Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?
10: Play the men.
11: Boatswain: I pray now, keep below.
12: ANTONIO: Where is the master, boatswain?
13: Boatswain: Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
14: cabins: you do assist the storm.
15: GONZALO: Nay, good, be patient.
16: Boatswain: When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
17: for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.
18: GONZALO: Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
19: Boatswain: None that I more love than myself. You are a
20: counsellor; if you can command these elements to
21: silence, and work the peace of the present, we will
22: not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
23: cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make
24: yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
25: the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
26: of our way, I say.
27: GONZALO: I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
28: hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
29: perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his
30: hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,
31: for our own doth little advantage. If he be not
32: born to be hanged, our case is miserable.
33: Boatswain: Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
34: her to try with main-course.
35: A plague upon this howling! they are louder than
36: the weather or our office.
37: Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
38: and drown? Have you a mind to sink?
39: SEBASTIAN: A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
40: incharitable dog!
41: Boatswain: Work you then.
42: ANTONIO: Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!
43: We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
44: GONZALO: I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were
45: no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
46: unstanched wench.
47: Boatswain: Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to
48: sea again; lay her off.
49: Mariners: All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!
50: Boatswain: What, must our mouths be cold?
51: GONZALO: The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,
52: For our case is as theirs.
53: SEBASTIAN: I'm out of patience.
54: ANTONIO: We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
55: This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
56: The washing of ten tides!
57: GONZALO: He'll be hang'd yet,
58: Though every drop of water swear against it
59: And gape at widest to glut him.
60: ANTONIO: Let's all sink with the king.
61: SEBASTIAN: Let's take leave of him.
62: GONZALO: Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
63: acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
64: thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain
65: die a dry death.
ACT 1 SCENE 2

1: MIRANDA: If by your art, my dearest father, you have
2: Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
3: The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
4: But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
5: Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
6: With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
7: Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
8: Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
9: Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
10: Had I been any god of power, I would
11: Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
12: It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
13: The fraughting souls within her.
14: PROSPERO: Be collected:
15: No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
16: There's no harm done.
17: MIRANDA: O, woe the day!
18: PROSPERO: No harm.
19: I have done nothing but in care of thee,
20: Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
21: Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
22: Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
23: Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
24: And thy no greater father.
25: MIRANDA: More to know
26: Did never meddle with my thoughts.
27: PROSPERO: 'Tis time
28: I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
29: And pluck my magic garment from me. So:
30: Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
31: The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
32: The very virtue of compassion in thee,
33: I have with such provision in mine art
34: So safely ordered that there is no soul--
35: No, not so much perdition as an hair
36: Betid to any creature in the vessel
37: Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
38: For thou must now know farther.
39: MIRANDA: You have often
40: Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd
41: And left me to a bootless inquisition,
42: Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'
43: PROSPERO: The hour's now come;
44: The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
45: Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
46: A time before we came unto this cell?
47: I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
48: Out three years old.
49: MIRANDA: Certainly, sir, I can.
50: PROSPERO: By what? by any other house or person?
51: Of any thing the image tell me that
52: Hath kept with thy remembrance.
53: MIRANDA: 'Tis far off
54: And rather like a dream than an assurance
55: That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
56: Four or five women once that tended me?
57: PROSPERO: Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
58: That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
59: In the dark backward and abysm of time?
60: If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,
61: How thou camest here thou mayst.
62: MIRANDA: But that I do not.
63: PROSPERO: Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
64: Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
65: A prince of power.
66: MIRANDA: Sir, are not you my father?
67: PROSPERO: Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
68: She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
69: Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir
70: And princess no worse issued.
71: MIRANDA: O the heavens!
72: What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
73: Or blessed was't we did?
74: PROSPERO: Both, both, my girl:
75: By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
76: But blessedly holp hither.
77: MIRANDA: O, my heart bleeds
78: To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
79: Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.
80: PROSPERO: My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--
81: I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
82: Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
83: Of all the world I loved and to him put
84: The manage of my state; as at that time
85: Through all the signories it was the first
86: And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
87: In dignity, and for the liberal arts
88: Without a parallel; those being all my study,
89: The government I cast upon my brother
90: And to my state grew stranger, being transported
91: And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
92: Dost thou attend me?
93: MIRANDA: Sir, most heedfully.
94: PROSPERO: Being once perfected how to grant suits,
95: How to deny them, who to advance and who
96: To trash for over-topping, new created
97: The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,
98: Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key
99: Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
100: To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was
101: The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
102: And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.
103: MIRANDA: O, good sir, I do.
104: PROSPERO: I pray thee, mark me.
105: I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
106: To closeness and the bettering of my mind
107: With that which, but by being so retired,
108: O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
109: Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
110: Like a good parent, did beget of him
111: A falsehood in its contrary as great
112: As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
113: A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
114: Not only with what my revenue yielded,
115: But what my power might else exact, like one
116: Who having into truth, by telling of it,
117: Made such a sinner of his memory,
118: To credit his own lie, he did believe
119: He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution
120: And executing the outward face of royalty,
121: With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
122: Dost thou hear?
123: MIRANDA: Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
124: PROSPERO: To have no screen between this part he play'd
125: And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
126: Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
127: Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
128: He thinks me now incapable; confederates--
129: So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples
130: To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
131: Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
132: The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--
133: To most ignoble stooping.
134: MIRANDA: O the heavens!
135: PROSPERO: Mark his condition and the event; then tell me
136: If this might be a brother.
137: MIRANDA: I should sin
138: To think but nobly of my grandmother:
139: Good wombs have borne bad sons.
140: PROSPERO: Now the condition.
141: The King of Naples, being an enemy
142: To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
143: Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
144: Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
145: Should presently extirpate me and mine
146: Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
147: With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
148: A treacherous army levied, one midnight
149: Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
150: The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,
151: The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
152: Me and thy crying self.
153: MIRANDA: Alack, for pity!
154: I, not remembering how I cried out then,
155: Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
156: That wrings mine eyes to't.
157: PROSPERO: Hear a little further
158: And then I'll bring thee to the present business
159: Which now's upon's; without the which this story
160: Were most impertinent.
161: MIRANDA: Wherefore did they not
162: That hour destroy us?
163: PROSPERO: Well demanded, wench:
164: My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
165: So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
166: A mark so bloody on the business, but
167: With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
168: In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
169: Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared
170: A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
171: Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
172: Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,
173: To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh
174: To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
175: Did us but loving wrong.
176: MIRANDA: Alack, what trouble
177: Was I then to you!
178: PROSPERO: O, a cherubim
179: Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.
180: Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
181: When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
182: Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me
183: An undergoing stomach, to bear up
184: Against what should ensue.
185: MIRANDA: How came we ashore?
186: PROSPERO: By Providence divine.
187: Some food we had and some fresh water that
188: A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
189: Out of his charity, being then appointed
190: Master of this design, did give us, with
191: Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
192: Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
193: Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
194: From mine own library with volumes that
195: I prize above my dukedom.
196: MIRANDA: Would I might
197: But ever see that man!
198: PROSPERO: Now I arise:
199: Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
200: Here in this island we arrived; and here
201: Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
202: Than other princesses can that have more time
203: For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
204: MIRANDA: Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,
205: For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
206: For raising this sea-storm?
207: PROSPERO: Know thus far forth.
208: By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
209: Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
210: Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
211: I find my zenith doth depend upon
212: A most auspicious star, whose influence
213: If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
214: Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
215: Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
216: And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
217: Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
218: Approach, my Ariel, come.
219: ARIEL: All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
220: To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
221: To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
222: On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
223: Ariel and all his quality.
224: PROSPERO: Hast thou, spirit,
225: Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?
226: ARIEL: To every article.
227: I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
228: Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
229: I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
230: And burn in many places; on the topmast,
231: The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
232: Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors
233: O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
234: And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
235: Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
236: Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
237: Yea, his dread trident shake.
238: PROSPERO: My brave spirit!
239: Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
240: Would not infect his reason?
241: ARIEL: Not a soul
242: But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
243: Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
244: Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
245: Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
246: With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
247: Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty
248: And all the devils are here.'
249: PROSPERO: Why that's my spirit!
250: But was not this nigh shore?
251: ARIEL: Close by, my master.
252: PROSPERO: But are they, Ariel, safe?
253: ARIEL: Not a hair perish'd;
254: On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
255: But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
256: In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
257: The king's son have I landed by himself;
258: Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
259: In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
260: His arms in this sad knot.
261: PROSPERO: Of the king's ship
262: The mariners say how thou hast disposed
263: And all the rest o' the fleet.
264: ARIEL: Safely in harbour
265: Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
266: Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
267: From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
268: The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
269: Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
270: I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet
271: Which I dispersed, they all have met again
272: And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
273: Bound sadly home for Naples,
274: Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
275: And his great person perish.
276: PROSPERO: Ariel, thy charge
277: Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
278: What is the time o' the day?
279: ARIEL: Past the mid season.
280: PROSPERO: At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
281: Must by us both be spent most preciously.
282: ARIEL: Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
283: Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,
284: Which is not yet perform'd me.
285: PROSPERO: How now? moody?
286: What is't thou canst demand?
287: ARIEL: My liberty.
288: PROSPERO: Before the time be out? no more!
289: ARIEL: I prithee,
290: Remember I have done thee worthy service;
291: Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served
292: Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
293: To bate me a full year.
294: PROSPERO: Dost thou forget
295: From what a torment I did free thee?
296: ARIEL: No.
297: PROSPERO: Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
298: Of the salt deep,
299: To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
300: To do me business in the veins o' the earth
301: When it is baked with frost.
302: ARIEL: I do not, sir.
303: PROSPERO: Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
304: The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
305: Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?
306: ARIEL: No, sir.
307: PROSPERO: Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.
308: ARIEL: Sir, in Argier.
309: PROSPERO: O, was she so? I must
310: Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
311: Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,
312: For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
313: To enter human hearing, from Argier,
314: Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did
315: They would not take her life. Is not this true?
316: ARIEL: Ay, sir.
317: PROSPERO: This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child
318: And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
319: As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
320: And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
321: To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
322: Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
323: By help of her more potent ministers
324: And in her most unmitigable rage,
325: Into a cloven pine; within which rift
326: Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
327: A dozen years; within which space she died
328: And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans
329: As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
330: Save for the son that she did litter here,
331: A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
332: A human shape.
333: ARIEL: Yes, Caliban her son.
334: PROSPERO: Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban
335: Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
336: What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
337: Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
338: Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
339: To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
340: Could not again undo: it was mine art,
341: When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
342: The pine and let thee out.
343: ARIEL: I thank thee, master.
344: PROSPERO: If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
345: And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
346: Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.
347: ARIEL: Pardon, master;
348: I will be correspondent to command
349: And do my spiriting gently.
350: PROSPERO: Do so, and after two days
351: I will discharge thee.
352: ARIEL: That's my noble master!
353: What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?
354: PROSPERO: Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject
355: To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
356: To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
357: And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!
358: Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!
359: MIRANDA: The strangeness of your story put
360: Heaviness in me.
361: PROSPERO: Shake it off. Come on;
362: We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never
363: Yields us kind answer.
364: MIRANDA: 'Tis a villain, sir,
365: I do not love to look on.
366: PROSPERO: But, as 'tis,
367: We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
368: Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
369: That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
370: Thou earth, thou! speak.
371: CALIBAN: [Within] There's wood enough within.
372: PROSPERO: Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:
373: Come, thou tortoise! when?
374: Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
375: Hark in thine ear.
376: ARIEL: My lord it shall be done.
377: PROSPERO: Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
378: Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!
379: CALIBAN: As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
380: With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
381: Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
382: And blister you all o'er!
383: PROSPERO: For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,
384: Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
385: Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
386: All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
387: As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
388: Than bees that made 'em.
389: CALIBAN: I must eat my dinner.
390: This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
391: Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
392: Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
393: Water with berries in't, and teach me how
394: To name the bigger light, and how the less,
395: That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee
396: And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,
397: The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
398: Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
399: Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
400: For I am all the subjects that you have,
401: Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
402: In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
403: The rest o' the island.
404: PROSPERO: Thou most lying slave,
405: Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,
406: Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee
407: In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
408: The honour of my child.
409: CALIBAN: O ho, O ho! would't had been done!
410: Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
411: This isle with Calibans.
412: PROSPERO: Abhorred slave,
413: Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
414: Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
415: Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
416: One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,
417: Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
418: A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
419: With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
420: Though thou didst learn, had that in't which
421: good natures
422: Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
423: Deservedly confined into this rock,
424: Who hadst deserved more than a prison.
425: CALIBAN: You taught me language; and my profit on't
426: Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
427: For learning me your language!
428: PROSPERO: Hag-seed, hence!
429: Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,
430: To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?
431: If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
432: What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
433: Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar
434: That beasts shall tremble at thy din.
435: CALIBAN: No, pray thee.
436: I must obey: his art is of such power,
437: It would control my dam's god, Setebos,
438: and make a vassal of him.
439: PROSPERO: So, slave; hence!
440: ARIEL'S song.
441: Come unto these yellow sands,
442: And then take hands:
443: Courtsied when you have and kiss'd
444: The wild waves whist,
445: Foot it featly here and there;
446: And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
447: Hark, hark!
448: The watch-dogs bark!
449: Hark, hark! I hear
450: The strain of strutting chanticleer
451: Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.
452: FERDINAND: Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
453: It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon
454: Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
455: Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
456: This music crept by me upon the waters,
457: Allaying both their fury and my passion
458: With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
459: Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
460: No, it begins again.
461: Full fathom five thy father lies;
462: Of his bones are coral made;
463: Those are pearls that were his eyes:
464: Nothing of him that doth fade
465: But doth suffer a sea-change
466: Into something rich and strange.
467: Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
468: Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.
469: The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
470: This is no mortal business, nor no sound
471: That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.
472: PROSPERO: The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
473: And say what thou seest yond.
474: MIRANDA: What is't? a spirit?
475: Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
476: It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.
477: PROSPERO: No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
478: As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
479: Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd
480: With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him
481: A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows
482: And strays about to find 'em.
483: MIRANDA: I might call him
484: A thing divine, for nothing natural
485: I ever saw so noble.
486: PROSPERO: [Aside] It goes on, I see,
487: As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee
488: Within two days for this.
489: FERDINAND: Most sure, the goddess
490: On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
491: May know if you remain upon this island;
492: And that you will some good instruction give
493: How I may bear me here: my prime request,
494: Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
495: If you be maid or no?
496: MIRANDA: No wonder, sir;
497: But certainly a maid.
498: FERDINAND: My language! heavens!
499: I am the best of them that speak this speech,
500: Were I but where 'tis spoken.
501: PROSPERO: How? the best?
502: What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?
503: FERDINAND: A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
504: To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
505: And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
506: Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
507: The king my father wreck'd.
508: MIRANDA: Alack, for mercy!
509: FERDINAND: Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan
510: And his brave son being twain.
511: PROSPERO: [Aside] The Duke of Milan
512: And his more braver daughter could control thee,
513: If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight
514: They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
515: I'll set thee free for this.
516: A word, good sir;
517: I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.
518: MIRANDA: Why speaks my father so ungently? This
519: Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first
520: That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
521: To be inclined my way!
522: FERDINAND: O, if a virgin,
523: And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
524: The queen of Naples.
525: PROSPERO: Soft, sir! one word more.
526: They are both in either's powers; but this swift business
527: I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
528: Make the prize light.
529: One word more; I charge thee
530: That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
531: The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
532: Upon this island as a spy, to win it
533: From me, the lord on't.
534: FERDINAND: No, as I am a man.
535: MIRANDA: There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
536: If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
537: Good things will strive to dwell with't.
538: PROSPERO: Follow me.
539: Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
540: I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
541: Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
542: The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks
543: Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.
544: FERDINAND: No;
545: I will resist such entertainment till
546: Mine enemy has more power.
547: MIRANDA: O dear father,
548: Make not too rash a trial of him, for
549: He's gentle and not fearful.
550: PROSPERO: What? I say,
551: My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;
552: Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience
553: Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,
554: For I can here disarm thee with this stick
555: And make thy weapon drop.
556: MIRANDA: Beseech you, father.
557: PROSPERO: Hence! hang not on my garments.
558: MIRANDA: Sir, have pity;
559: I'll be his surety.
560: PROSPERO: Silence! one word more
561: Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
562: An advocate for an imposter! hush!
563: Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
564: Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
565: To the most of men this is a Caliban
566: And they to him are angels.
567: MIRANDA: My affections
568: Are then most humble; I have no ambition
569: To see a goodlier man.
570: PROSPERO: Come on; obey:
571: Thy nerves are in their infancy again
572: And have no vigour in them.
573: FERDINAND: So they are;
574: My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
575: My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
576: The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
577: To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
578: Might I but through my prison once a day
579: Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
580: Let liberty make use of; space enough
581: Have I in such a prison.
582: PROSPERO: [Aside] It works.
583: Come on.
584: Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!
585: Follow me.
586: Hark what thou else shalt do me.
587: MIRANDA: Be of comfort;
588: My father's of a better nature, sir,
589: Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
590: Which now came from him.
591: PROSPERO: Thou shalt be free
592: As mountain winds: but then exactly do
593: All points of my command.
594: ARIEL: To the syllable.
ACT 2 SCENE 1

1: GONZALO: Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
2: So have we all, of joy; for our escape
3: Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
4: Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
5: The masters of some merchant and the merchant
6: Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
7: I mean our preservation, few in millions
8: Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
9: Our sorrow with our comfort.
10: ALONSO: Prithee, peace.
11: SEBASTIAN: He receives comfort like cold porridge.
12: ANTONIO: The visitor will not give him o'er so.
13: SEBASTIAN: Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
14: by and by it will strike.
15: GONZALO: Sir,--
16: SEBASTIAN: One: tell.
17: GONZALO: When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
18: Comes to the entertainer--
19: SEBASTIAN: A dollar.
20: GONZALO: Dolour comes to him, indeed: you
21: have spoken truer than you purposed.
22: SEBASTIAN: You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
23: GONZALO: Therefore, my lord,--
24: ANTONIO: Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
25: ALONSO: I prithee, spare.
26: GONZALO: Well, I have done: but yet,--
27: SEBASTIAN: He will be talking.
28: ANTONIO: Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
29: wager, first begins to crow?
30: SEBASTIAN: The old cock.
31: ANTONIO: The cockerel.
32: SEBASTIAN: Done. The wager?
33: ANTONIO: A laughter.
34: SEBASTIAN: A match!
35: ADRIAN: Though this island seem to be desert,--
36: SEBASTIAN: Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.
37: ADRIAN: Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--
38: SEBASTIAN: Yet,--
39: ADRIAN: Yet,--
40: ANTONIO: He could not miss't.
41: ADRIAN: It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate
42: temperance.
43: ANTONIO: Temperance was a delicate wench.
44: SEBASTIAN: Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.
45: ADRIAN: The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
46: SEBASTIAN: As if it had lungs and rotten ones.
47: ANTONIO: Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.
48: GONZALO: Here is everything advantageous to life.
49: ANTONIO: True; save means to live.
50: SEBASTIAN: Of that there's none, or little.
51: GONZALO: How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
52: ANTONIO: The ground indeed is tawny.
53: SEBASTIAN: With an eye of green in't.
54: ANTONIO: He misses not much.
55: SEBASTIAN: No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
56: GONZALO: But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost
57: beyond credit,--
58: SEBASTIAN: As many vouched rarities are.
59: GONZALO: That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in
60: the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and
61: glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with
62: salt water.
63: ANTONIO: If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not
64: say he lies?
65: SEBASTIAN: Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report
66: GONZALO: Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
67: put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of
68: the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
69: SEBASTIAN: 'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.
70: ADRIAN: Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
71: their queen.
72: GONZALO: Not since widow Dido's time.
73: ANTONIO: Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
74: widow Dido!
75: SEBASTIAN: What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,
76: how you take it!
77: ADRIAN: 'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:
78: she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
79: GONZALO: This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
80: ADRIAN: Carthage?
81: GONZALO: I assure you, Carthage.
82: SEBASTIAN: His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath
83: raised the wall and houses too.
84: ANTONIO: What impossible matter will he make easy next?
85: SEBASTIAN: I think he will carry this island home in his pocket
86: and give it his son for an apple.
87: ANTONIO: And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
88: forth more islands.
89: GONZALO: Ay.
90: ANTONIO: Why, in good time.
91: GONZALO: Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
92: as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
93: of your daughter, who is now queen.
94: ANTONIO: And the rarest that e'er came there.
95: SEBASTIAN: Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
96: ANTONIO: O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.
97: GONZALO: Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
98: wore it? I mean, in a sort.
99: ANTONIO: That sort was well fished for.
100: GONZALO: When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
101: ALONSO: You cram these words into mine ears against
102: The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
103: Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
104: My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
105: Who is so far from Italy removed
106: I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
107: Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
108: Hath made his meal on thee?
109: FRANCISCO: Sir, he may live:
110: I saw him beat the surges under him,
111: And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,
112: Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
113: The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
114: 'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
115: Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
116: To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
117: As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
118: He came alive to land.
119: ALONSO: No, no, he's gone.
120: SEBASTIAN: Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
121: That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
122: But rather lose her to an African;
123: Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
124: Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.
125: ALONSO: Prithee, peace.
126: SEBASTIAN: You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
127: By all of us, and the fair soul herself
128: Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
129: Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your
130: son,
131: I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
132: More widows in them of this business' making
133: Than we bring men to comfort them:
134: The fault's your own.
135: ALONSO: So is the dear'st o' the loss.
136: GONZALO: My lord Sebastian,
137: The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
138: And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
139: When you should bring the plaster.
140: SEBASTIAN: Very well.
141: ANTONIO: And most chirurgeonly.
142: GONZALO: It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
143: When you are cloudy.
144: SEBASTIAN: Foul weather?
145: ANTONIO: Very foul.
146: GONZALO: Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--
147: ANTONIO: He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.
148: SEBASTIAN: Or docks, or mallows.
149: GONZALO: And were the king on't, what would I do?
150: SEBASTIAN: 'Scape being drunk for want of wine.
151: GONZALO: I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
152: Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
153: Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
154: Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
155: And use of service, none; contract, succession,
156: Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
157: No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
158: No occupation; all men idle, all;
159: And women too, but innocent and pure;
160: No sovereignty;--
161: SEBASTIAN: Yet he would be king on't.
162: ANTONIO: The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
163: beginning.
164: GONZALO: All things in common nature should produce
165: Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
166: Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
167: Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
168: Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
169: To feed my innocent people.
170: SEBASTIAN: No marrying 'mong his subjects?
171: ANTONIO: None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.
172: GONZALO: I would with such perfection govern, sir,
173: To excel the golden age.
174: SEBASTIAN: God save his majesty!
175: ANTONIO: Long live Gonzalo!
176: GONZALO: And,--do you mark me, sir?
177: ALONSO: Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.
178: GONZALO: I do well believe your highness; and
179: did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,
180: who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
181: they always use to laugh at nothing.
182: ANTONIO: 'Twas you we laughed at.
183: GONZALO: Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
184: to you: so you may continue and laugh at
185: nothing still.
186: ANTONIO: What a blow was there given!
187: SEBASTIAN: An it had not fallen flat-long.
188: GONZALO: You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift
189: the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue
190: in it five weeks without changing.
191: SEBASTIAN: We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.
192: ANTONIO: Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
193: GONZALO: No, I warrant you; I will not adventure
194: my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
195: me asleep, for I am very heavy?
196: ANTONIO: Go sleep, and hear us.
197: ALONSO: What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
198: Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
199: They are inclined to do so.
200: SEBASTIAN: Please you, sir,
201: Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
202: It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
203: It is a comforter.
204: ANTONIO: We two, my lord,
205: Will guard your person while you take your rest,
206: And watch your safety.
207: ALONSO: Thank you. Wondrous heavy.
208: SEBASTIAN: What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
209: ANTONIO: It is the quality o' the climate.
210: SEBASTIAN: Why
211: Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
212: Myself disposed to sleep.
213: ANTONIO: Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
214: They fell together all, as by consent;
215: They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
216: Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
217: And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,
218: What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and
219: My strong imagination sees a crown
220: Dropping upon thy head.
221: SEBASTIAN: What, art thou waking?
222: ANTONIO: Do you not hear me speak?
223: SEBASTIAN: I do; and surely
224: It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
225: Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
226: This is a strange repose, to be asleep
227: With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,
228: And yet so fast asleep.
229: ANTONIO: Noble Sebastian,
230: Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
231: Whiles thou art waking.
232: SEBASTIAN: Thou dost snore distinctly;
233: There's meaning in thy snores.
234: ANTONIO: I am more serious than my custom: you
235: Must be so too, if heed me; which to do
236: Trebles thee o'er.
237: SEBASTIAN: Well, I am standing water.
238: ANTONIO: I'll teach you how to flow.
239: SEBASTIAN: Do so: to ebb
240: Hereditary sloth instructs me.
241: ANTONIO: O,
242: If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
243: Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
244: You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
245: Most often do so near the bottom run
246: By their own fear or sloth.
247: SEBASTIAN: Prithee, say on:
248: The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
249: A matter from thee, and a birth indeed
250: Which throes thee much to yield.
251: ANTONIO: Thus, sir:
252: Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,
253: Who shall be of as little memory
254: When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--
255: For he's a spirit of persuasion, only
256: Professes to persuade,--the king his son's alive,
257: 'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
258: And he that sleeps here swims.
259: SEBASTIAN: I have no hope
260: That he's undrown'd.
261: ANTONIO: O, out of that 'no hope'
262: What great hope have you! no hope that way is
263: Another way so high a hope that even
264: Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
265: But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
266: That Ferdinand is drown'd?
267: SEBASTIAN: He's gone.
268: ANTONIO: Then, tell me,
269: Who's the next heir of Naples?
270: SEBASTIAN: Claribel.
271: ANTONIO: She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
272: Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples
273: Can have no note, unless the sun were post--
274: The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins
275: Be rough and razorable; she that--from whom?
276: We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,
277: And by that destiny to perform an act
278: Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come
279: In yours and my discharge.
280: SEBASTIAN: What stuff is this! how say you?
281: 'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;
282: So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions
283: There is some space.
284: ANTONIO: A space whose every cubit
285: Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel
286: Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,
287: And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death
288: That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse
289: Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
290: As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
291: As amply and unnecessarily
292: As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
293: A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
294: The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
295: For your advancement! Do you understand me?
296: SEBASTIAN: Methinks I do.
297: ANTONIO: And how does your content
298: Tender your own good fortune?
299: SEBASTIAN: I remember
300: You did supplant your brother Prospero.
301: ANTONIO: True:
302: And look how well my garments sit upon me;
303: Much feater than before: my brother's servants
304: Were then my fellows; now they are my men.
305: SEBASTIAN: But, for your conscience?
306: ANTONIO: Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,
307: 'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not
308: This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,
309: That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they
310: And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,
311: No better than the earth he lies upon,
312: If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;
313: Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
314: Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,
315: To the perpetual wink for aye might put
316: This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
317: Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,
318: They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
319: They'll tell the clock to any business that
320: We say befits the hour.
321: SEBASTIAN: Thy case, dear friend,
322: Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,
323: I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke
324: Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;
325: And I the king shall love thee.
326: ANTONIO: Draw together;
327: And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
328: To fall it on Gonzalo.
329: SEBASTIAN: O, but one word.
330: ARIEL: My master through his art foresees the danger
331: That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth--
332: For else his project dies--to keep them living.
333: While you here do snoring lie,
334: Open-eyed conspiracy
335: His time doth take.
336: If of life you keep a care,
337: Shake off slumber, and beware:
338: Awake, awake!
339: ANTONIO: Then let us both be sudden.
340: GONZALO: Now, good angels
341: Preserve the king.
342: ALONSO: Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?
343: Wherefore this ghastly looking?
344: GONZALO: What's the matter?
345: SEBASTIAN: Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
346: Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
347: Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?
348: It struck mine ear most terribly.
349: ALONSO: I heard nothing.
350: ANTONIO: O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
351: To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar
352: Of a whole herd of lions.
353: ALONSO: Heard you this, Gonzalo?
354: GONZALO: Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
355: And that a strange one too, which did awake me:
356: I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,
357: I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,
358: That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,
359: Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons.
360: ALONSO: Lead off this ground; and let's make further search
361: For my poor son.
362: GONZALO: Heavens keep him from these beasts!
363: For he is, sure, i' the island.
364: ALONSO: Lead away.
365: ARIEL: Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:
366: So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.
ACT 2 SCENE 2

1: CALIBAN: All the infections that the sun sucks up
2: From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him
3: By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me
4: And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,
5: Fright me with urchin--shows, pitch me i' the mire,
6: Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
7: Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
8: For every trifle are they set upon me;
9: Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
10: And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which
11: Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
12: Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I
13: All wound with adders who with cloven tongues
14: Do hiss me into madness.
15: Lo, now, lo!
16: Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me
17: For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;
18: Perchance he will not mind me.
19: TRINCULO: Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off
20: any weather at all, and another storm brewing;
21: I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black
22: cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul
23: bombard that would shed his liquor. If it
24: should thunder as it did before, I know not
25: where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot
26: choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we
27: here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:
28: he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-
29: like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-
30: John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,
31: as once I was, and had but this fish painted,
32: not a holiday fool there but would give a piece
33: of silver: there would this monster make a
34: man; any strange beast there makes a man:
35: when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame
36: beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead
37: Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like
38: arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose
39: my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,
40: but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a
41: thunderbolt.
42: Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is to
43: creep under his gaberdine; there is no other
44: shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with
45: strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the
46: dregs of the storm be past.
47: STEPHANO: I shall no more to sea, to sea,
48: Here shall I die ashore--
49: This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's
50: funeral: well, here's my comfort.
51: The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,
52: The gunner and his mate
53: Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,
54: But none of us cared for Kate;
55: For she had a tongue with a tang,
56: Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!
57: She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,
58: Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch:
59: Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!
60: This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.
61: CALIBAN: Do not torment me: Oh!
62: STEPHANO: What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put
63: tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha? I
64: have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your
65: four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as
66: ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;
67: and it shall be said so again while Stephano
68: breathes at's nostrils.
69: CALIBAN: The spirit torments me; Oh!
70: STEPHANO: This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who
71: hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil
72: should he learn our language? I will give him some
73: relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him
74: and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a
75: present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.
76: CALIBAN: Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.
77: STEPHANO: He's in his fit now and does not talk after the
78: wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have
79: never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his
80: fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will
81: not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that
82: hath him, and that soundly.
83: CALIBAN: Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I
84: know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.
85: STEPHANO: Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that
86: which will give language to you, cat: open your
87: mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you,
88: and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend:
89: open your chaps again.
90: TRINCULO: I should know that voice: it should be--but he is
91: drowned; and these are devils: O defend me!
92: STEPHANO: Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster!
93: His forward voice now is to speak well of his
94: friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches
95: and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will
96: recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I
97: will pour some in thy other mouth.
98: TRINCULO: Stephano!
99: STEPHANO: Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This is
100: a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have no
101: long spoon.
102: TRINCULO: Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me and
103: speak to me: for I am Trinculo--be not afeard--thy
104: good friend Trinculo.
105: STEPHANO: If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull thee
106: by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's legs,
107: these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How
108: camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can
109: he vent Trinculos?
110: TRINCULO: I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But
111: art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art
112: not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me
113: under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of
114: the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O
115: Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!
116: STEPHANO: Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.
117: CALIBAN: [Aside] These be fine things, an if they be
118: not sprites.
119: That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.
120: I will kneel to him.
121: STEPHANO: How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?
122: swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I
123: escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors
124: heaved o'erboard, by this bottle; which I made of
125: the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was
126: cast ashore.
127: CALIBAN: I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject;
128: for the liquor is not earthly.
129: STEPHANO: Here; swear then how thou escapedst.
130: TRINCULO: Swum ashore. man, like a duck: I can swim like a
131: duck, I'll be sworn.
132: STEPHANO: Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a
133: duck, thou art made like a goose.
134: TRINCULO: O Stephano. hast any more of this?
135: STEPHANO: The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by the
136: sea-side where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!
137: how does thine ague?
138: CALIBAN: Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?
139: STEPHANO: Out o' the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i'
140: the moon when time was.
141: CALIBAN: I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:
142: My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.
143: STEPHANO: Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish
144: it anon with new contents swear.
145: TRINCULO: By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!
146: I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The man i'
147: the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well
148: drawn, monster, in good sooth!
149: CALIBAN: I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;
150: And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.
151: TRINCULO: By this light, a most perfidious and drunken
152: monster! when 's god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle.
153: CALIBAN: I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.
154: STEPHANO: Come on then; down, and swear.
155: TRINCULO: I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed
156: monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my
157: heart to beat him,--
158: STEPHANO: Come, kiss.
159: TRINCULO: But that the poor monster's in drink: an abominable monster!
160: CALIBAN: I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries;
161: I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.
162: A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
163: I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,
164: Thou wondrous man.
165: TRINCULO: A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a
166: Poor drunkard!
167: CALIBAN: I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;
168: And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts;
169: Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how
170: To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee
171: To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee
172: Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?
173: STEPHANO: I prithee now, lead the way without any more
174: talking. Trinculo, the king and all our company
175: else being drowned, we will inherit here: here;
176: bear my bottle: fellow Trinculo, we'll fill him by
177: and by again.
178: CALIBAN: [Sings drunkenly]
179: Farewell master; farewell, farewell!
180: TRINCULO: A howling monster: a drunken monster!
181: CALIBAN: No more dams I'll make for fish
182: Nor fetch in firing
183: At requiring;
184: Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish
185: 'Ban, 'Ban, Cacaliban
186: Has a new master: get a new man.
187: Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom,
188: hey-day, freedom!
ACT 3 SCENE 1

1: FERDINAND: There be some sports are painful, and their labour
2: Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
3: Are nobly undergone and most poor matters
4: Point to rich ends. This my mean task
5: Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
6: The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead
7: And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is
8: Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,
9: And he's composed of harshness. I must remove
10: Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,
11: Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
12: Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness
13: Had never like executor. I forget:
14: But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
15: Most busy lest, when I do it.
16: MIRANDA: Alas, now, pray you,
17: Work not so hard: I would the lightning had
18: Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!
19: Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,
20: 'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
21: Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself;
22: He's safe for these three hours.
23: FERDINAND: O most dear mistress,
24: The sun will set before I shall discharge
25: What I must strive to do.
26: MIRANDA: If you'll sit down,
27: I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;
28: I'll carry it to the pile.
29: FERDINAND: No, precious creature;
30: I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
31: Than you should such dishonour undergo,
32: While I sit lazy by.
33: MIRANDA: It would become me
34: As well as it does you: and I should do it
35: With much more ease; for my good will is to it,
36: And yours it is against.
37: PROSPERO: Poor worm, thou art infected!
38: This visitation shows it.
39: MIRANDA: You look wearily.
40: FERDINAND: No, noble mistress;'tis fresh morning with me
41: When you are by at night. I do beseech you--
42: Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--
43: What is your name?
44: MIRANDA: Miranda.--O my father,
45: I have broke your hest to say so!
46: FERDINAND: Admired Miranda!
47: Indeed the top of admiration! worth
48: What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
49: I have eyed with best regard and many a time
50: The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
51: Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues
52: Have I liked several women; never any
53: With so fun soul, but some defect in her
54: Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
55: And put it to the foil: but you, O you,
56: So perfect and so peerless, are created
57: Of every creature's best!
58: MIRANDA: I do not know
59: One of my sex; no woman's face remember,
60: Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen
61: More that I may call men than you, good friend,
62: And my dear father: how features are abroad,
63: I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,
64: The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
65: Any companion in the world but you,
66: Nor can imagination form a shape,
67: Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
68: Something too wildly and my father's precepts
69: I therein do forget.
70: FERDINAND: I am in my condition
71: A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;
72: I would, not so!--and would no more endure
73: This wooden slavery than to suffer
74: The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
75: The very instant that I saw you, did
76: My heart fly to your service; there resides,
77: To make me slave to it; and for your sake
78: Am I this patient log--man.
79: MIRANDA: Do you love me?
80: FERDINAND: O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound
81: And crown what I profess with kind event
82: If I speak true! if hollowly, invert
83: What best is boded me to mischief! I
84: Beyond all limit of what else i' the world
85: Do love, prize, honour you.
86: MIRANDA: I am a fool
87: To weep at what I am glad of.
88: PROSPERO: Fair encounter
89: Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
90: On that which breeds between 'em!
91: FERDINAND: Wherefore weep you?
92: MIRANDA: At mine unworthiness that dare not offer
93: What I desire to give, and much less take
94: What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;
95: And all the more it seeks to hide itself,
96: The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!
97: And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
98: I am your wife, if you will marry me;
99: If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow
100: You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,
101: Whether you will or no.
102: FERDINAND: My mistress, dearest;
103: And I thus humble ever.
104: MIRANDA: My husband, then?
105: FERDINAND: Ay, with a heart as willing
106: As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.
107: MIRANDA: And mine, with my heart in't; and now farewell
108: Till half an hour hence.
109: FERDINAND: A thousand thousand!
110: PROSPERO: So glad of this as they I cannot be,
111: Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing
112: At nothing can be more. I'll to my book,
113: For yet ere supper-time must I perform
114: Much business appertaining.
ACT 3 SCENE 2

1: STEPHANO: Tell not me; when the butt is out, we will drink
2: water; not a drop before: therefore bear up, and
3: board 'em. Servant-monster, drink to me.
4: TRINCULO: Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They
5: say there's but five upon this isle: we are three
6: of them; if th' other two be brained like us, the
7: state totters.
8: STEPHANO: Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes
9: are almost set in thy head.
10: TRINCULO: Where should they be set else? he were a brave
11: monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.
12: STEPHANO: My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:
13: for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I
14: could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off
15: and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,
16: monster, or my standard.
17: TRINCULO: Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.
18: STEPHANO: We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.
19: TRINCULO: Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say
20: nothing neither.
21: STEPHANO: Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a
22: good moon-calf.
23: CALIBAN: How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
24: I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.
25: TRINCULO: Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to
26: justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou,
27: was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much
28: sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie,
29: being but half a fish and half a monster?
30: CALIBAN: Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?
31: TRINCULO: 'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!
32: CALIBAN: Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.
33: STEPHANO: Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you
34: prove a mutineer,--the next tree! The poor monster's
35: my subject and he shall not suffer indignity.
36: CALIBAN: I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to
37: hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?
38: STEPHANO: Marry, will I kneel and repeat it; I will stand,
39: and so shall Trinculo.
40: CALIBAN: As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a
41: sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.
42: ARIEL: Thou liest.
43: CALIBAN: Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou: I would my
44: valiant master would destroy thee! I do not lie.
45: STEPHANO: Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by
46: this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.
47: TRINCULO: Why, I said nothing.
48: STEPHANO: Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.
49: CALIBAN: I say, by sorcery he got this isle;
50: From me he got it. if thy greatness will
51: Revenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,
52: But this thing dare not,--
53: STEPHANO: That's most certain.
54: CALIBAN: Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.
55: STEPHANO: How now shall this be compassed?
56: Canst thou bring me to the party?
57: CALIBAN: Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,
58: Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.
59: ARIEL: Thou liest; thou canst not.
60: CALIBAN: What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!
61: I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows
62: And take his bottle from him: when that's gone
63: He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him
64: Where the quick freshes are.
65: STEPHANO: Trinculo, run into no further danger:
66: interrupt the monster one word further, and,
67: by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors
68: and make a stock-fish of thee.
69: TRINCULO: Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther
70: off.
71: STEPHANO: Didst thou not say he lied?
72: ARIEL: Thou liest.
73: STEPHANO: Do I so? take thou that.
74: As you like this, give me the lie another time.
75: TRINCULO: I did not give the lie. Out o' your
76: wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!
77: this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on
78: your monster, and the devil take your fingers!
79: CALIBAN: Ha, ha, ha!
80: STEPHANO: Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther
81: off.
82: CALIBAN: Beat him enough: after a little time
83: I'll beat him too.
84: STEPHANO: Stand farther. Come, proceed.
85: CALIBAN: Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,
86: I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,
87: Having first seized his books, or with a log
88: Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
89: Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
90: First to possess his books; for without them
91: He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
92: One spirit to command: they all do hate him
93: As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
94: He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them--
95: Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal
96: And that most deeply to consider is
97: The beauty of his daughter; he himself
98: Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,
99: But only Sycorax my dam and she;
100: But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
101: As great'st does least.
102: STEPHANO: Is it so brave a lass?
103: CALIBAN: Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.
104: And bring thee forth brave brood.
105: STEPHANO: Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I
106: will be king and queen--save our graces!--and
107: Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou
108: like the plot, Trinculo?
109: TRINCULO: Excellent.
110: STEPHANO: Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,
111: while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.
112: CALIBAN: Within this half hour will he be asleep:
113: Wilt thou destroy him then?
114: STEPHANO: Ay, on mine honour.
115: ARIEL: This will I tell my master.
116: CALIBAN: Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:
117: Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
118: You taught me but while-ere?
119: STEPHANO: At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any
120: reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
121: Flout 'em and scout 'em
122: And scout 'em and flout 'em
123: Thought is free.
124: CALIBAN: That's not the tune.
125: STEPHANO: What is this same?
126: TRINCULO: This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture
127: of Nobody.
128: STEPHANO: If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:
129: if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.
130: TRINCULO: O, forgive me my sins!
131: STEPHANO: He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!
132: CALIBAN: Art thou afeard?
133: STEPHANO: No, monster, not I.
134: CALIBAN: Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,
135: Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
136: Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
137: Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices
138: That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
139: Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,
140: The clouds methought would open and show riches
141: Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,
142: I cried to dream again.
143: STEPHANO: This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall
144: have my music for nothing.
145: CALIBAN: When Prospero is destroyed.
146: STEPHANO: That shall be by and by: I remember the story.
147: TRINCULO: The sound is going away; let's follow it, and
148: after do our work.
149: STEPHANO: Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see
150: this tabourer; he lays it on.
151: TRINCULO: Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano.
ACT 3 SCENE 3

1: GONZALO: By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;
2: My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed
3: Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
4: I needs must rest me.
5: ALONSO: Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
6: Who am myself attach'd with weariness,
7: To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
8: Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
9: No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
10: Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
11: Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.
12: ANTONIO: [Aside to SEBASTIAN] I am right glad that he's so
13: out of hope.
14: Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose
15: That you resolved to effect.
16: SEBASTIAN: [Aside to ANTONIO] The next advantage
17: Will we take throughly.
18: ANTONIO: [Aside to SEBASTIAN] Let it be to-night;
19: For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they
20: Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
21: As when they are fresh.
22: SEBASTIAN: [Aside to ANTONIO] I say, to-night: no more.
23: ALONSO: What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!
24: GONZALO: Marvellous sweet music!
25: ALONSO: Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?
26: SEBASTIAN: A living drollery. Now I will believe
27: That there are unicorns, that in Arabia
28: There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix
29: At this hour reigning there.
30: ANTONIO: I'll believe both;
31: And what does else want credit, come to me,
32: And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did
33: lie,
34: Though fools at home condemn 'em.
35: GONZALO: If in Naples
36: I should report this now, would they believe me?
37: If I should say, I saw such islanders--
38: For, certes, these are people of the island--
39: Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,
40: Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
41: Our human generation you shall find
42: Many, nay, almost any.
43: PROSPERO: [Aside] Honest lord,
44: Thou hast said well; for some of you there present
45: Are worse than devils.
46: ALONSO: I cannot too much muse
47: Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,
48: Although they want the use of tongue, a kind
49: Of excellent dumb discourse.
50: PROSPERO: [Aside] Praise in departing.
51: FRANCISCO: They vanish'd strangely.
52: SEBASTIAN: No matter, since
53: They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.
54: Will't please you taste of what is here?
55: ALONSO: Not I.
56: GONZALO: Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
57: Who would believe that there were mountaineers
58: Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em
59: Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
60: Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
61: Each putter-out of five for one will bring us
62: Good warrant of.
63: ALONSO: I will stand to and feed,
64: Although my last: no matter, since I feel
65: The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,
66: Stand to and do as we.
67: ARIEL: You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,
68: That hath to instrument this lower world
69: And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea
70: Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island
71: Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men
72: Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
73: And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
74: Their proper selves.
75: You fools! I and my fellows
76: Are ministers of Fate: the elements,
77: Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well
78: Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs
79: Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
80: One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers
81: Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
82: Your swords are now too massy for your strengths
83: And will not be uplifted. But remember--
84: For that's my business to you--that you three
85: From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
86: Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
87: Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed
88: The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
89: Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
90: Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
91: They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:
92: Lingering perdition, worse than any death
93: Can be at once, shall step by step attend
94: You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--
95: Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls
96: Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow
97: And a clear life ensuing.
98: PROSPERO: Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
99: Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:
100: Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
101: In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life
102: And observation strange, my meaner ministers
103: Their several kinds have done. My high charms work
104: And these mine enemies are all knit up
105: In their distractions; they now are in my power;
106: And in these fits I leave them, while I visit
107: Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,
108: And his and mine loved darling.
109: GONZALO: I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you
110: In this strange stare?
111: ALONSO: O, it is monstrous, monstrous:
112: Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;
113: The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,
114: That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced
115: The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
116: Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and
117: I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
118: And with him there lie mudded.
119: SEBASTIAN: But one fiend at a time,
120: I'll fight their legions o'er.
121: ANTONIO: I'll be thy second.
122: GONZALO: All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,
123: Like poison given to work a great time after,
124: Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you
125: That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly
126: And hinder them from what this ecstasy
127: May now provoke them to.
ACT 4 SCENE 1

1: PROSPERO: If I have too austerely punish'd you,
2: Your compensation makes amends, for I
3: Have given you here a third of mine own life,
4: Or that for which I live; who once again
5: I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations
6: Were but my trials of thy love and thou
7: Hast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven,
8: I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,
9: Do not smile at me that I boast her off,
10: For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
11: And make it halt behind her.
12: FERDINAND: I do believe it
13: Against an oracle.
14: PROSPERO: Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition
15: Worthily purchased take my daughter: but
16: If thou dost break her virgin-knot before
17: All sanctimonious ceremonies may
18: With full and holy rite be minister'd,
19: No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
20: To make this contract grow: but barren hate,
21: Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew
22: The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
23: That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,
24: As Hymen's lamps shall light you.
25: FERDINAND: As I hope
26: For quiet days, fair issue and long life,
27: With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,
28: The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion.
29: Our worser genius can, shall never melt
30: Mine honour into lust, to take away
31: The edge of that day's celebration
32: When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,
33: Or Night kept chain'd below.
34: PROSPERO: Fairly spoke.
35: Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.
36: What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!
37: ARIEL: What would my potent master? here I am.
38: PROSPERO: Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
39: Did worthily perform; and I must use you
40: In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,
41: O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place:
42: Incite them to quick motion; for I must
43: Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
44: Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,
45: And they expect it from me.
46: ARIEL: Presently?
47: PROSPERO: Ay, with a twink.
48: ARIEL: Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'
49: And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,'
50: Each one, tripping on his toe,
51: Will be here with mop and mow.
52: Do you love me, master? no?
53: PROSPERO: Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approach
54: Till thou dost hear me call.
55: ARIEL: Well, I conceive.
56: PROSPERO: Look thou be true; do not give dalliance
57: Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
58: To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,
59: Or else, good night your vow!
60: FERDINAND: I warrant you sir;
61: The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
62: Abates the ardour of my liver.
63: PROSPERO: Well.
64: Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,
65: Rather than want a spirit: appear and pertly!
66: No tongue! all eyes! be silent.
67: IRIS: Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas
68: Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;
69: Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,
70: And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;
71: Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,
72: Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,
73: To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom -groves,
74: Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
75: Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard;
76: And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
77: Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o' the sky,
78: Whose watery arch and messenger am I,
79: Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,
80: Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
81: To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain:
82: Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.
83: CERES: Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er
84: Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
85: Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
86: Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers,
87: And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
88: My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,
89: Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
90: Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?
91: IRIS: A contract of true love to celebrate;
92: And some donation freely to estate
93: On the blest lovers.
94: CERES: Tell me, heavenly bow,
95: If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,
96: Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot
97: The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,
98: Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company
99: I have forsworn.
100: IRIS: Of her society
101: Be not afraid: I met her deity
102: Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son
103: Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done
104: Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,
105: Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid
106: Till Hymen's torch be lighted: but vain;
107: Mars's hot minion is returned again;
108: Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,
109: Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows
110: And be a boy right out.
111: CERES: High'st queen of state,
112: Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.
113: JUNO: How does my bounteous sister? Go with me
114: To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be
115: And honour'd in their issue.
116: Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,
117: Long continuance, and increasing,
118: Hourly joys be still upon you!
119: Juno sings her blessings upon you.
120: CERES: Earth's increase, foison plenty,
121: Barns and garners never empty,
122: Vines and clustering bunches growing,
123: Plants with goodly burthen bowing;
124: Spring come to you at the farthest
125: In the very end of harvest!
126: Scarcity and want shall shun you;
127: Ceres' blessing so is on you.
128: FERDINAND: This is a most majestic vision, and
129: Harmoniously charmingly. May I be bold
130: To think these spirits?
131: PROSPERO: Spirits, which by mine art
132: I have from their confines call'd to enact
133: My present fancies.
134: FERDINAND: Let me live here ever;
135: So rare a wonder'd father and a wife
136: Makes this place Paradise.
137: PROSPERO: Sweet, now, silence!
138: Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;
139: There's something else to do: hush, and be mute,
140: Or else our spell is marr'd.
141: IRIS: You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks,
142: With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,
143: Leave your crisp channels and on this green land
144: Answer your summons; Juno does command:
145: Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate
146: A contract of true love; be not too late.
147: You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,
148: Come hither from the furrow and be merry:
149: Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on
150: And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
151: In country footing.
152: PROSPERO: [Aside] I had forgot that foul conspiracy
153: Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
154: Against my life: the minute of their plot
155: Is almost come.
156: Well done! avoid; no more!
157: FERDINAND: This is strange: your father's in some passion
158: That works him strongly.
159: MIRANDA: Never till this day
160: Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.
161: PROSPERO: You do look, my son, in a moved sort,
162: As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.
163: Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
164: As I foretold you, were all spirits and
165: Are melted into air, into thin air:
166: And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
167: The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
168: The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
169: Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve
170: And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
171: Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
172: As dreams are made on, and our little life
173: Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;
174: Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled:
175: Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:
176: If you be pleased, retire into my cell
177: And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,
178: To still my beating mind.
179: MIRANDA: We wish your peace.
180: PROSPERO: Come with a thought I thank thee, Ariel: come.
181: ARIEL: Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?
182: PROSPERO: Spirit,
183: We must prepare to meet with Caliban.
184: ARIEL: Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,
185: I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd
186: Lest I might anger thee.
187: PROSPERO: Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?
188: ARIEL: I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;
189: So fun of valour that they smote the air
190: For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
191: For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
192: Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;
193: At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd
194: their ears,
195: Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses
196: As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears
197: That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through
198: Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,
199: Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them
200: I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,
201: There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake
202: O'erstunk their feet.
203: PROSPERO: This was well done, my bird.
204: Thy shape invisible retain thou still:
205: The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,
206: For stale to catch these thieves.
207: ARIEL: I go, I go.
208: PROSPERO: A devil, a born devil, on whose nature
209: Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
210: Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
211: And as with age his body uglier grows,
212: So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,
213: Even to roaring.
214: Come, hang them on this line.
215: CALIBAN: Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not
216: Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.
217: STEPHANO: Monster, your fairy, which you say is
218: a harmless fairy, has done little better than
219: played the Jack with us.
220: TRINCULO: Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at
221: which my nose is in great indignation.
222: STEPHANO: So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take
223: a displeasure against you, look you,--
224: TRINCULO: Thou wert but a lost monster.
225: CALIBAN: Good my lord, give me thy favour still.
226: Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to
227: Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.
228: All's hush'd as midnight yet.
229: TRINCULO: Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--
230: STEPHANO: There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,
231: monster, but an infinite loss.
232: TRINCULO: That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your
233: harmless fairy, monster.
234: STEPHANO: I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears
235: for my labour.
236: CALIBAN: Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,
237: This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.
238: Do that good mischief which may make this island
239: Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,
240: For aye thy foot-licker.
241: STEPHANO: Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.
242: TRINCULO: O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look
243: what a wardrobe here is for thee!
244: CALIBAN: Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.
245: TRINCULO: O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery.
246: O king Stephano!
247: STEPHANO: Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll have
248: that gown.
249: TRINCULO: Thy grace shall have it.
250: CALIBAN: The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean
251: To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone
252: And do the murder first: if he awake,
253: From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,
254: Make us strange stuff.
255: STEPHANO: Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line,
256: is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under
257: the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your
258: hair and prove a bald jerkin.
259: TRINCULO: Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace.
260: STEPHANO: I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't:
261: wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this
262: country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent
263: pass of pate; there's another garment for't.
264: TRINCULO: Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and
265: away with the rest.
266: CALIBAN: I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,
267: And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes
268: With foreheads villanous low.
269: STEPHANO: Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this
270: away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you
271: out of my kingdom: go to, carry this.
272: TRINCULO: And this.
273: STEPHANO: Ay, and this.
274: PROSPERO: Hey, Mountain, hey!
275: ARIEL: Silver I there it goes, Silver!
276: PROSPERO: Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!
277: Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
278: With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews
279: With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them
280: Than pard or cat o' mountain.
281: ARIEL: Hark, they roar!
ACT 5 SCENE 1

1: PROSPERO: Now does my project gather to a head:
2: My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time
3: Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?
4: ARIEL: On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,
5: You said our work should cease.
6: PROSPERO: I did say so,
7: When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,
8: How fares the king and's followers?
9: ARIEL: Confined together
10: In the same fashion as you gave in charge,
11: Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,
12: In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;
13: They cannot budge till your release. The king,
14: His brother and yours, abide all three distracted
15: And the remainder mourning over them,
16: Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly
17: Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'
18: His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
19: From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em
20: That if you now beheld them, your affections
21: Would become tender.
22: PROSPERO: Dost thou think so, spirit?
23: ARIEL: Mine would, sir, were I human.
24: PROSPERO: And mine shall.
25: Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling
26: Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
27: One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,
28: Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?
29: Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,
30: Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury
31: Do I take part: the rarer action is
32: In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,
33: The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
34: Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:
35: My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,
36: And they shall be themselves.
37: ARIEL: I'll fetch them, sir.
38: PROSPERO: Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,
39: And ye that on the sands with printless foot
40: Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
41: When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
42: By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
43: Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime
44: Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
45: To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,
46: Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd
47: The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
48: And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault
49: Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder
50: Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak
51: With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory
52: Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up
53: The pine and cedar: graves at my command
54: Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth
55: By my so potent art. But this rough magic
56: I here abjure, and, when I have required
57: Some heavenly music, which even now I do,
58: To work mine end upon their senses that
59: This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
60: Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
61: And deeper than did ever plummet sound
62: I'll drown my book.
63: A solemn air and the best comforter
64: To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
65: Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
66: For you are spell-stopp'd.
67: Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
68: Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,
69: Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
70: And as the morning steals upon the night,
71: Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
72: Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
73: Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
74: My true preserver, and a loyal sir
75: To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces
76: Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
77: Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:
78: Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
79: Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
80: You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
81: Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,
82: Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,
83: Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,
84: Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
85: Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
86: Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
87: That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
88: That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,
89: Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:
90: I will discase me, and myself present
91: As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;
92: Thou shalt ere long be free.
93: Where the bee sucks. there suck I:
94: In a cowslip's bell I lie;
95: There I couch when owls do cry.
96: On the bat's back I do fly
97: After summer merrily.
98: Merrily, merrily shall I live now
99: Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
100: Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:
101: But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.
102: To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:
103: There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
104: Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain
105: Being awake, enforce them to this place,
106: And presently, I prithee.
107: ARIEL: I drink the air before me, and return
108: Or ere your pulse twice beat.
109: GONZALO: All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement
110: Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us
111: Out of this fearful country!
112: PROSPERO: Behold, sir king,
113: The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:
114: For more assurance that a living prince
115: Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;
116: And to thee and thy company I bid
117: A hearty welcome.
118: ALONSO: Whether thou best he or no,
119: Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,
120: As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse
121: Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,
122: The affliction of my mind amends, with which,
123: I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
124: An if this be at all, a most strange story.
125: Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat
126: Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero
127: Be living and be here?
128: PROSPERO: First, noble friend,
129: Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot
130: Be measured or confined.
131: GONZALO: Whether this be
132: Or be not, I'll not swear.
133: PROSPERO: You do yet taste
134: Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you
135: Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!
136: But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,
137: I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you
138: And justify you traitors: at this time
139: I will tell no tales.
140: SEBASTIAN: [Aside] The devil speaks in him.
141: PROSPERO: No.
142: For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother
143: Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive
144: Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require
145: My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,
146: Thou must restore.
147: ALONSO: If thou be'st Prospero,
148: Give us particulars of thy preservation;
149: How thou hast met us here, who three hours since
150: Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--
151: How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
152: My dear son Ferdinand.
153: PROSPERO: I am woe for't, sir.
154: ALONSO: Irreparable is the loss, and patience
155: Says it is past her cure.
156: PROSPERO: I rather think
157: You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace
158: For the like loss I have her sovereign aid
159: And rest myself content.
160: ALONSO: You the like loss!
161: PROSPERO: As great to me as late; and, supportable
162: To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker
163: Than you may call to comfort you, for I
164: Have lost my daughter.
165: ALONSO: A daughter?
166: O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,
167: The king and queen there! that they were, I wish
168: Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
169: Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?
170: PROSPERO: In this last tempest. I perceive these lords
171: At this encounter do so much admire
172: That they devour their reason and scarce think
173: Their eyes do offices of truth, their words
174: Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have
175: Been justled from your senses, know for certain
176: That I am Prospero and that very duke
177: Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely
178: Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,
179: To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;
180: For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,
181: Not a relation for a breakfast nor
182: Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;
183: This cell's my court: here have I few attendants
184: And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.
185: My dukedom since you have given me again,
186: I will requite you with as good a thing;
187: At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye
188: As much as me my dukedom.
189: MIRANDA: Sweet lord, you play me false.
190: FERDINAND: No, my dear'st love,
191: I would not for the world.
192: MIRANDA: Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,
193: And I would call it, fair play.
194: ALONSO: If this prove
195: A vision of the Island, one dear son
196: Shall I twice lose.
197: SEBASTIAN: A most high miracle!
198: FERDINAND: Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;
199: I have cursed them without cause.
200: ALONSO: Now all the blessings
201: Of a glad father compass thee about!
202: Arise, and say how thou camest here.
203: MIRANDA: O, wonder!
204: How many goodly creatures are there here!
205: How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,
206: That has such people in't!
207: PROSPERO: 'Tis new to thee.
208: ALONSO: What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
209: Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:
210: Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,
211: And brought us thus together?
212: FERDINAND: Sir, she is mortal;
213: But by immortal Providence she's mine:
214: I chose her when I could not ask my father
215: For his advice, nor thought I had one. She
216: Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,
217: Of whom so often I have heard renown,
218: But never saw before; of whom I have
219: Received a second life; and second father
220: This lady makes him to me.
221: ALONSO: I am hers:
222: But, O, how oddly will it sound that I
223: Must ask my child forgiveness!
224: PROSPERO: There, sir, stop:
225: Let us not burthen our remembrance with
226: A heaviness that's gone.
227: GONZALO: I have inly wept,
228: Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,
229: And on this couple drop a blessed crown!
230: For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
231: Which brought us hither.
232: ALONSO: I say, Amen, Gonzalo!
233: GONZALO: Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue
234: Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice
235: Beyond a common joy, and set it down
236: With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage
237: Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,
238: And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife
239: Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom
240: In a poor isle and all of us ourselves
241: When no man was his own.
242: ALONSO: [To FERDINAND and MIRANDA] Give me your hands:
243: Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
244: That doth not wish you joy!
245: GONZALO: Be it so! Amen!
246: O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:
247: I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,
248: This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,
249: That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?
250: Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?
251: Boatswain: The best news is, that we have safely found
252: Our king and company; the next, our ship--
253: Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--
254: Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
255: We first put out to sea.
256: ARIEL: [Aside to PROSPERO] Sir, all this service
257: Have I done since I went.
258: PROSPERO: [Aside to ARIEL] My tricksy spirit!
259: ALONSO: These are not natural events; they strengthen
260: From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?
261: Boatswain: If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
262: I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,
263: And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches;
264: Where but even now with strange and several noises
265: Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
266: And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,
267: We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;
268: Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
269: Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master
270: Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,
271: Even in a dream, were we divided from them
272: And were brought moping hither.
273: ARIEL: [Aside to PROSPERO] Was't well done?
274: PROSPERO: [Aside to ARIEL] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.
275: ALONSO: This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod
276: And there is in this business more than nature
277: Was ever conduct of: some oracle
278: Must rectify our knowledge.
279: PROSPERO: Sir, my liege,
280: Do not infest your mind with beating on
281: The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure
282: Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,
283: Which to you shall seem probable, of every
284: These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful
285: And think of each thing well.
286: Come hither, spirit:
287: Set Caliban and his companions free;
288: Untie the spell.
289: How fares my gracious sir?
290: There are yet missing of your company
291: Some few odd lads that you remember not.
292: STEPHANO: Every man shift for all the rest, and
293: let no man take care for himself; for all is
294: but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!
295: TRINCULO: If these be true spies which I wear in my head,
296: here's a goodly sight.
297: CALIBAN: O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
298: How fine my master is! I am afraid
299: He will chastise me.
300: SEBASTIAN: Ha, ha!
301: What things are these, my lord Antonio?
302: Will money buy 'em?
303: ANTONIO: Very like; one of them
304: Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.
305: PROSPERO: Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
306: Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,
307: His mother was a witch, and one so strong
308: That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,
309: And deal in her command without her power.
310: These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil--
311: For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them
312: To take my life. Two of these fellows you
313: Must know and own; this thing of darkness!
314: Acknowledge mine.
315: CALIBAN: I shall be pinch'd to death.
316: ALONSO: Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?
317: SEBASTIAN: He is drunk now: where had he wine?
318: ALONSO: And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
319: Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?
320: How camest thou in this pickle?
321: TRINCULO: I have been in such a pickle since I
322: saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of
323: my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.
324: SEBASTIAN: Why, how now, Stephano!
325: STEPHANO: O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.
326: PROSPERO: You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?
327: STEPHANO: I should have been a sore one then.
328: ALONSO: This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.
329: PROSPERO: He is as disproportion'd in his manners
330: As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;
331: Take with you your companions; as you look
332: To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.
333: CALIBAN: Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter
334: And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass
335: Was I, to take this drunkard for a god
336: And worship this dull fool!
337: PROSPERO: Go to; away!
338: ALONSO: Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.
339: SEBASTIAN: Or stole it, rather.
340: PROSPERO: Sir, I invite your highness and your train
341: To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
342: For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste
343: With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
344: Go quick away; the story of my life
345: And the particular accidents gone by
346: Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
347: I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,
348: Where I have hope to see the nuptial
349: Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;
350: And thence retire me to my Milan, where
351: Every third thought shall be my grave.
352: ALONSO: I long
353: To hear the story of your life, which must
354: Take the ear strangely.
