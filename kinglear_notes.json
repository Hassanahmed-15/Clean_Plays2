        "Coleridge: The Tragedy, &c.] *Of all Shakespeare’s plays,' says Coleridge, 'Macbeth is the most rapid, Hamlet the slowest, in movement. Lear combines length with rapidity,—like the hurricane and the whirlpool, absorbing while it advances. It begins as a stormy day in summer, with brightness ; but that brightness is lurid, and anticipates the tempest.’",
        "Wright: Albany] Holinshed {Chron, i, fol. 39 b q ed. 1577) gives the fol* lowing account of the origin of this name: ‘The third and last part of the Is|and he allotted vnto Albanacte hys youngest sonne. . . . This later parcel at the first, toke the name of Albanactus, who called it Albania. But now a small portion onely of the Region (beyng vnder the regiment of a Duke) reteyneth the sayd denomination, the reast beyng called Scotlande, of certayne Scottes that came ouer from Ireland to inhabite in those quarters. It is deuided from Loegres also by the Humber, so that Albania as Brute left it, conteyned all the north part of the Island that is to be found beyond the aforesayd streame, vnto the point of Cathenesse.’"

Yet th^ duke^ in this place, seems very unlike Sh.| and equalities is perhaps more in place than “ qualities.” ’",
        "Johnson: division] There is something of obscurity or inaccuracy in this preparatory scene. The king has already divided his kingdom, and yet when he enters he examines his daughters, to discover in what proportion he should divide it. Perhaps Kent and Gloster only were privy to his design, which he still kept in his own hands, to be changed or performed as subsequent reasons should determine him.",
        "Coleridge: division] It was not without forethought, nor is it without its due significance, that the division of Lear’s kingdom is in the first six lines of the play stated as a thing already determined in all its particulars, previously to the trial of professions, as to the relative rewards of which the daughters were to be made to consider their several portions. The strange, yet by no means unnatural, mixture of selfishness, sensibility, and habit of feeling derived from, and fostered by, the particular rank and usages of the individual ;—the intense desire of being intensely beloved,*—selfish, and yet characteristic of the selfishness of a loving and kindly nature alone; the self-supportless leaning for all pleasure on another’s breast;—the craving after sympathy with a prodigal disinterestedness, frustrated by its own ostentation, and the mode and nature of its claims;—the anxiety, the distrust, the jealousy, which more or less accompany all selfish affections, and are amongst the surest contradistinctions of mere fondness from true love, and which originate Lear’s eager wish to enjoy his daughlem’ violent professions, whilst the inveterate habits of sovereignty convert the wish into claim and positive right, and an incompliance with it into crime and treason;—these facts, these passions, these moral verities, on which the whole tragedy is founded, are all prepared for, and will to the retrospect be found implied, in these first four or five lines of the play. They let us know that the trial is but a trick, and that the gi-ossness of the old king’s rage is in part the natural result of a silly trick suddenly and most unexpectedly baffled and disappointed. It may here be worthy of notice that Lear is the only serious performance of Shakespeare, the interest and situations of which are derived from the assumption of a gross improbability; whereas Beaumont and Fletcher’s tragedies are, almost all of them, founded on some out-of-the-way accident or exception to the general experience of mankind. But observe the matchless judgement of our Shakespeare, First, improbable as the conduct of Lear is in the first scene, yet it was an old story rooted in the popular faith,—a thing taken for granted already, and consequently without any of the effects of improbability. Secondly, it is merely the canvas for the characters and passions,— a mere occasion for,—and not, in the manner of Beaumont and Fletcher, perpetually recurring as the cause and sine qua non of,—the incidents and emotions. Let the first scene of this play have been lost, and let it only be understood that a fond father had been duped by hypocritical professions of love and duty on the part of two daughters to disinherit the third, previously, and deservedly, more dear to him • —and all the rest of the tragedy would retain its interest undiminished, and be pei- fectly intelligible. The accidental is nowhere the groundwork of the passions, but that which is catholic, which in all ages has been, and ever will be, close and native to the heart of man,—parental anguish from filial ingratitude, the genuineness of worth, though coffined in bluntness, and the execrable vileness of a smooth iniquity. Perhaps I ought to have added the Merchant of Venice; but here too the same remarks apply. It was an old tale ; and substitute any other danger than that of the pound of flesh (the circumstance in which the improbability lies), yet all the situations and the emotions appertaining to them remain equally excellent and appropriate. Whereas take away from the Mad Lover of Beaumont and Fletcher the fantastic hypothesis of his engagement to cut out his own heart, and have it presented to his mistress, and all the main scenes must go with it.",
        "Hudson: division] The opening thus forecasts Lear’s madness by indicating that dotage has already got the better of his reason and judgment.",
        "Anon (cited by Halliwell): division] Johnson’s note is needless, because ‘ it is clear that Lear’s two councillors, Kent and Gloucester, are talking of the division he has proposed in the secrecy of the council-board, and afterwards he opens his hidden (“darker”) meaning to those whom it concerned (his sons and daughters), before ignorant of it.’",
        "Capell (Notes, &c., vol. i, part ii, p. 140): qualities] ‘Qualities’ appears to be a printer’s corruption ; both as suiting less with the context and as taking something from the passage’s numerousness. [What this ‘ numerousness ’ exactly means I do not know. Capell does not print the passage as verse.]",
        "Schmidt (Zur Textkritik, p. 12): qualities] Equalities cannot be right here ; at best it can but be equality. Equality cannot be predicated of a part by itself, but only of the relationship of parts to each other; it is therefore essentially a singular idea. We cannot say; ‘the equal- ities of the three parts are perfect,’ but only ; ‘ the equality,’ &c.",

        "Wright: moiety] It may be in the present pas- sage the word is used in its literal sense, for it is not clear that Gloucester knew any- thing of Lear’s intention to include Cordelia in the distribution of the kingdom."

        "Capell (Notes, &c. p. 93, 1765) : fast] “Fast” is determined, meant, fixed; King Lear's use of “purpose” and “intent” particularly in these opening lines is Shakespeare’s natural English for “resolution,” “determinate will,” and marks the grave, ceremonial, legal aspect of the transaction occasioned by advancing age.",

        "Crosby (Epitome of Literature, 15 May, 1879): nature] “With merit” I take to be an adverbial phrase equivalent to “deservedly”; and the verb to challenge, in addition to its sense of to contend, or vie with, has an older and less common meaning—viz., to make title to, or claim as due. Chaucer thus uses it, in The Frankelyn’s Tale [488, ed. Morris]: “Nat that I chalenge eny thing of right Of yow, my soverayn lady, but youre grace”; and Joye, Exposicion of Daniel, c. 3 (quoted by Richardson), “God oftentymes by clere examples and bodely delyuerances chalengeth to himself the glorye of his owne name.” In our own poet, too, cf. 3 Hen. VI: III, iii, 86: “all her perfections challenge sovereignty;” IV, vi, 6 : “Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;” IV, viii, 48 : “These graces challenge grace;” and Oth., I, iii, 188: “So much I challenge that I may profess due to the Moor, my lord”—i. e, claim as my right. Giving then this meaning to “challenge,” the passage may be properly paraphrased, “where your natural relation to, and love for, me claim my bounty, by deserving it; or, in other words, ‘that I may extend my largest bounty where your natural affection deservedly claims it as due!' There is no contention or challenge between ‘nature’ and ‘merit,’ in which the king’s bounty is to be the prize ; he offers it solely to ‘nature,’ claiming or demanding it on its own deserts.”",
        "Ulrici (p. 443): nature] These words cannot possibly have been meant seriously ; for apart from the circumstance that they contradict the facts adduced, Lear himself does not act in accordance with them, but does the very opposite. . . . Obviously, therefore, the whole demand was but a freak of the imagination, which Lear did not mean to take into serious consideration, but which it occurred to him to make merely to fill up the time till the return of Gloucester, who had been despatched to fetch the duke of Burgundy and the king of France, The concealed motive of this freak, and its execution, was probably Lear’s wish,—by an open and public assurance of his daughters’ love and piety,—to convince himself that his abdication could be of no danger to himself, and that doubts about its propriety were unfounded.",
        "Bucknill (p. 174): nature] That the trial is a mere trick is unquestionable ; but is not the significance of this fact greater than Coleridge suspected? Does it not lead us to conclude that from the first the king’s mind is off its balance; that the partition of his kingdom, involving inevitable feuds and wars, is the first act of his developing insanity ; and that the manner of its partition, the mock-trial of his daughters’ affections, and its tragical denouement is the second, and but the second, act of his madness.",
        "Moberly: Goneril] This name seems to be derived from “Gwenar,” the British form of Vener (Venus). Regan is probably of the same origin as “Rience,” in the Holy Grail; “reian” meaning in the Cornish “to give bounteously.”"

        "Mr. Smith (ap. Grey’s Notes, &c., 1754, ii, 102): square of sense] thinks that 'sense’ should be senses; because there were two squares referred to by Goneril ; the first was eye- sight, space, liberty, and what could be valued rich and rare; the second square is grace, health, beauty, honour. “But then Goneril says she loves the king no less than these, and consequently she loves these as much as she does the king. And this is the point in which Regan says she falls short of her. The second square is of the superlative kind of joys, and Regan professes herself an enemy to three of the joys, viz. health, beauty, and honour; which are, of all the other joys, the most precious square of sense (i. e. sense’s joys) possesses ; and declares that his dear Highness’ love is the only joy of the square which she values. In this it is plain that she outdoes her sister Goneril.” [I think that is worth transcribing as a curiosity. Ed.]",

He himself says, the phrase in question means the “choicest symmetry of reason, the most normal and intelligent mode of thinking.” Regan’s love is so great that she will know nothing of all joys, which even a pattern of reason professes to be joys, such as, “eye-sight, space, liberty, life, grace, health, beauty, and honour,” which had just been extolled by her pattern sister.",

        "White: ponderous] “More ponderous” of the Ff may possibly be a misprint for “more precious!” Wright thinks it “has the appearance of being a player’s correction to avoid a piece of imaginary bad grammar;” but I do not think we should desert a durior lectio but for a reason ‘more ponderous’ than this.",
        "Schmidt (ad he.): ponderous] says, with shrewdness, “Light was the usual term applied to a wanton, frivolous, and fickle love ; ‘light o’ love’ was a proverbial expression. But the opposite of this, heavy could not be here employed, because that means uniformly, in a moral sense, melancholy, sad; nor is weighs any better; therefore Sh. chose ‘ponderous,’ ”",

        "Dyce: last and least] pronounces the reading of Ff, “last and least” a flagrant error; and Staunton says it can scarcely be doubted that it is a misprint, and to the examples already given and referred to, adds the following: “The last, not least, of these brave brethren” — Peck’s Polyhymnia, “Though I speak last, my lord, I am not least”—Middleton’s Mayor of Queenborough I, iii. And “my last is, and not least,”—Beau, & FL, Monsieur Thomas III, i.",
        "White: last and least] Plainly this passage was rewritten before the Folio was printed. The last part of line 82, as it appears in the Qq, shows that the figurative allusion to the king of France and the duke of Burgundy could have formed no part of the passage when that text was printed. And in the rewriting there was a happy change made from the commonplace of “last not least,” to an allusion to the personal traits and family position of Cordelia. The impression produced by all the passages in which she appears or is referred to is, that she was her father’s little pet, while her sisters were big, bold, brazen beauties. Afterwards, in this very scene, Lear says of her to Burgundy: “If aught within that little seeming substance, or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,” &c. When she is dead, too, her father, although an infirm old man, “fourscore and upward,” carries her body in his arms. Cordelia was evidently the least, as well as the youngest and best beloved, of the old king’s daughters; and therefore he says to her, “Now our joy, what can you say to justify my intention of giving you the richest third of the kingdom, although you are the youngest born and the least royal in your presence?” The poet’s every touch upon the figure of Cordelia paints her as, with all her firmness of character, a creature to nestle in a man’s bosom,—her father’s or her husband’s, and to be cherished almost like a little child; and this happy afterthought brings the picture into perfect keeping, and at the very commencement of the drama impresses upon the mind a characteristic trait of a personage who plays an important part in it, although she is little seen.",
        "Hudson: last and least] I find it not easy to stand out against White’s argument in favour of the Ff; still, the phrase “though last, not least,” appears to have been so much a favorite with the poet, and 'withal so good in itself^ that I feel constrained to read with the majority of the editors.",
        "Schmidt (Zur Textkritik des King Lear, p. 13): last and least] In following out his theory that in the Qq we have merely a corrupt text taken down from the stage representation, repudiates the “last, not least,” here, and shrewdly suggests that since the same phrase occurs in Jul. Caes. III, i, 189, the actor who took the part of Antony in that play also acted Lear, and the phrase once learned by heart was repeated by him in Lear, where it does not belong. “But let one put himself in the place of Lear, and there will be felt in this ‘last and least’ a tender touch of Nature. Our unser Letztes und Kleinstes gives the meaning certainly, but not quite wholly ; ‘least’ means the youngest child, because there had been less of formal ado made over her, because in many a fête and state occasion, in which the elder sisters took part, she had not had any share, and yet was the joy and ‘object’ of her father, as the youngest child is always the favorite of the father, the eldest of the mother.” [If Hudson finds it not easy to stand out against White’s argument, I find it impossible. White is at his happiest in detecting subtle, delicate touches, and when, as in this instance, he is in accord with the Folio, I yield at once, and will merely add that if Malone and Staunton can prove that “last, not least,” was a hackneyed phrase in Shakespeare’s time, it is all the more reason why it should not be used here. Its very opposition to the common use and wont makes it emphatic.—Ed.]",

        "Steevens: interess’d] So in the Preface of Drayton’s Polyolbion: “—there is scarce any of the nobilitie or gentry of this land, but he is in some way or other by his blood interessed therein.” Again in Jonson’s Sejanus III, i: “The dear republic, our sacred laws, and just authority are interess’d therein.” Wright: For the form of the word, see Cotgrave (Fr. Dict.): “Interessé . . . Interessed, or touched in; dishonoured, hurt, or hindered by,” &c. See also Massinger, The Duke of Milan, I, i : “The wars so long continued between The emperor Charles, and Francis the French king, Have interess’d in either’s cause the most Of the Italian princes.” And Florio (Ital. Dict.): “Interessare, to interesse, to touch or concerae a mans maine state or fee-simple, to conceme a mans reputation;” and “Interessato, interessed, touched in state, in honour or reputation.” Again in Minsheu (Span. Dict.): “Interessado, m. interessed, hauing right in.” For other instances of verbs of which the participial form has become a new verb, compare “graff,” “hoise,” which appear in modern speech as “graft,” “hoist.” Schmidt maintains that “interest” of the Ff is the contracted past participle interested, formed on the analogy of “felicitate,” line 73, &c., and that there is no such verb as interesse or interest in Sh."

        "Coleridge: Nothing] There is something of disgust at the ruthless hypocrisy of her sisters, and some little faulty admixture of pride and sullenness in Cordelia’s “Nothing;” and her tone is well contrived, indeed, to lessen the glaring absurdity of Lear’s conduct, but answers the yet more important purpose of forcing away the attention from the nursery- tale the moment it has served its end, that of supplying the canvas for the picture. This is also materially furthered by Kent’s opposition, which displays Lear’s moral incapability of resigning the sovereign power in the very act of disposing of it, Kent is, perhaps, the nearest to perfect goodness in all Shakespeare’s characters, and yet the most individualized. There is an extraordinary charm in his bluntness, which is that only of a nobleman, arising from a contempt of overstrained courtesy, and combined with easy placability where goodness of heart is apparent. His passionate affection for, and fidelity to, Lear act on our feelings in Lear’s own favour ; virtue seems to be in company with him."

        "W. W. Lloyd: bond] The crudity of manners expressed in Lear’s solicitation of flattery has its natural counterpart in the almost sullen and repulsive tone of the virtue which preserves Cordelia from the degradation he would tempt her to. The progress of the story required a reply that should provoke the indignation of her father, and yet not cause her to forfeit our esteem. . . . Moreover, Sh., it appears to me, designed to convey, by the very terms and rhythm of the speeches of Cordelia, an impression that her speech was usually reserved and low and laconic, and thus that the very faculty was foreign to her that might have enabled her to effect the same result for her own dignity with milder method. Certain it is, and it is sufficiently declared in the sequel of the scene, that she took too little thought for the fact that her disinheriting was a greater misfortune to her father than to herself, and that to prevent it for his sake were worth incurring some misconstruction; this thought necessarily arises from the terms in which she commends her father, whose weakness she had not had the skill to humour honorably, to the sisters, whose natures she knows too well not to foresee their course, even without the irritation which the same weakness was sure to give occasion and welcome pretext for. This, then, is the incongruity of the social state on which the tragic action of the play depends; and when Lear enters mad in the last scene, with Cordelia dead in his arms, we have but the fulfilment for either of the fate they equally provoked ; we behold the common catastrophe of affection too much qualified by unreasonable anger on one side, and unaccommodating rigour on the other.",
        "Rapp (Einleitung zur Uebersetzung, Stuttgart, 1843): Cordelia] Elder sisters are vulgar, selfish natures; Cordelia is not so vulgar, although possessed of a pride and obstinacy not unusual. When Diogenes marched up and down in the brilliant rooms of Plato, saying: \"I tread upon the pride of Plato,” “Yes,” replied Plato, “with greater pride.” That is just the case with Cordelia. She is proud of being in the right, in contrast with her vulgar sisters, and this feeling she opposes to her sisters and to her old father. The weak old father has a right to a few flattering expressions from a loving child, because he needs them. She offers him, on the contrary, what he cannot bear, the truth. A woman, whose nature is love, and who is straitlaced for truth, is a doubly perverted creature. Truth and Love are completely antipodal; what else is love for an individual but the taking of a finite object for an infinite, and worshipping it as such? Thus, love is essentially a lie, not a truth, and Cordelia misbehaves like her sisters, only in a different way, by egoism and lovelessness. One for whom she cannot tell a little lie, she does not love as she should. On this fine ground, which the poet has laid very close to us, now rests the whole piece.",

Wright is also, apparently, of this opinion; but Moberly says that the plural \"are” is used by attraction to the word “duties,” as in Hen. V: V, ii, 18; and that the phrase should be “as is right fit,” as, indeed, Keightley had already so printed it in his text."

Which our nature cannot bear, nor our place, without departure from the potency of that place. This is easy and clear. Lear, who is characterized as hot, heady, and violent, is, with very just observation of life, made to entangle himself with vows, upon any sudden provocation to vow revenge, and then to plead the obligation of a vow in defence of implacability. Steevens: In my opinion, ‘made’ is right. Lear had just delegated his power to Albany and Cornwall, contenting himself with only the name and all the additions of a king. He could, therefore, have no power to inflict on Kent the punishment which he thought he deserved. ‘Our potency made good’ seems to me only this: They to whom I have yielded my power and authority, yielding me the ability to dispense it in this instance, take thy reward. Malone: The meaning, I think is; As a proof that I am not a mere threatener, that I have power as well as will to punish, take the due reward of thy demerits; hear thy sentence. The words ‘our potency made good’ are in the absolute case. Wright; Lear still speaks as king, although he had announced his intention of abdicating. It is difficult, therefore, to understand why Steevens should have stumbled at this passage.

Now, Lear was fallen into taint, i.e. his judgement was corrupted, in preferring the extravagant and lying protestations of his eldest daughters to the sincere and just ones of his youngest. And if we juminate a little, this is the only second reason for Lear’s rejecting Cordelia that can with any probability be supposed to be guessed at by France; for it would be rude in France to charge Lear with vouching the dearest affections to one he did not really love; and it is absurd to suppose that so great a love should change to hate, without she had committed some very great crime, and which France could not be brought to believe; therefore, this second guess becomes the only one, and the true one, viz: that Regan and Goneril had, by their superior art in coaxing, won all Lear’s love from Cordelia, Malone held to this interpretation until he ‘recollected that France had not heard the extravagant professions made by Regan and Goneril.’ Then he gives what seems to me the true construction of the passage; ‘Either her offence must be monstrous, or, if she has not committed any such offence, the affection which you always professed to have for her must be tainted and decayed’ [that is, ‘must he’ is to be understood before ‘ Fall’n.’ It is easy to see how the text of the Ff arose. The last syllable of Fnllen was absorbed by the first syllable of ‘into,’ so that even were JFall of the Ff to be adopted, I think it should be printed JFall^-Fjy.]"

The copyist or the compositor miswrote or misread nor other murther. Blackwoods Maga. (Oct. 1853, p. 434): France has just before said: ‘Sure her offence must be of such unnatural degree That monsters it’—that is, it can be nothing short of some crime of the deepest dye, and therefore ‘murder’ does not seem to be so much out of place in the mouth of Cordelia, White pronounces this emendation ‘only specious; for ‘‘vicious blot” is altogether too general a term to be put in the alternative with “foulness,” almost as general, and of like meaning. I do not doubt that Sh. wrote “murther.” ’ [In his Shakespeare, Scholar, White gave in his adherence to Collier’s emendation, saying that ‘msixther is an easy and undeniable mistake for nor other and that ‘murder’ has no proper place in the category of blemishes enumerated by Cordelia.] Walker (Crit, iii, 275): What has murder to do here? Read umber, Malone on ‘umbered face,’ Hen, V: IV, Chorus: ‘Umber is a dark yellow earth brought from Umbria in Italy, which, being mixed with water, produces such a dusky yellow colour as the gleam of fire by night gives to the countenance. Our author’s profession probably furnished him with this epithet; for, from an old MS play, entitled The Telltale, it appears that U7nber was used in the stage exhibitions of his time. In that piece, one of the marginal directions is ! “ He umbers her face.” Dyce (ed. 2): Undoubtedly the original reading is a very suspicious one. Halliwell: Most readers will agree with Dyce. Bailey (ii, 89) proposes burden, because [Heaven save the mark!] the ‘burden of guilt, the burden of dishonour, the burden of sorrow, are all Shakespearian expressions.’ Staunton: Collier’s (MS) emendation is certainly a very plausible substitution. Keightley: How could the pure and gentle Cordelia suppose herself to be suspected of murder? which, moreover, accords not with the other charges she enumerates. I feel strongly persuaded that Sh.’s word was misdeed, which, if a little eflfaced, might easily be taken for ‘murder.’ Hudson: Murder seems a strange word to be used here, and Collier’s reading has some claims to preference; but I suspect Cordelia purposely uses murder out of place, as a glance at the hyperbolical absurdity of denouncing her as ‘a wretch whom Nature is ashamed to acknowledge.’ Moberly: There seems good reason for adopting Collier’s reading: the gradation ‘vicious blot, murder, foulness’ would not be happy. Moreover, from the parallel expression, ‘vicious mole of nature,’ in Ham, I, iv, 24? we may conclude that in this line Cordelia refers to natural defects, which Lear might be supposed to have just discovered; but in the next line: ‘No unchaste action,’ &c., to evil actions, from all suspicions of which she wishes to be cleared. [If ever emendation be necessary, here seems to be the occasion. Rather than suppose that Cordelia could be accused of murder, I would adopt Walkers fax- fetched ‘umber’ or Keightley’s prosaic ‘misdeed.’ Instead, we have what is to me an emendatio certissima, restoring the rhythm, according with the ductus literarum, and offering no violence to the consistency of Cordelia’s character. To White’s objection, which seems to me the only serious one, that there is not enough of an alternative between ‘blot’ and ‘foulness,’ may there not be opposed that Cordelia’s distress might make her verge on incoherence? As Moberly truly says, “the gradation from a vicious blot to murder, and then to foulness, is not happy.” This alone is so un-Shakespearian that of itself it would taint the line. Murder may have been a much less heinous crime in Shakespeare’s days than at present, and Lady Capulet may have thought to cheer Juliet’s drooping spirits with the contemplation of Romeo’s assassination, but that it could ever have been of less degree than foulness demands a faith that reason without miracle can never plant in me. Can a parallel instance of anticlimax be found in Sh.? And mark how admirably the lines are balanced: “vicious blot or foulness, unchaste action or dishonour’d step.”—Ed.]",
        "Wright: But even for want] Wright: The construction is imperfect, though the sense is clear. We should have expected ‘even the want,’ as Hanmer reads, but Sh. was probably guided by what he had written in the line preceding, and mentally supplied ‘I am deprived.’ There is an obscurity about ‘for which.’ It would naturally mean ‘for having which,’ but here it must signify ‘for wanting which.’",

Heath ; Sh. might have written : ‘the want that you have wasted,’ i.e., you will deserve to want that which you have yourself so wastefully and unnecessarily thrown away. Tollet : ‘You are well deserving of the want of dower that you are without.’ Jennens: The old reading is not elegant, indeed, but it is intelligible,—it is like ‘seeding seed’—Gen, i. 29. Capell; The Qq reading, with this addition, viz: 'are worth to want the 'worth that you have wanted' has a plain sense, and one worthy the utterer, and gives a roundness to the jingle. Eccles : It might be read: ‘worth to want that you have wanted,’— 'that' taken demonstratively, and not relatively,—or else, ‘the want of that you have wanted.’ Wright ; Dr. Badham combined the texts of Ff and Qq thus; 'And well are worthy want that worth have wanted.' The difficulty seems to arise from the imperfect connection of the relative with its antecedent. The use of the word 'want' has, apparently, the effect of always making Shakespeare’s constructions obscure. See line 229, Goneril says ‘you have come short in your obedience, and well deserve the want of that affection in which you yourself have been wanting,' Otherwise [with Jennens], we must regard 'the want that you have wanted' as an instance of the combination of a verb with its cognate accusative [which is the view Schmidt takes]. Moberly; The text of the Qq might be emended thus; ‘Which well were worth the word that you have wanted,’ i.e., yet obedience might have claimed from you the one word which you would not say."

Schmidt (Zur Textkritik, p. 15) earnestly contends, but I am afraid in vain, for ‘sit’ of the Ff. ‘To strike together,’ he says, ‘or to act in harmony, as it is expressed by “to hit together,” is not a matter of free will, but proceeds directly from the nature of things, and is not something to which one can be invited. . . . Whereas, the phrase “sit together,” has the plain and manifest meaning—to hold a session, to take counsel together. Goneril would forthwith see a common plan agreed upon, and to Regan’s dilatory answer: “We shall think further of it,” replies: “We must do something, and i’ th’ heat,” and for this an agreement is of course essential, and an agreement she demands in the words ‘Let us sit together.”’ Schmidt then adduces the following instances in proof: Twelfth Night, I, v, 143; Nam. V, i, 4; Hen. V: V, ii. 80; Rich. Ill: III, i, 173; Cor, V, ii, 74; Ib. V, iii, 13 1; Per. II, iii, 92.

To contradict Warburton’s assertion yet more strongly, Edmund concludes this very speech by an invocation to heaven. Mason: Edmund calls ‘ nature ’ his ‘ goddess ’ for the same reason that we call a bastard a natural son,—one who, according to the law of nature, is the child of his father, but according to that of civil society is nullius filius, COLERIDGE : In this speech of Edmund you see as soon as a man cannot reconcile himself to reason, how his conscience flies off by way of appeal to Nature, who is sure upon such occasions never to find fault, and also how shame sharpens a predisposition in the heart to evil. For it is a profound moral, that shame will naturally generate guilt; the oppressed will be vindictive, like Shylock, and in the anguish of undeserved ignominy the delusion secretly springs up, of getting over the moral quality of an action by fixing the mind on the mere physical act alone."

[These notes are given as instances of the amenities that help to make the early comments on Sh. so full of ‘ sweetness and light.’ Ed.] Capell, referring to this emendation of Edwards, says, that ‘it appear’d in the Canons into which it was receiv’d from this editor (together with other communications concerning readings of copies) by that ingenious work’s writer: This emendation will have no impugners or doubters. If that corruption be look’d upon out of which it arose; if it’s opposition to “ base ” be consider’d, and (which is yet a stronger matter than either) it’s connection with “ grow,” which has no natural introduction unless preceded by “ top,” ’ Jennens : If conjecture he made without any regard to the traces of the letters, out or rout are better than be. Malone : In Devonshire, as Sir Joshua Reynolds informs me, ‘ to toe a thing up is to tear it up by the roots ; in which sense the word is perhaps used here, for Edmund immediately adds grow, I prosper.” ’ Delius thus vindicates Rowe’si reading, which he follows : ‘ The Bastard, if his plan succeed, will to the legitimate— What he will inflict upon him he does not say \\ he is interrupted by the entrance of his father, at the mere sight of whom he exclaims, in tones of assured victory, “ I grcp, I prosper.” ’ [For other instances of the use of this word in the same sense see Schmidt’s Lex.’] Nichols {Notes, See., No. 2, p. 9) follows the Ff, and interprets : ‘ Shall advance to, or take the place of, the legitimate.’"

And the king gone tonight ? subscribed his power ? Confined to exhibition? All this done upon the gad I’ (lines 23-26). But Eccles says that Sh. was liable to ‘unhappy oversights’ of dramatic probability, and this must be one; ‘these obnoxious lines,’ therefore, he cuts out and ‘ degrades ’ to the bottom of the page, begging forgiveness for the act, on the ground that he is * in pursuit of a favorite object which is essential to the reasonableness and consistency of this admirable drama; more especially as the lines in themselves are of small importance, and the only ones so treated ’ by him."

The expression is not exactly what might have been expected from Gloucester; we might wish for a word a little less tame when applied to an event which so greatly excites him, but it is perfectly intelligible.’ From the expression < Prescribe not us our duties,’ I, i, 275, Schmidt infers that ‘ prescribe ’ need not of necessity be followed by ‘ to,’ and thus Sh. might have used the passive form ‘ we are prescribed our duties.’ If this be so, then he conjectures that we might punctuate these lines differently; ^ And the king gone to-night ? prescribed ? his power Confined to exhibition ?’ [Dr. Schmidt failed to note that the ‘to’ is not really absent in* Prescribe not us our duties,’ but is simply absorbed in the preceding * not.’ In his edition of this play he goes even further, and says that we are nowhere justified (not even in III, vii, 64) in interpreting * to subscribe ’ by to yield, to surrender, or to submit.

A father “ that so tenderly and entirely loves” his son, but, like Gloucester, condemns him unheard, and drives him forth to misery, is a miscreant in the drama as well as in real life. ... If there be any’single trait which is characteristic of this scene, as well as of the similar first scene of the second Act, it is that not a word of sympathy and warmth for his sons falls from the lips of Gloucester. His levity, when talking with Kent in the very first scene of the play, sufficiently betrays the superficial sense of his marital and parental duties. Only when Edgar is as though dead to him, and the fate of Lear begins to cast its dark shadow over himself (III, vi), does something of fatherly feeling awaken at the thought of his son, hunted through the land. Hitherto, he is indifferent and heartless. Evidently his sons have never stood near to his heart ; he knows them not,—nor what might be expected from either the one or the other. That Edmund, before the time when the action of the play begins, has been “out” nine years in foreign parts is expressly mentioned, and in one way or another Edgar has been equally a stranger .... and is no more to him than Edmund,—“ no deai’er in my account,” i, e. is of as little account. He has sons and they must be acknowledged, and therein he has done his part. Such and no other is the idea that Sh. would have us form of Gloucester, and therefore he could never have written the words : “ To his father that so tenderly and entirely loves him.” They stand in contradiction to all that precedes and follows. They are doubtless an addition made by some sensational actor, and they crept into the Qq through some copyist or reporter.’"

        "Warburton: foppery] In Shakespeare’s best plays, besides the vices that arise from the subject, there is generally some peculiar prevailing folly, principally ridiculed, that runs through the whole piece. Thus, in The Tempest, the lying disposition of travellers, and in As You Like It, the fantastick humour of courtiers are exposed and satirized with infinite pleasantry. In like manner, in this play of Lear, the dotages of judicial astrology ate severely ridiculed. I fancy, was the date of its first performance well considered, it would be found that something or other happened at that time which gave a more than ordinary run to this deceit, as these words seem to intimate: ‘I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day, what should follow these eclipses.’ However this he, an impious cheat, which had so little foundation in nature or reason, so detestable an original, and such fatal consequences on the manners of the people, who were at that time strangely besotted with it, certainly deserved the severest lash of satire. It was a fundamental in this noble science, that whatever seeds of good dispositions the infant unborn might be endowed with, either from nature, or traductively from its parents, yet if, at the time of its birth, the delivery was by any casualty so accelerated or retarded as to fall in with the predominancy of a malignant constellation, that momentary influence would entirely change its nature, and bias it to all the contrary ill qualities. So wretched and monstrous an opinion did it set out with. But the Italians, to whom we owe this, as well as most other unnatural crimes and follies of these latter ages, fomented its onginal impiety to the most detestable height of extravagance. Petrus Aponensis, an Italian physician- of the 13th century, assures us that those prayers which are made to God when the moon is in conjunction with Jupiter in the Dragon’s tail, are infallibly heard. ... The great Milton, with a just indignation of this impiety, hath, in Paradise Regained (Book IV, 383), satirized it in a very beautiful manner, by putting these reveries into the mouth of the devil. ... Nor could the licentious Rabelais himself forbear to ridicule this impious dotage, which he does with exquisite address and humour, where in the fable which he so agreeably tells from iEsop of the man who applied to Jupiter for the loss of his hatchet, he makes those who, on the poor man’s good success, had projected to trick Jupiter by the same petition, a kind of astrologic atheists, who ascribed this good fortune that they imagined they were now all going to partake of, to the influence of some rare conjunction and configuration of the stars. ‘ Hen, hen, dirent ilz—Et doneques telle est au temps present la revolution des Cieulx, la constellation des Astres, et aspect des Planetes, que quiconques coingnee perdra soubdain deuiendra ainsi riche?’ Nou, Frol, du IV Livre.—But to return to Sh, So blasphemous a delusion, therefore, it became the honesty of our poet to expose. But it was a tender point, and required managing. For this impious juggle had in his time a kind of religious reverence paid to it. It was therefore to be done obliquely; and the circumstances of the scene furnished him as good an opportunity as he could wish. The persons in the drama are all Pagans, so that as, in compliance to custom, his good characters were not to speak ill of judicial astrology, they could on account of their religion give no reputation to it. But in order to expose it the more, he with great judgement makes these Pagans fatalists, as appears by these words of Lear, ‘ By all the operations of the orbs, From whom we do exist and cease to be.’^ For the doctrine of fate is the true foundation of judicial astrology. Having thus discredited it by the very commendations given to it, he was in no danger of having his direct satire against it mistaken, by its being put (as he was obliged, both in paying regard to custom and in following nature) into the mouth of the villain and atheist, especially when he has added such force of reason to his ridicule, in the words referred to in the beginning of the note. COLERIDGE : Thus scorn and misanthropy are often the anticipations and mouthpieces of wisdom in the detection of superstitions. Both individuals and nations may be free from such prejudices by being below them, as well as by rising above them.",

The monkish writers on music say ; mi contra fa est diabolus : the interval fa mi, including a tritonus, or sharp 4th, consisting of three tones without the intervention of a semitone, expressed in the modern scale by the letters f G A B, would form a musical phrase extremely disagreeable to the ear. Edmund, speaking of eclipses as portents and prodigies, compares the dislocation of events, the times being out of joint, to the unnatural and offensive sounds, < fa sol la mi.* White: According to modern Italian solmization, fa sol la si; i, e, a progression through the interval of a fourth, ending upon the seventh or leading note of the scale; which, unless followed by the tonic, or used for some very special effect, is a most distracting figure, based upon the most poignant of discords. In Shakespeare’s time, and until a comparatively recent date, the syllables for solmization, instead of do re mi fa sol la si, were fa sol la fa sol la mL Sh. often shows that he was a musician as well as a lover of music. Wright: For Dr Burney’s note, Mr Chappell assures me, there is not the slightest foundation. Edmund is merely singing to himself in order not to seem to observe Edgar’s approach. [Just as Mistress Quickly sings < And down, down, adown-a ’ in Merry Wives, I, iii, 44, when Doctor Caius is approaching.—Ed.] Moberly: .The true explanation probably is that the sequence * fa sol la mi * (with * mi * descending) is like a deep sigh, as may be easily heard by trial."

        "Theobald/Warburton/Johnson/Capell/Moberly: Old fools ... abused] Theobald (Nichols’s Lit. Hist. II, 371) suggests abuses, but did not repeat the suggestion in his ed. Warburton: Common sense tells us Sh. must have wrote: ‘Old Folks are ... With checks, not flatteries when ... abused’—i.e., old folks being grown children again, they should be used as we use children, with ‘checks’ when we find the little ‘flatteries’ we employ to quiet them are ‘abus’d’ by their becoming more peevish by indulgence. Johnson: Old men must be treated with checks, when as they are seen to be deceived with flatteries; or, when they are once weak enough to be seen abused by flatteries, they are then weak enough to be used with checks. There is a play of the words used and abused. To abuse is, in our author, very frequently the same as to deceive. This construction is harsh and ungrammatical; Sh. perhaps thought it vicious, and chose to throw away the lines rather than correct them, nor would now thank the officiousness of his editors, who restore what they do not understand. Tyrwhitt: Old fools—must be used with checks, as well as flatteries, when they (i.e. flatteries) are seen to be abused. Dyce (Remarks, &c., p. 222): ‘As’ meaning as well as. Halliwell: The rest of the line, after the word ‘checks,’ loses its reference to the child, and merely alludes to the old man as king used to be flattered, which flatteries, being felt by him, are abused. I have very little doubt, however, but that here there is either an omission or a gross corruption. Moberly: ‘When they are seen abused’ = when they are so plainly misguided. If ‘checks as flatteries’ is the right reading, the meaning must be ‘checks as well as flatteries.’ But may not Sh. have written ‘with checks as flat!’—i.e. ‘as decidedly as we restrain children.’ This would easily corrupt into ‘flattery.’"

        "Theobald: defuse] Theobald was the first to restore 'defuse,' but he spelled it diffuse, and it is not clear from his note that he had a correct notion of its meaning. Hanmer adopted Theobald's spelling, and gives the true definition: 'to disguise.' This interpretation and spelling make Capell indignant, and he urges his emendation deface, thus: 'If I can but deface my speech by a strange accent as effectually as I have defac'd my person by a strange attire, then my good intent may do so and so; now for this deface and defad substitute diffuse and diffus'd, and see how you like it; and if diffuse would have suited in this respect, it had not been given to Kent, whose language is more natural.' Steevens: We must suppose that Kent advances looking on his disguise. To diffuse speech signifies to disorder it, and so to disguise it. It may, however, mean to speak broad with a clownish accent. Dyce (Rem. 223) cites 'Dyffuse harde to be vnderstande, diffused—Palsgrave's Lesdar, de la Lang. Fr., 1530. 'But oft by it [logick] a thing playne, bright and pure, Is made diffuse, vnlmowen, harde, and obscure.'—Barclay's Ship of Fooles, ed. 1570. Kent does not wish to render his speech difficult to be understood, but merely to disorder it, to disguise it, as he had disguised his person. Wright cites instances of the use of 'defuse' from Lyly's Euphues (ed. Arber), p. 645 and Armin's Nest of Ninnies, p. 6 (Shaksp. Soc. ed.). For other instances from Sh., see Concordance or Schmidt's Lex."

Hence the proverbial phrase of, 'He's an honest man, and eats no fish,' to signify he's a friend to the government and a Protestant. The eating fish, on a religious account, being then esteemed such a badge of popery, that when it was enjoined for a season by act of parliament, for the encouragement of the fish-towns, it was thought necessary to declare the reason; hence it was called 'Cecil's fast.' To this disgraceful badge of popery Fletcher alludes in his Woman-Hater [IV, ii], who makes the courtezan say, when Lazarillo, in search of the umbrana's head, was seized at her house by the intelligencers for a traitor; 'Gentlemen, I am glad you have discovered him; he should not have eaten under my roof for twenty pounds; and surely I did not like him when he called for fish.' And Marston's Dutch Courtezan [I, ii]: 'I trust I am none of the wicked that eate fish a Fridaies.' [Dyce, in his ed. of the Woman-Hater, cites this note by Warburton, and adds: 'Perhaps Warburton is right.'] Capell thinks that this means simply that Kent was a jolly fellow, and no lover of such meagre diet as fish."

        "Why, Fool] Knight ; The text of the Folio [see Textual Notes] clearly shows that the speech was intended for Lear, and that, however it might have been written originally, Sh. in his amended copy would not permit Kent, in his character of serving-man, so soon to begin bandying questions with Lear’s favorite. White : The Folio is clearly wrong, as the Fool’s reply shows. Lear had taken * no one’s part that’s out of favour,’ but Kent had. The mistake seems to be due to the fact that both Lear and Kent reply interrogatively to the Fool’s remark about his coxcomb. Dyce: The eye of the transcriber or compositor most probably caught the next speech but one. It is plain that the Fool addresses the king for the first time when he says :‘ How now, nuncle,’ &c. Schmidt silently follows F^F^, which are to meunquestionably wrong."

In the same style the fools called each other cousin. In Beaumont and Fletcher’s Pilgrim, when Alinda assumes the character of a fool, she uses the same language. She meets Alphonso, and calls him mmcle; to which he replies by calling her naunt Wrights. So in Promos and Cassandra, iv, 7, we find ‘my nown good harte roote’. In Littre’s Diet, under the word ‘Tante,’ it is stated that ‘nante’ is a form of the word in Picardy, and in justification of the derivation of tante from ta ante, reference is made to the Wallon dialect, in w^hich mononk, matante, and similar forms are used, the possessive pronoun having no force whatever. If the origin of ‘nuncle’ is not analogous, it must be referred to the principle by which Noll, Ned, Nan, Nell, Numps are formed from Oliver, Edward, Anne, Ellen and Humphrey."

In speaking of him, he gives him his official title; but in speaking to him, he always uses some term of familiar and pitiful endearment,—generally, “my boy,”—although the poor fellow had plainly had many years’ sad experience of the world.

There is no trace of such a proverbial saying as ‘like the breath of an unfee’d lawyer,’ while all the world knows the proverb : ‘Whosoever is his own counsel has a fool for his client.’ How unfee’d lawyers may have comported themselves in Shakespeare’s time I know not; but I am bound to say, in vindication of ‘my order,’ that in my time there has been no ground for the Fool’s sarcasm upon the bar. The two occasions when ‘the breath of an unfee’d lawyer’ attracts notice in this generation, are when he pleads for a party suing in forma pauperis, or when he defends a person prosecuted by the Crown for high treason. It is contrary to etiquette to take a fee in the one case as in the other; and on all such occasions counsel, from a regard to their own credit, as well as from conscientious motives, uniformly exert themselves with extraordinary zeal, and put forth all their learning and eloquence. 135-150: Johnson: [Those lines (135-150)] were omitted in the Ff, perhaps for political reasons, as they seemed to censure the monopolies."

Staunton: The very remarkable effect of this band, in the contraction of the brows, may be observed in some of the monumental effigies of the fourteenth century, and especially in those small figures usually called ‘Weepers’ which are found standing in tabernacles, on the sides of rich altar-tombs of the same period. Lear, however, may be supposed to speak metaphorically. Wright: Compare I Hen, IV: I, iii, 19: 'And majesty might never yet endure The moody frontier of a servant brow,' where ‘frontier’ is apparently used with some reference to tire or head-dress."

        "Fool: Jug] Moberly: Whoop...thee] He seems to mean, ‘As things have got the wrong way forward, I know what fair lady I must pay my court to now.’ ‘Jug’ is a vulgar form of ‘Jane,’ and he expresses the idea present to his mind in the first grotesquely similar form which his memory suggests.",
        "Fool: Jug] Ed. (citing Heywood and Jordan): Whoop...thee] At the end of the edition of Heywood’s Rape of Lucrece, printed in 1638, a song is given which begins: ‘Arise, arise, my Juggie, my Puggie,’ and Juggie replies in the next verse, ‘Begon, begon, my Willie, my Billie.’ In a note on the present passage, in his translation of Lear, JORDAN says that ‘Whoop’ may mean either a shout or a bird, the hoopoo; and that ‘Jug’ may mean, first, the nickname for Joan; secondly, a pool or puddle [where did he find this meaning?]; and thirdly, it may be an imperative of a verb to jug, which he informs us means to entice like a bird, especially to imitate the note of a nightingale. These three meanings yield three interpretations: first, the usual one, as the refrain of a ballad; second, as the answer to the foregoing question ‘May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse?’ and to be paraphrased: ‘Gee-up, puddle! I love thee!’ and supposed to be addressed by the cart to the mud-hole into which it rolls back, thus drawing the horse after it; and lastly, we have the interpretation adopted by the translator himself, with this explanation: Goneril having shown in her first speech to her father how fond her thoughts are, changes her tone when she next speaks to him, and cloaks her reproaches under the garb of filial love; but the Fool detects her, and, designating her as a hoopoo, which is supposed to be a filthy bird, says to her: Sing, hoopoo, like a nightingale, the words ‘I love thee,’ or, as in the translation: ‘Sing, Dreckhahn, wie ’ne Nachtigall: Ich liebe dich.’ 219-228: KING LEAR: father] Roderick: Does...father] Whether it be due to the incoherence of Lear’s passion or to the sophistications of the compositor, these lines have given rise to much discussion among the early commentators. The later editors have been concerned chiefly with the metrical arrangement, and have little or nothing to say about the meaning of the passage. Roderick (Can. of Crit., p. 267, 1763) holds Lear’s first speech (lines 219–223) to be ironical. Goneril has told him that he is transported beyond himself, and he ironically assents to it. To support this view, Roderick changes ‘Ha! waking?’ into waking;’ that is, ‘This is not Lear, whether in lethargy or waking—it is not Lear.’ He would also change ‘Who is it that can tell me?’ into ‘Who is it then can tell me?’ Here the irony ceases and serious resentment begins. ‘If I were to be persuaded by the marks of (i.e. the distinction and respect due to) my sovereignty (as king), my knowledge (as an old man, of long experience) or my reason (as a man, one of the superior sex) that I had daughters, it would appear that I was falsely so persuaded. You are therefore a stranger, and I demand your name.’ This interpretation of Roderick’s needs no refutation. Heath denounces it as unnatural to a person in Lear’s situation, just then transported to the highest pitch of astonishment, and not yet sufficiently familiarised to his misfortunes, nor cool enough, to treat the author of them ironically. Heath himself interprets lines 221, 222: ‘Either his apprehension is decayed, his faculty of discernment is buried under a lethargic sleep, or—here he was about to go on to the other alternative—viz; he is in his sober senses and broad awake, when the sudden whirl of passion on the bare imagination that what had passed is real, so overwhelms him that he breaks off: Ha! what! that it should be possible that I am now awake? It cannot be, ’tis impossible.’ Warburton aroused the critics by his dogmatic assertion that we should read sovereignty knowledge—the understanding, like ‘sovereignty of reason’ in Ham., because his sovereignty or kingship would not enable Lear to judge whether or not these were his daughters. Heath as usual flouts and routs Warburton, but without giving a much better interpretation of the phrase. He defines ‘sovereignty’ as that self-command which distinguishes the man in his senses from a lunatic or idiot: ‘If I should give credit to those marks I perceive in myself of being in my right senses, and endued with knowledge and reason, I should be persuaded I had daughters,’ &c. Tyrwhitt says that the difficulty is ‘to conceive how “the marks of sovereignty, of knowledge, and of reason” should be of any use to persuade Lear that he had or had not daughters. No logic could draw such a conclusion from such premises. This difficulty may be entirely removed by only pointing the passage thus: “for by the marks of sovereignty, knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded.—I had daughters.—Your name, fair gentlewoman?” The chain of Lear’s speech being thus untangled, we can clearly trace the succession and connection of his ideas. The undutiful behaviour of his daughter so disconcerts him that he doubts by turns whether she is Goneril and whether he himself is Lear. Upon her first speech, he only exclaims, “Are you our daughter?” Upon her going on in the same style, he begins to question his own sanity, and even his personal identity. He appeals to the bystanders, “Who is it that can tell me who I am?” I should be glad to be told. For (if I was to judge myself) by the marks of sovereignty, of knowledge, and of reason (which once distinguished Lear, but which I have now lost), / should be false (against my own consciousness) persuaded (that I am not Lear). He then slides to the examination of another distinguishing mark of Lear: “I had daughters.” But not able, as it should seem, to dwell upon so tender a subject, he hastily recurs to his first doubt concerning Goneril: “Your name, fair gentlewoman?” Of this note by Tyrwhitt, Johnson says that it is ‘written with confidence disproportionate to the conviction which it can bring. Lear might as well know by the marks and tokens arising from sovereignty, knowledge, and reason, that he had or had not daughters, as he could know by anything else. But, says he, if I judge by these tokens, I find the persuasion false by which I long thought myself the father of daughters,’ Mason says that by the marks of sovereignty Lear means those tokens of royalty which his daughters then enjoyed as derived from him. But Malone replies: ‘Lear had not parted with all the marks of sovereignty. In the midst of his prodigality to his children, he reserved to himself the name and all the additions to a king.’ Staunton says that this passage is ‘certainly obscure. Possibly the meaning may be restored by simply omitting the comma after “sovereignty,” “—by the marks of sovereignty knowledge and reason”—i.e. of supreme or sovereign knowledge, &c.’ Knight puts dashes, to indicate continued speech, after Lear’s question, ‘Who is it that can tell me who I am?—’; after the Fool’s answer, ‘Lear’s shadow.—’; and after ‘I should be false persuaded I had daughters—’ and defends his punctuation on the ground that the Fool interrupts Lear with the answer, ‘Lear’s shadow,’ and that Lear continues to speak without reference to the Fool’s interposition, and that the Fool in the same way continues the thread of his comment: ‘Which they will make an obedient father.’ Here ‘which’ refers to ‘shadow.’ In this interpretation Knight follows Douce (ii, 147). A passage of such defective metre as this could not escape Walker; accordingly [Crit. i, 4] he gives, line 221, ‘Either his motion [sic. Probably a misprint.] weakens, or ’s discernings and, following the Qq in lines 222–227, arranges, and changes: ‘—Sleeping or waking?—Ha! || Sure ’tis not so. || Who is’t [omitting that] can tell me who I am?—Lear’s shadow?—|| I would learn that; for by the marks of sov’reignty, || Knowledge and reason, I should be false persuaded || [That] I had daughters.’ Lettsom, Walker’s admirable editor, referring to Walker’s adoption of the text of the Qq, says; ‘It appears to me that just here the Qq give an unsophisticated text, though one disfigured by some palpable blunders, while in the Folio we have a text derived from a good original, but sophisticated in a blundering way for the sake of the metre.’ Schmidt: Perhaps there is here a real gap in the Ff, but the lines which the Qq offer in its place are too questionable to be adopted in the text."

The originals whom he copied were no doubt men of quick parts; lively and sarcastic. Though they were licensed to say anything, it was still necessary, to prevent giving offence, that everything they said should have a playful air; we may suppose, therefore, that they had a custom of taking off the edge of too sharp a speech by covering it hastily with the end of an old song, or any glib nonsense that came into the mind. I know no other way of accounting for the incoherent words with which Sh. often finishes this Fool’s speeches, Knight [after quoting this note by Sir Joshua Reynolds, continues]: But the words before us are not incoherent words. The expression ‘so out went the candle,’ may have been proverbial to signify the desertion of a man by his mercenary friends when he is become a ‘sheal’d peascod.’ But Sh. found the almost identical image applied to the story of Lear as related by Spenser: ‘But true it is, that, when the oil is spent, The light goes out and wick is thrown away; So when he had resign’d his egiment. His daughter ’gan despise his drooping day.’"

        "GONERIL: depend] Warburton interprets ‘continue in service;’ or, as Wright says, ‘that shall still remain dependents,’ but Schmidt denies this meaning, and maintains with Delius that the phrase signifies: ‘this shall still be one of the conditions, that they are men as may besort your age,’ &c. ‘Even if dependant means a retainer, a servant, the verb depend, used absolutely, never means to serve, to be in a person's service, but it indicates the opposite of personal freedom, the position of a subject and bondman. “A life so stinkingly depending,” in Meas. for Meas., III, ii, 28, means, a life which is the slave of disgusting coarseness. The remark “you depend upon Lord Paris,” in Tro. and Cres., which, of course, means you are one of the servants of Lord Paris,—a simple menial perverts by the reply, “I depend upon the lord.” If “that,” in the present passage, be a relative, the phrase can only mean: that shall continue to remain servants, not their own masters.’ [Which is exactly what Wright says it means; and is not only the simpler explanation of the two, but wholly avoids any grammatical difficulty. According to Schmidt’s interpretation the sentence is an anacoluthon,—there is no verb for ‘remainder,’ and he has to suggest that, grammatically, ‘To be such men,’ should be ‘On their being such men.’ Ed.]"

Wright: Sandys (Travels, p. 105, ed. 1637) gives a picture said to be portrayed in the porch of the temple of Minerva at Sais, in which is the figure of a river-horse, denoting ‘murder, impudence, violence, and injustice; for they say that he killeth his Sire, and ravisheth his owne dam.’ His account is evidently taken from Plutarch’s Isis and Osiris, and Sh. may have read it in Holland’s translation, p. 1300; but why he should call the river-horse a ‘sea-monster’ is not clear. It is more likely that by the sea- monster he meant the whale. See IV, ii, 49, 50; Mis Well, IV, iii, 249; Tro. and Cres. V, v, 23."

        "KING LEAR: curse] Davies: curse] I have heard certain critics complain that, in pronouncing this denunciation, Garrick was too deliberate, and not so quick in the emission of his words as he ought to have been; that he did not yield to that impetuosity which the situation required. ... Garrick rendered the curse so terribly affecting to the audience, that, during his utterance of it, they seemed to shrink from it as from a blast of lightning. His preparation for it was extremely affecting; his throwing away his crutch, kneeling on one knee, clasping his hands together, and lifting his eyes toward heaven, presented a picture worthy the pencil of Raphael. ... Dr Franklin [the translator of Sophocles] thinks nothing can exceed the bitterness of CEdipus’s execration of his two sons, except perhaps this curse of Lear.",
        "KING LEAR: curse] Boaden: curse] In January [1788] Kemble acted Lear [in Tate’s version, to the Cordelia of Mrs. Siddons] ... The curse, as he then uttered it, harrowed up the soul; the gathering himself together, with hands convulsively clasped, the increasing fervour and rapidity, and the suffocation of the concluding words, all evinced consummate skill and original invention. The countenance, too, was finely made up, and in grandeur approached the most awful impersonation of Michael Angelo.",
        "KING LEAR: curse] Scott: curse] There was visible in Kemble’s manner, at times, a sacrifice of energy of action to grace. We remember this observation being made by Mrs Siddons herself, who admired her brother in general as much as she loved him. Nor shall we easily forget the mode in which she illustrated her meaning. She arose and placed herself in the attitude of one of the old Egyptian statues; the knees joined together, and the feet turned a little inwards. She placed her elbows close to her sides, folded her hands, and held them upright, with the palms pressed to each other. Having made us observe that she had assumed one of the most constrained, and, therefore, most ungraceful positions possible, she proceeded to recite the curse of King Lear on his undutiful offspring in a manner which made hair rise and flesh creep, and then called on us to remark the additional effect which was gained by the concentrated energy which the unusual and ungraceful position in itself implied.",
        "KING LEAR: curse] Gould: curse] It is customary to call this imprecation on Goneril ‘the curse.’ This word roughens the sense of it unnecessarily. It is in substance a pagan prayer that she may be childless; but ‘if she must teem,’ that her child may be a ‘thwart disnatured torment to her;’ that she may suffer the same kind and quality of anguish which she is now inflicting on her father. The principle of the prayer is ‘an eye for an eye.’ Putting ‘Jehovah’ instead of ‘Nature, a Jew might have uttered it. Booth began it as a solemn adjuration to the unseen power of Nature. The indignant bitterness in the terms of imprecation seemed as if it was converted out of sweetest images of what a child should be, that lay in the core of his fatherly heart. This double action of his mind, in the agony which it involved, swayed and shook the kneeling figure, and lent his voice a wild vibration that drew involuntary sympathy and awe. The heart followed him as he arose and ran out with extended arms. ... [When he re-enters, on the word ‘resume,’ line 303] he cast the whole energy of his royal will, with a volumed, prolonged, and ringing intonation. His very figure seemed to dilate with majesty."

        "1 : Jennens : Go you] Jennens holds that this is addressed to the Gentleman whose entrance with Lear is marked in the Ff. It is plain,’ he argues, ‘that the letter to Regan was sent by Kent; those to Glo’ster by another; the order to Kent was left out,’—his text accordingly reads: ‘Lear, [to a Gentleman] Go you before to Glo’ster with these letters.—You with this to my daughter Regan, [to Kent] Acquaint,’ &c.\n1 : Capell : Gloucester] Capell, followed by the subsequent editors, has removed this difficulty, expressed by Jennens in the preceding note, by supposing that this name refers to the city of Gloucester, as is evident from the “there” [in line 4]; it is made the residence of Regan and Cornwall to give ‘likelihood’ to their evening visit to Gloucester, II, iv, whose castle is in the neighborhood; ‘earls, in old time, had some dominion in the counties that gave them their titles, and resided there usually.’\n7 : Walker : brains] Walker (Crit., i, 256): Braiùn surely.\n7 : Wright : brains] Wright: Sh. uses both ‘brains’ and ‘brain’ indiscriminately, except in such phrases as ‘to beat out the brains.’ Here it is a singular, of which there is another, though doubtful, instance in Ham. III, i, 174, and a more certain one in All’s Well III, ii, 16; “The brains of my Cupid’s knocked out.”\n7 : Morerly : brains] Morerly: The fool laughs at Kent’s promise of rapidity, and says, first, ‘that when men’s brains are in their heels’ (that is, when they have no more wit than is needed to go fast) ‘they may get brain-chilblains;’ and secondly, ‘that as Lear has no brains, he is in no such danger.’\n10 : Eccles : slip-shod] Eccles: The customary resource of those who are afflicted with kibes. Singer paraphrases: For you show you have no wit in undertaking your present journey.\n13 : Mason : kindly] Mason; Here it means both, affectionately and like the rest of her kind.\n14 : Wright : crab] Wright: Compare Lyly, Euphues, p. 120 (ed. Arber): ‘The sower Crabbe hath the shew of an Apple as well as the sweet Pippin.’\n15 : Collier : can] Collier suggests that con of the Qq (i. e. know) may be the right reading.\n19 : [Annotator] : on’s] See I, iv, 98.\n21 : Abbott : of] Abbott, § 175: signifying proximity of any kind, is sometimes used locally in the sense of on.\n23 : Weiss : I did her wrong] Weiss (p. 281): The beautiful soul of Cordelia, that is little talked of by herself, and is but stingily set forth by circumstance, engrosses our feeling in scenes from whose threshold her filial piety is banished. We know what Lear is so pathetically remembering; the sisters tell us in their cruellest moments; it mingles with the midnight storm a sigh of the daughterhood that was repulsed. In the pining of the Fool we detect it. Through every wail or gust of this awful symphony of madness, ingratitude, and irony, we feel a woman’s breath,\n31 : Abbott : Be] Abbott, § 299: As a rule, it will be found that ‘be’ is used with some notion of doubt, question, thought, &c.; for instance, in questions [as here], and after verbs of thinking.\n34 : Delius and Wright : seven stars] Both Delius and Wright refer this phrase to the Pleiades, a constellation which assuredly is known by the name of The Seven Stars; may it not, however, refer to the Great Bear, whose seven stars are the most conspicuous group in the circle of perpetual apparition in the Northern Hemisphere?—so conspicuous, indeed, that the Latin word for ‘North’ was derived from them. We call this constellation ‘The Dipper,’ from its fancied resemblance to the utensil of that name; a name, I believe, scarcely known in England.—Ed.\n37 : Johnson : perforce] Johnson: He is meditating on his resumption of royalty.\n37 : Steevens : perforce] Steevens: Rather he is meditating on his daughter’s having in so violent a manner deprived him of those privileges which before she had agreed to grant him. Delius thinks that Johnson’s interpretation is the more plausible, although ‘Monster ingratitude’ is more in the train of thought suggested by Steevens. Wright also agrees with Johnson’s interpretation, as more in keeping with what Lear says in line 31: ‘I will forget my nature.’\n43 : Coleridge : Oh, let me not be mad] Coleridge: The deepest tragic notes are often struck by a half sense of an impending blow.\n43 : Bucknill : mad] Bucknill (p. 183): This self-consciousness of gathering madness is common in various forms of the disease. ... A most remarkable instance of this was presented in the case of a patient, whose passionate, but generous, temper became morbidly exaggerated after a blow upon the head. His constantly expressed fear was that of impending madness; and when the calamity he so much dreaded had actually arrived, and he raved incessantly and incoherently, one frequently heard the very words of Lear proceeding from his lips: ‘Oh, let me not be mad!’\n48-49 : Eccles : departure...shorter] Eccles: This concluding rhyme seems to intimate that the Fool expects to return soon, because of the ill treatment which he will probably receive where he is going.\n48-49 : Steevens : departure...shorter] Steevens: This idle couplet is apparently addressed to the females present at the performance of the play; and, not improbably, crept into the playhouse copy from the mouth of some buffoon actor, who ‘spoke more than was set down for him.’ It should seem, from Shakespeare’s speaking in this strong manner, that he suffered the injury he describes. Indecent jokes, which the applause of the groundlings might occasion to be repeated, would at last find their way into the prompters’ books, &c. I am aware that such liberties were exercised by the authors of Locrine, &c., but can such another offensive and extraneous address to the audience be pointed out among all the dramas of Shakespeare?\n48-49 : Coleridge : departure...shorter] Coleridge: The Fool’s conclusion of this Act, by a grotesque prattling, seems to indicate the dislocation of feeling that has begun and is to be continued.\n48-49 : C. A. Brown : departure...shorter] C. A. Brown (p. 292): There are three passages, foisted in by the players, and adopted by the printers, which ought to be for ever expunged from the text: The couplet at the end of Act I; the whole of Merlin’s prophecy, III, ii, 79–95, as the Fool should go out with Lear, and those brutal words: ‘And I’ll go to bed at noon,’ III, vi, 83, when the old king sinks into sleep. Such contradictions puzzled me for a long time, till looking among the Annotations, a profitable task once in a hundred times, I discovered that none of these three passages are in the Qq, printed eight years before Shakespeare’s death, but are introduced into the Ff, printed seven years after it. This, together with their absurdity, makes it plain that they are not Shakespeare’s. [The present passage is not omitted in the Qq.]\n48-49 : Singer : departure...shorter] Singer: She who thinks that this journey we are now starting on will better us, and bring us mirth, is such a simpleton that, if she is a maid now, she will be cheated before long of her claim to that title.\n48-49 : White : departure...shorter] White: Steevens’s opinion that this is an interpolation appears to be well founded. The indecency is entirely gratuitous; it is ‘dragged in by the head and shoulders,’ which is not in Shakespeare’s manner. The jest, if we must call it such, is of the most miserable sort, and one which Sh. would hardly suffer in the mouth of this, the most thoughtful and subtly whimsical of all his thoughtful and subtle Fools. [See also note on the Merlin prophecy, III, ii, 81.]\n48-49 : Ellis : departure] Ellis (p. 200) refers to lists of words given by Cooper, 1685, showing that Cooper pronounced the final -ture in lecture, nature, picture, scripture, &c. as -ter; the present rhyme shows that ‘departure’ was so pronounced in Shakespeare’s day. White (vol. xii, p. 437) says that -ure final was generally, if not universally, pronounced -er among even the most polite and literate of our Elizabethan ancestors. Ellis, after quoting this observation by White, says (p. 973), that this usage was not general or confirmed till the XVIIth century. [For the rhyme, see also II, iii, 20.]"

        "Upon his party] Delius was the first to interpret rightly these two questions of Edmund’s. In order to confuse his brother and urge him to a more speedy flight, by giving him the idea that he is surrounded by perils, Edmund asks Edgar first, whether he has not spoken ’gainst the Duke of Cornwall, and then, reversing the question, asks whether he has not said something on the side of Cornwall ’gainst the Duke of Albany, Schmidt gives seven instances, besides the present, where ‘upon the party’ means ‘upon the side of.’ Before Delius, Hanmer’s interpretation obtained, by which line 26 was regarded as only another way of putting the same question as that in line 23; thus: Have you said nothing upon the party formed by him against the Duke of Albany? Capell added that we must supply the word ‘reflecting’ before ‘upon.’ The passage so puzzled Johnson that he believed it to be corrupt, and proposed the reading : Against his party, for the Duke of Albany? Eccles noted how Edmund grasped at every motive, however trivial or insignificant, that would enforce Edgar’s departure. Moberly gives an ingenious interpretation of this second question of Edmund’s : the war being only ‘toward,’ and having not yet broken out, ‘Albany would be in a position to demand the punishment of any one who spoke against him, and Cornwall not unlikely to concede it, as Elizabeth might have done, if his warlike preparations were not sufficiently advanced to make it safe to throw down the gauntlet.’"

Dreadfull, frightful!, fearefull; horrible, gastfull, horride.’ The form 'gaster’ is found in Harsnet’s Declaration of Popish Imposture (1603), p- 73 : ‘ Did euer the Godgastring Giants, whom lupiter overwhelmed with Pelion and Ossa, so complaine of theyr loade ?’ Mr Skeat has pointed out to me an excellent example of ' gast ’ in The Vision of Piers Plowman, Text A, Passus vii, 1 , 129: *Bo]?e to sowen and to setten • and saued his tilje, Gaste Crowen from his Corn • and kepen his Beestes.’"

        "death] Moberly: This skilful suggestion, that Edmund should be put into Edgar’s place, is acted upon at once by Gloucester; yet it is so indirect that Gloucester imagines the thought to have come from himself. Lord Bacon, in his essay on Cunning, speaks of the trick of ^ turning cat in pan that is, making a suggestion in such a way that the hearer supposes it to be his own. This may be done either coarsely—' as you said, and wisely was it said,’ was Polonius’s way of impressing his own thoughts on the king—or, in a more skilful way, as here.’",
        "pregnant] In 3Peas, for Meas, I, i, 12, Johnson first defined this w^ord by • ready,’ and this definition has been adopted as its general meaning in Sh. down to the present day; certainly it is generally thus interpreted in, the present passage. Wright goes so far as to say that it ^is used by Sh., without any reference to its literal meaning, in the sense of “ready;”’ he afterwards defines it as \"manifest, obvious,’ in certain passages which he cites. Schmidt gives no intimation that it is used in its ‘literal meaning;’ the fourteen instances of its use that he cites he divides under three heads : ist, expert, clever, ingenious, artful ; 2d, disposed, ready, prompt (under this head the present passage is cited) ; 3d, probable in the highest degree, clear, evident. Now, on the other hand, I cannot but tbink that Nares came nearer the truth when he said that the ruling sense of this word is that of ‘being full or productive of something.’ Out of Schmidt’s fourteen instances eleven appear to me to come under Nares’s definition. Three instances {Lear IV, vi, 222; Wint. Tale, V, xi, 34; and Ajzt. and Chop. II, i, 45) are used in so metaphorical a sense that one may give to them almost any meaning that his mother wit suggests as applicable to the passage. My interpretation of the ‘pregnant hinges of the knee’ in Earn, III, ii, 56, is there recorded; the present passage seems to me exactly parallel, and may be paraphrased thus : ‘So great are the profits of my death that the spurs to make thee seek it are most powerful, and teem with incitements thereto.’ Schmidt in his edition repeats his definitions of ‘pregnant,’ and doubts if, thus defined, Sh. ever could have applied it to ‘spurs,’ and, while faithful to the Folio, confesses that spirits form but a poor predicate to ‘ profits,’ yet in the sense of evil spirits that it is at least as probable a reading as ‘spurs.’ In my opinion the reading of the Folio is a mis- print for ‘spurs’ of the Quarto. * Pregnant ’ is quite as appropriate to ' spurs ’ as to ^ hinges.'— E d,"

        "This line Abbott, § 478, scans in two ways ; First, by pronouncing the last syllable in it ‘ with a kind of “ burr,” which produced the effect of an additional syllable;’ and as he cites ‘sirrah’ as an instance of this ‘burr,’ the best way, probably, of conveying his idea in spelling would be ‘ Ed-garrah.’ Or, secondly, Abbott queries whether it might not be scanned, by pronouncing ‘ your ’ dissoluii, thus : ‘najmed? you|r Edgar?’ Of these two methods, the latter seems preferable. Walker {Crit. ii, 145) suggests, in his chapter on the omission of repeated words, that Gloucester says ; * 0 1 O lady,’ and that the first ‘ O I ’ which closed this line had been omitted, Lettsom, in a foot-note, queries ‘ “ your Edgar, Gloster Gloster may have been left out at the end of the line in consequence of Glo, occurring at the beginning of the next.’ For Collier’s (MS) emendation, see Textual Notes; Moberly, 1‘eferring to this emendation, says : ‘ Probably the intense tone of astonishment would give a prolonging accentuation to several of the syllables as the line stands, and make it in reality long enough without the addition. If the reading, however, was invented, its inventor had a good notion of the way in which consonants fall out of the body of a word. There would be the same kind of identity between ‘heir’ and ‘Edgar’ as between ‘Audrey’ and ‘Ethelreda,’ ‘Maude’ and ‘Matilda; ’ and his theory would be that, from the similarity of the two words, one liad got dropped,’"

Steevens surmised that it might import the same as Lob's Pound; with which it seems to have no more connection than that ‘pinfold’ means ‘Pound’ and ‘Lob’ and ‘Lipsbury’ begin with the same letter. ‘Lob’s Pound,’ as is well known, means a place of confinement, whether a prison or the stocks. N^ares’s guess is perhaps as happy as any: ‘It may be,’ he says, ‘a coined name, and it is just possible that it might mean the teeth, as being the pinfold within the lips,’ Collier’s MS gives Finsbury, where, says that editor, there must have been a pinfold, well known to Shakespeare’s audiences; and this word, through mishearing or misprinting, was corrupted to ‘Lipsbury.’ Halliwell simply cites Nares; and Dyce says merely: ‘A pinfold is a pound; but what the commentators have written about the name Lipsbury is too unsatisfactory to be cited.’ Wright thinks Nares’s explanation the most probable which has yet been given, and adds: Similar names of places, which may or may not have any local existence, occur in proverbial phrases, such, for instance, as ‘Needham’s Shore,’ ‘Weeping Cross.’"

        "Steevens: three-suited] This might mean, one who had no greater change of raiment than three suits would furnish him with. So in Jonson’s Silent Woman [IV, ii, p. 447, ed. Gifford]: ‘thou wert a pitiful poor fellow, …, and hadst nothing but three suits of apparel;’ or it may signify a fellow thrice-sued at law, who has three suits for debt standing out against him.",
        "Delius: three-suited] This cannot refer to his poverty, but, rather, like ‘glass-gazing,’ signifies foppishness, changing his suits that many times, or else wearing them all at the same time. When Edgar describes his former wealthy state, he says of himself [III, iv, 129], ‘who hath had three suits to his back.’ Wright: If the terms of agreement between master and servant in Shakespeare’s time were known, they would probably throw light upon the phrase. It is probable that three suits of clothes a year were part of a servant’s allowance. In Jonson’s Silent Woman, III, i, Mrs Otter, scolding her husband, whom she treats as a dependant, says, ‘Who gives you your maintenance, I pray you? Who allows you your horse- meat and man’s-meat, your three suits of apparel a year? your four pair of stockings, one silk, three worsted?’ [According to the Cambridge Editors, ‘Qq, Bodl. I,’ has the misprint snyted, which is corrected in the other Qq to shewted. From this circumstance, Wright inferred not only that the enumeration of the Qq in the Cam. ed. was wrong, and that what he and his fellow-editor had there called Q1 was in reality the earliest impression of all, but that ‘suit’ in Shakespeare’s day was pronounced shoot. He supposes that while the ‘edition was in course of printing the error, snyted, was discovered, and the correction communicated verbally to the compositor, who inserted it according to his own notions of spelling.’—Ellis’s E. E. Pronunciation, p, 217. This hypothesis (which is certainly as old as Steevens), in regard to the pronunciation of suit, Wright thinks is strengthened by the puns on suitor and shooter in Love’s Lab. Lost, IV, i, 109, &c., and also in Rowley’s Match in the Dark (1633), II, i; but Ellis (p. 217) doubts whether these instances are enough to decide the point with certainty. Hurried corrections, whether of print or manuscript, frequently introduce additional errors, and hence there is no guarantee that the compositor who substituted shewted for snyted did not himself put shewted where he meant to have inserted sewted, ‘which would be a legitimate orthography for suited.’ ‘In the present day we have a joke of an Irish shopman telling his customer to shoot himself, meaning suit himself. The Irish pronunciation, however, only shows an English pronunciation of the XVIIth century. In England at the present day, shoot for suit would be vulgar, but the joke would be readily understood, though few persons use, or have even heard, the pronunciation. Might not this have been the case in Shakespeare’s time? At any rate, there is no authority for supposing that such a pronunciation could have been used seriously by Sh. himself.’ In his essay on English Pronunciation in the Elizabethan Era (Sh. Works, xii, p. 430), White says: ‘S before a vowel had often the sound of sh, as it now has in sugar and sure. Such was its sound in sue, suit, and its Compounds, and I believe in super and its compounds, and in supine and supreme, … S was also sometimes aspirated before o and u, of which, and of the o sound of ew, see phonographic evidence in the pronunciation of sewer, which was pronounced shore in the Elizabethan era, and thence down to the beginning of the present century. … Hence, too, suit was spelled sickels. Both spellings expressed the same sound,’]"

      "notes": [
        "Johnson: neat] Johnson, who defines this by ‘you mere slave, you very slave,’ comes nearer to the true meaning, I think, than Steevens, although the latter has been followed by Dyce, Schmidt, Wright, and Moberly. Steevens thinks that ‘it means no more than you finical rascal, you are an assemblage of foppery and poverty.’ Then, by way of proof, Steevens cites Jonson in The Poetaster [IV, i]: ‘By thy leave, my neat scoundrel.’ But we must remember that this is spoken by Tucca, a blustering captain, whose speech is full of absurd epithets, and that it is addressed to Gallus, who, we know, is not a ‘scoundrel,’ and are not led to suppose that he is ‘neat’ in the sense of finical. On the contrary, it is more likely that Tucca uses ‘neat’ in the sense which Walker (Crit. ii, 352) ascribes to it here, viz; that of pure, unmixed; still used in the phrase neat wine, &c. Singer suggests that it may mean ‘you base cowherd.’ Staunton has the following note: ‘The sting in this epithet has been quite misunderstood by the commentators, who suppose it to mean mere or finical. For the real allusion, see Wint. Tale, I, ii, 123; “We must be neat, not neat, but cleanly, captain. And yet the steer, the heifer, and the calf, Are all calFd neat.” See also Taylor the Water Poet’s Epigram on the Husband of Mrs Parnell: “Neate can he talke, and feede, and neatly tread, Neate are his feete, but most neate is his head.”’ But, as Wright says, this play on the word 'neat’ would have no especial point as addressed to Oswald. Walker’s interpretation is, I think, the true one. Rushton (Sh. Illust. by Old Authors, p. 63): ‘Because Leontes in Wint. Tale uses the word ‘neat’ in a sense implying the uncleanliness which is common to cattle, or those who tend them, therefore I have thought it probable that Kent may mean that Oswald was like a tenant of neat land (terra villanorum); that is, a base, dirty fellow.’",
        "Dyce (Remarks, &c. p. 225): Part of the Ff is undoubtedly a stage-direction. This is clear from its interfering with the dialogue; Edmund asks “What’s the matter?” and Kent immediately replies, “With you [i.e. ‘the matter is with you, I will deal with you’], goodman boy,” &c. That such a stage-direction is common in old plays, hardly perhaps requires to be shown; one instance, however, may be given: “Rick. Art thou content to breath? [Fight part once or twiset”—A Pleasant Commodie, called Looke about you, 1600. SCHMIDT maintains that “With you” in Kent’s reply does not refer to “What’s the matter,” but to Part of the Folio, which is legitimately a portion of the text and no stage-direction. “Part in Sh. means not only to separate, but also to go away, to depart. Edmund means it in the former sense, and Kent understands in the latter, and asks ‘With you?’ That Sh., in spite of a possible misapprehension, uses topart with in the sense of to go away with something, a passage in Com. of Err. Ill, i, 66, proves: “Ang. Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would fain have either, Bal. In debating which was best we shall part with neither,”’ [This is very ingenious, but, I fear, not convincing.—Ed.]"

Malone added ‘attent’ for attentive in “Ham. I, ii, 193,” and proposed to read, metrically, ‘Like rats, oft bite those cords in twain, which are Too,’ etc. ‘The word Intrinsicate,’ he adds, ‘was but newly introduced into our language when this play was written. See Marston’s Scourge of Villanie [vol. iii, p. 245, ed. Halliwell]: “new-minted epithets (as reall, intrinsecate Delphicke).”’ Wright says it is ‘difficult to say how intrinsecate is formed.

If two be suspended in the same roome, they will not regularly conform their breasts; but oft- times respect the opposite points of heaven.’] Byce (Glosl.) cites from Charlotte Smith’s Natural Hist. of Birds, p. 88, in proof that the belief in a connection between the Halcyon and the wind still lingered in the cottages of England in 1807."

Steevens: Camelot] Thus in Drayton’s Polyolbion, The Third Song [p. 252, ed. 1748]: ‘Like Camelot, what place was ever yet renown’d? Where, as at Caerleon oft, he kept the table round?’ [Besides these two places mentioned in this extract from Drayton, Camelot and Caerleon, there was a third place, Winchester, ‘where,’ as Selden says in his Illustrations to Drayton’s Fourth Song, p. 259, ‘Arthur’s table is yet suppos’d to be, but that seems of later date.’ Capell apparently confounded these three, and maintained that Camelot was Winchester, and thence he inferred that the allusion in the text is to a ‘Winchester goose,’ a cant name for a disgraceful ailment, mentioned in 1 Hen. VI I, iii, 53; Tro. & Cres. V, x, 55. According to Selden, in another note on p. 254: ‘By South-cadbury is that Camelot; a hill of a mile compass at the top, four trenches circling it,’ &c. … Antique report makes this one of Arthur’s places of his Round Table.’ Staunton explains the confusion concerning the different localities of Arthur’s Round Table by showing that ‘The History of King Arthur was so long in the completion that, while in one chapter (xxvi) Camelot is located in the west of England (Somersetshire), in another (xliv) it is stated that “—Camelot is, in English, Winchester.” At a still later period, when Caxton finished the printing of the Mort d’Arthur in 1485, he says of the hero: \"And yet of record remain, in witness of him in Wales, in the town of Camelot, the great Stones,”’ &c. Staunton thinks it unnecessary to imagine with Warburton that there is any allusion to a proverbial saying in the old romances, but concludes with the following explanation of the present passage: ‘In chapter xlix of Arthur’s History the Quest of the White Hart is undertaken by three knights, at the wedding-feast of the king with the princess Guenever, which was held at Camelot. This adventure was encountered by Sir Gawayne, Sir Tor, and King Pellinore, and, whenever they had overcome the knights whom they engaged, the vanquished combatants were always sent \"unto King Arthur, and yielded them unto his grace.”’ Dyce (Glosl.) thinks that there is here perhaps a double allusion, to the geese of Somersetshire, and to vanquished knights; thus both Hanmer and Staunton are right. Halliwell does not believe that there is in the text ‘the slightest allusion to the birds called geese, excepting of course a metaphorical one.’ It is doubtful whether a knowledge of the exact location of Camelot, upon which Staunton and others lay stress, would throw much light on this obscure passage.—Ed.]"

        "Johnson: common saw, &c.] It was perhaps used of men dismissed from an hospital, or house of charity, such as was erected formerly in many places for travellers. Those houses had names properly enough alluded to by heaven's benediction. Capell: This saw occurs in one capital passage of Holinshed, and is there applied to such persons as, going about to make matters better, make them worse, and that is Kent’s application of it:—Lear, says that speaker, who thinks to mend his condition by leaving his eldest daughter and coming to Regan, will find himself in that person’s error who foregoes the benediction of heaven for the common and weak blessing of the warm sun; such opinion had he now entertained of Regan’s superiority in badness. [This ‘capital passage’ from Holinshed Capell gives in his Notes, vol. iii, p. 40: ‘This Augustine after his arrivall converted the Saxons indeede from Paganisme, but as the Proverb sayth, bringing them out of Goddes blessing into the warme sunne, he also imbued them wyth no lesse hurtfull supersticion then they did knowe before.’] Tyrwhitt: This ‘saw’ is in Heywood’s Dialogues on Proverb, Book ii, chap, v: ‘In your rennying from hym to me, ye runne Out of gods blessing into the warme sunne.’ [This quotation from Heywood is given by Capell also (Notes, vol. iii, p. 493), whose text I have followed.—Ed.] Malone: See also Howell’s Collection of English Proverbs, in his Dictionary, 1660; ‘He goes out of God’s blessing to the warm sun, viz. from good to worse.’ Wright: Compare also Lyly’s Eupkues and his England (ed. Arber, p. 320): ‘Thou forsakest Gods blessing to sit in a warm Sunne.’ The proverb is reversed in the Letters of Euphues (ibid. p. 196): ‘Therefore if thou wilt follow my aduice, and prosecute thine owne determination, thou shalt come out of a warme Sunne into Gods blessing.’ Both Walker (Crit. iii, 277) and Dyce (Gloss.) note the use of the proverb as late as Swift. [See Ham. I, ii, 67, where some notes in reference to this ‘saw’ will be found. I think Hunter’s zeal carries him too far when he proposes the same origin to this proverb and to Beatrice’s ‘sunburnt’ in Much Ado, II, i,"

        "Hudson: Nothing...miracles] I am very much in the dark as to what the text means. Of course the literal sense is, ‘hardly anything but misery sees miracles;’ but the question is, what are the particulars referred to, or what are the miraculous things to be seen in this case? and why is misery said to see them? I suspect that ‘see’ is used in the sense of experience; a sense it often bears. In that case the meaning may be, ‘miracles are hardly ever wrought but in behalf of the wretched.’ And upon this thought Kent seems to be building a hope of better times, both for himself and the old king; while, on the other hand, nothing short of a miraculous providence seems able to turn their course of misfortune.",

        "Capell: Cordelia...remedies] Kent expatiates upon his letter; tells you he knows it is from Cordelia by some circumstances of its delivery; and its coming from her is to him a plain proof that she has (as he words it) been fortunately informed of his obscured course: And here a shorter pause follows; and after it, a sentence not perfected, of which ‘who’ is the substantive, and to raise us (viz. the king and himself) words wanting to its completion: words that may be collected, and put in after ‘time,’ though dropped by one in search of conciseness, and buried in ruminating.",
        "Steevens: Cordelia...remedies] I confess I do not understand this passage, unless it may be considered as divided parts of Cordelia’s letter, which he is reading to himself by moonlight; it certainly conveys the sense of what she would have said. In reading a letter, it is natural enough to dwell on those circumstances in it that promise the change in our affairs which we most wish for; and Kent, having read Cordelia’s assurances that she will find a time to free the injured from the enormous misrule of Regan, is willing to go to sleep with that pleasing reflection uppermost in his mind. But this is mere conjecture.",
        "Malone: Cordelia...remedies] Malone does not think that any part of Cordelia’s letter is, or can be, read by Kent. ‘He wishes,’ so Malone continues, ‘for the rising of the sun that he may read it.’ I suspect that two half lines have been lost between the words ‘state’ and ‘seeking.’ This ‘enormous state’ means, I think, the confusion subsisting in the state in consequence of the discord which had arisen between the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall; of which Kent hopes Cordelia will avail herself.",

When Kent says only misery sees miracles, he means that he, disguised as a common man, has already witnessed the wickedness of Goneril, the unhappy condition of the king, he himself, a nobleman, has been stocked like a low, common rogue, and yet it is possible for him to exchange letters with Cordelia. At the word ‘remedies,’ sleep overpowers him, and the sentence is not completed.",
        "Collier: Cordelia...remedies] We are to recollect that Kent, having a letter from Cordelia in his hand, is endeavoring to make out its contents by the imperfect light; he is unable to see distinctly, and hence, perhaps, part of the obscurity of the passage. He can only make out some words, and those not decisively, but sufficiently to enable the audience to judge of the general tenor of what he is trying to read.",

That \"poor Tom\" was their universal name is shown in the first paragraph of Awdeley’s Fraternitye of Vagabondes, 1565: \"An Abraham man is he that walketh bare armed, and bare legged, and fayneth hym selfe mad, and caryeth a packe of wool, or a stycke with baken on it, or such lyke toy, and nameth himselfe poore Tom.\"—ed. Early Eng. Text Soc. p. 3. The great authority in regard to ‘Vagabones’ is Harman’s Caveat or Warening for Common Cursetors, ed. ii, 1567, also reprinted by the E. E. Text Soc. Dekker in his Belman of London 'conveyed’ largely from Harman; one passage, cited by Steevens, so strongly corroborates Shakespeare’s description that it may perhaps be worth the while to reprint it here (three editions of this Belman appeared in 1608, the year in which Lear was first printed): \"Of all the mad rascalls (that are of this wing) the Abraham-man is the most phantastick: The fellow (quoth the old Lady of the Lake vnto me) that sat halfe naked (at table to-day) from the girdle upward, is the best Abraham-man that euer came to my house, the notablest villaine; he sweares he hath bin in Bedlam, and will talke frantickly of purpose: you see pinnes stuck in sundry places of his native flesh, especially in his armes, which paine hee gladly puts himselfe to (beeing indeede no torment at all, his skin is either so dead with some fowle disease, ,or so hardned with weather) onely to make you beleeue he is out of his wits; he calls himselfe by the name of Poore Tom, and comming neere any body, cryes out, Poore Tom is a cold. Of these Abraham-men some be exceeding mery, and doe nothing but sing songs, fashionied out of their owne braines; some will dance, other will do nothing but laugh or weepe; others are dogged and so sullen both in looke and speech, that spying but small company in a house, they boldly and bluntly enter, compelling the seruants through feare to giue them what they demaund, which is commonly bacon, or something that will yeelde ready mony.

        "Warburton: Turlygod] We should read Turlupin. In the fourteenth century there was a new species of gipsies, called Turlupins, a fraternity of naked beggars, which ran up and down Europe. However, the Church of Rome hath dignified them with the name of Hereticks, and- actually burned some of them at Paris. [In regard to their religion Littré says: \"ils soutenaient qu’on ne doit avoir honte de rien de ce qui est naturel.\"] Plainly, says Warburton, nothing but a band of Tom-o'-bedlams.",
        "Douce: Turlygod] There is a better reason for rejecting Warburton’s Turlupin and Hanmer’s Turluru than for preferring either, viz; that ‘Turlygood’ is the corrupted word in language. The Turlupins were first known by the names Beg-hards, or Beghins, and brothers and sisters of the free spirit. The common people alone called them Turlupins, a name which seems obviously to be connected with the wolvish howlings which these people, in all probability, would make in their religious ravings. Their subsequent name of the fraternity of poor men might have been the cause why the wandering rogues, called Bedlam beggars, assumed or obtained the title of Turlupins or Turlygoods, especially if their mode of asking alms was accompanied by the gesticulations of madmen. Turlupino and Turluru are old Italian terms for a fool or madman; and the Flemings had a proverb, \"As unfortunate as Turlupin and his children.\"",

In Harsnet’s Declaration of Popish Impostures, Richard Mainy, Gent, one of the pretended demoniacs, deposes, p. 263, that the first night that he came to Denham, the seat of Mr. Peckham, where these impostures were managed, he was somewhat evill at ease, and he grew worse and worse with an old disease that he had, and which the priests persuaded him was from the possession of the Devil, viz. ‘The disease I spake of was a spice of the Mother, wherewith I had bene troubled ... before my going into Fraunce : whether I doe rightly term it the Mother or no, I know not. ... When I was sicke of this disease in Fraunce, a Scottish doctor of physick then in Paris, called it, as I remember, Vertiginem Capitis. It riseth ... of a winde in the bottome of the belly, and proceeding with a great swelling, causeth a very painful collicke in the stomack, and an extraordinary giddines in the head.’ It is at least very probable, that Sh. would not have thought of making Lear affect to have the Hysterick Passion, or Mother, if this passage in Harsnet’s pamphlet had not suggested it to him, when he was selecting the other particulars from it, in order to furnish out his character of Tom of Bedlam, to whom this demoniacal gibberish is admirably adapted.

        "Johnson, Steevens, Mason, Malone, Halliwell, Schmidt: All that follow, &c.] Johnson; There is in this sentence no clear series of thought. If he that follows his nose is led or guided by his eyes, he wants no information from his nose. I persuade myself, but know not whether I can persuade others, that Sh. wrote : “All men are led by their eyes but blind men, and they follow their noses, and there’s not a nose among twenty but can smell him that’s stinking.” Here is a succession of reasoning. You ask why the king has no more train? Why, because men who are led by their eyes see that he is ruined, and if there were any blind among them, who, for want of eyes, followed their noses, they might by their noses discover that it was no longer fit to follow the king. Steevens; “Twenty” refers to the “noses” of the “blind men,” and not to the men in general. The passage, thus considered, bears clearly the very sense which the above note endeavors to establish by alteration. For “stinking,” Mason maintained that we should read sinking, because “it would be nothing extraordinary that a nose should smell out a person that was “stinking,” What the Fool wants to describe is the sagacity of mankind in finding out the man whose fortunes are declining.” Malone, however, vindicated the present text by showing that the same simile is applied to fallen fortunes in All’s Well V, ii, 5: Mankind, says the Fool, may be divided Into those who can see and those who are blind. All men, but blind men, though they follow their noses, are led by their eyes; and this class of mankind, seeing the king ruined, have all deserted him. With respect to the other class, the blind, who have nothing but their noses to guide them, they also fly equally from a king whose fortunes are declining; for, of the noses of twenty blind men, there is not one but can smell him who, “being muddied in fortune's mood, smells somewhat strong of her strong displeasure.” Halliwell: The word “twenty” does not, I think, refer solely to the noses of the blind men. The Fool says Kent deserves to be put in the stocks for his silly question, for not looking which way the wind blows, for being too simple. He says that all men who follow their noses are led by their eyes, blind men excepted. Kent, according to his notion, has not used his eyes, and therefore he deserved the stocks. Not a nose of any kind but smells him that's stinking; and he infers that Kent had neither used his eyes to see, nor his nose to smell; in short, had not made use of his senses."

There is knavery in this desertion, but there is no folly. Collier (ed. ii) adopted this change by Johnson (which is also found in his Folio MS), and upholds it thus: \"In the old editions the very contrary of what Sh. intended is expressed. The reasoning in the earlier part of the rhyme is that, when it begins to rain, wise men fly to shelter, but fools stay; and it ought to be followed up by the statement that, if the fool runs away, he turns knave, and that the knave, being no fool, will not be so silly as to remain in the wet.\" But Collier, in his Third edition, returns to the old reading. Both Heath and Capell adopted Johnson’s change in the first of these two lines; and in the second, Heath suggested “The fcors no knave, perdy.\" White: No transposition is necessary, if, as I believe, “knave” in line 80 is used in the sense of servant, in line 81 of rogue, while “fool,” in line 80, has the reproachful sense it has in the Bible, and in line 81 is but the official title. HUDSON: The Fool seems here to be using the trick of suggesting a thing by saying the opposite. Clarke : Sh., in his own noble philosophy, here affirms that the cunning rogue who deserts his benefactor in the time of reverse, from motives of prudence, shows himself fool as well as knave, moral miscalculator as well as moral coward. Moberly : The touching faith of the Fool to his master is one of the most beautiful points of the play. The history of court-fools does not offer anything quite like it. It, however, took six strong men to drag away Patch, Cardinal Wolsey’s Fool, from his disgraced master, who wished to send him as a propitiatory offering to Henry VIII. Wright : The text requires no alteration. The Fool points out who the real fools in the world are. Coleridge said a knave is a fool with a circumbendibus.

        "Schmidt: commands her service] Schmidt thus justifies his reading, which is virtually that of the Ff: The majority of the Qq read “commands her service,” and this convenient reading has been adopted, without more ado, by the modern editors. But they failed to note that one Quarto, and probably the oldest [see (Bodl. i) in Appendix, p. 374], reads come and tends service, of course, nonsense, but yet containing nearly the same letters as the Folio; also that Lear demands service not only from Regan, but also from Cornwall, and that the circumstances, at least, would require : commands them service, which would come nearer to the ductus literarum of the true reading. As concerns this latter, it must be granted that tend, which is elsewhere so often identical with attend, is used by Sh. nowhere in the sense of await, in which sense he frequently uses attend (see II, i, 125). But this is of no material weight. Just as the prefix a is found before numberless verbs without changing their essential meaning (abate, abide, accursed, advantage, adventure, affright, affront, appertain, &c.), so, on the other hand, in the older language the prefix a (whatever may be its origin) is often omitted at will. In II, i, 30, we have had “quit thyself” as a hapax legomenon for acquit thyself. So also in IV, i, 49, “parel” for apparel. Other hapax legomena are “lege” for allege, “noyance” for annoyance, “paritor” for apparitor, “rest” (only in Com. of Err.) for arrest, “say” for assay, “stonish” for astonish, “void” (Cor. IV, v, 88) for avoid. The occurrence of the shortened form is not therefore conclusive against the use of tend in a sense with which attend does not seem hitherto to have had anything in common, especially since the meanings of the two words in other passages coincide in the majority of cases, and also since tandance is equivalent in Sh. to attendance."

        "Johnson, Steevens, Capell, Malone, Schmidt: You less know how to value her desert / Than she to scant her duty.] This passage, as Wright truly remarks, “is one of many passages in Sh. of which the sense is clear, but which it is almost impossible to paraphrase.” JOHNSON, on the ground that ‘scant’ is directly contrary to the sense intended, advocated Hanmer’s change to scan in the sense of measure or proportion. Steevens says, “Surely no alteration is necessary,” and then gives what he says is “the intended meaning of the passage”: “You less know how to value her desert, than she (knows) to scant her duty,” i.e. than she can be capable of being wanting in her duty. Capell: Had [line 135] been conceived in these words, “You more know how to lessen her desert,” then had those expressions been proper that succeed in the next line; as it is, “scant” cannot have been the word in that place; and scan bids fair to be the Poet’s intended term in its room, spoiled by printers. Malone: The inaccuracy of the expression will clearly appear from inverting the sentence without changing a word: “I have hope, says Regan, that she knows more (or better) how to scant her duty than you know how to value her desert;” i.e. I have hope that she is more perfect in the non-performance of her duty than you are perfect, or accurate, in the estimation of her merit. If Lear is less knowing in the valuation of Goneril’s desert than she is in scanting her duty, then she knows better how to scant or be deficient in her duty, than he knows how to appreciate her desert. If Sh. had written ‘I have hope that you rather know how to make her desert less than it is, (to underrate it in your estimation) than that she knows how to scant her duty,’ all would have been clear, but by placing “less” before “know” this meaning is destroyed. In Wint. Tale, III, ii, 55, we meet with a similar inaccuracy: “—I ne’er heard yet That any of these bolder vices wanted Less impudence to gainsay what they did Than to perform it first,” where, as Johnson justly observed, “wanted should be had or less should be more.” Again in Macb. III, vi, 8. SCHMIDT (Lex. p. 1420, 9) gives many similar instances of what he calls the “duplication of negative words,” as here “less know” and “scant”; e.g, Mer. of Ven. IV, i, 162: “Let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation,” equivalent to either: no motive to let him lack, or, no impediment to let him have. Again, Tro. and Cres. I, i, 28; Cor. I, iv, 14, &c. “All such irregularities,” adds SCHMIDT, “may be easily accounted for. The idea of negation was so strong in the poet's mind, that he expressed it in more than one place, unmindful of his canon that ‘your four negatives make your two affirmatives.’ Had he taken the pains to revise and prepare his plays for the press, he would perhaps have corrected all these passages. But he did not write them to be read and dwelt on by the eye, but to be heard by a sympathetic audience. [Is the levity ill-timed that suggests that perhaps Regan’s speech puzzles poor old Lear himself, quite as much as his commentators, and he has to ask her to explain; ‘Say, how is that?’—ED.]"

Collier: The (MS) tells us to read mouth, i.e. the mouth of Lear. We feel reluctant to adopt the emendation, inasmuch as, according to Warburton, the sense is pretty clear; but still it is extremely probable that the copyist, or the compositor, misheard the word, and that Lear intends to call attention to the manner in which such terms of abject submission to a child misbeseem a father’s mouth.

Sh. uses “hefts” for heavings in Wint. Tale, II, i, 45. The Qq, however, read, “tender-hested nature,” which may mean a nature which is governed by gentle dispositions. “Hest” is an old word, signifying command. Davies: I suppose the expression was intended to signify smooth, or soft-handled, consequently put here for gentleness of disposition. Knight: We doubt Steevens’s explanation. Heft,—haft,—is that which is haved,—held; and thus, \"thy tender-hefted nature\" may be thy nature which may be held by tenderness. White; Although I fail to see the appropriateness of any sense that may be extracted from either text of the Ff or Qq, I shrink from adopting the very specious reading of the earlier editors: tender-hearted. Edinburgh Review (July, 1869, p. 106) : Heft’ is a well-known older English word for handle, that which holds or contains, and “tender- hefted” is simply delicately-housed, daintily-bodied, finely-sheathed. “Heft” was in this way applied proverbially to the body, and Howell has a phrase quoted by Halliwell : loose in the heft, to designate an ill habit of body, person of dissipated ways. Schmidt [Lex.) quotes this extract, and adds: But, is haft or heft, i.e. handle, indeed that which holds or contains, or not rather that by which a thing is held? Loose in the handle, applied to a person, could not possibly mean anything else than what loose in the heft is said to have designated. Perhaps “tender-hefted,” i.e. tender-handled, is equivalent to tender, gentle, to touch or to approach; of an easy and winning address, affable. Wright: A heft or haft is a handle, and a nature tender-hefted is one which is set in a tender handle or delicate bodily frame. Regan was less masculine than Goneril. Cotgrave has, “Emmanchd: m. &e: f. Helued; set into a haft, or handle. Lasche emmanchd, Lazie, idle, slothful!, weake, feeble, loose ioynted, faint-hearted.” Prompt. Parv.: “Heftyde, manubriatus.”",

Cornwall knows not the present sound; but to Regan, who had often heard her sister’s trumpet, the first flourish of it was as familiar as was that of the Moor to the ears of Iago. Delius considers Steevens’s supposition as unlikely, because it was through the letter that Regan knew of Goneril’s approach, Delius evidently takes “this” as the object of approves."

        "Wright: main] Steevens quotes from Bacon’s Considerations touching a War with Spain (Life and Letters, ed. Spedding, vii, 490): ‘In the year that followed, of 1589, we gave the Spaniards no rest, but turned challengers, and invaded the main of Spain;’ where the context shows that he is not speaking of what was technically known as ‘the Spanish main,’ but of the landing an army on the coast of Spain itself. In the very next page Bacon says; ‘In the year 1596 was the second invasion that we made upon the main territories of Spain,’ which shows clearly what was meant by ‘the main’ in the former passage. Delius doubts that this means the land; the sense being rather that the curled waters swell above their own especial domain, the sea, and overflow the land.",
        "Jennens: main] Though all the editions have ‘main,’ it is very likely Sh. wrote moon, which is much better, because it more strongly expresses (according to Shakespeare’s custom) the confusion which Lear in his rage would have introduced into nature; besides, ‘main’ is ambiguous, applicable to sea or land. The effect of overflowing the land is not so great nor so certain confusion; the sea often does that and returns to its usual bounds; whereas the swelling of the waters above the moon is entirely preternatural, and best answers the madness of bidding the wind blow the earth into the sea. According to Schmidt (Lex.), Sh. uses ‘main’ more frequently for the sea than for the land, but here clearly for the latter."

See Cornelius Agrippa Magische Werke, ii, cap, 27; or Paracelsus Sagacis Philosophies, 1658, Lib. i, p. 532, a. In vol. ix of Dodsley’s Old Plays there is ‘Morall Masks by Thomas Nabbes, entitl. Microcosmus, 1637; in the commendatory verses both by Rich. Broome and Will. Cufaude, ‘man’ is spoken of as ‘the little world.’ I am not sure that the macrocosm is not referred to by Gloucester in IV, vi, 133: ‘O ruin’d piece of nature! This great world shall so wear out to nought,’ perhaps alluding to the bond which, as astrologers maintain, exists between the little world and the great world. In reference to the macrocosm, see notes on Faust, either in Hayward’s or Taylor’s translation, Ed.",

Mammalia, p. 232, col. 2, we read of the sperm whale that ‘when frightened it is said by the sailors to be gallied,” probably galled.’ But this is an error. Huntley (Glossary of the Cotswold Dialect) gives ‘Gallow. To alarm; to frighten.’ There is an Anglo-Saxon word gœlan, to terrify, from which it is probably derived. Herbert Coleridge (Philological Soc. Trans., 1858, p. 123) gives a derivation, proposed by M. Metivier of Guernsey, from the dialect of that island—viz, Egaulatr, signifying to dazzle, a meaning which, as Coleridge says, hardly applies to the present passage, Venables (Athenæum, 13 Nov. ’75) says this word is still used in the Isle of Wight."

I, ii, 139; Cym. III, vi, 92. 69-75: Bucknill (p. 195): mental disease in Lear] The import of this must be weighed with IV, vi, 100-104, when Lear is incoherent and full of delusion. Insanity arising from mental and moral causes often continues in a certain state of imperfect developement; a state of exaggerated and perverted emotion, accompanied by violent and irregular conduct, but unconnected with intellectual aberration; until some physical shock is incurred,— bodily illness, or accident, or exposure to physical suffering; and then the imperfect type of mental disease is converted into perfect lunacy, characterised by more or less profound affection of the intellect, by delusion or incoherence. This is evidently the case in Lear, and although we have never seen the point referred to by any writer, and have again and again read the play without perceiving it, we cannot doubt from these passages, and especially from the second, in which the poor madman’s imperfect memory refers to his suffering in the storm, that Sh. contemplated this exposure and physical suffering as the cause of the first crisis in the malady. Our wonder at his profound knowledge of mental disease increases, the more carefully we study his works; here and elsewhere he displays with prolific carelessness a knowledge of principles, half of which would make the reputation of a modern psychologist."

        "Abbott, §§ 95, 96: and] According to Abbott, emphatically, with and without participles, for also, even, and that too. \"We still use and that to give emphasis and call attention to an additional circumstance e. g. 'He was condemned and that unheard.' Here it means 'a little and that a very little.'\" 83-99: White: prophecy] I believe this is an interpolation. This loving, faithful creature would not let his old master go off half-crazed in that storm, that he might stop and utter such pointless and uncalled-for imitation of Chaucer. The absence of this prophecy from the edition of 1608, is corroborative evidence that it is an interpolation. 83-99: Cowden Clarke: prophecy] This prophecy is clearly a scrap of ribaldry tacked on, by the actor who played the Fool, to please “the barren spectators”; just one of those instances of irrelevant and extemporaneous jesting to which Sh. himself, through his character of Hamlet, so strongly objects. The fact of the Fool’s present speech occurring after Lear has left the stage alone serves to condemn it as spurious. 83-99: Koppel (p. 79): prophecy] On the other hand, thinks that this speech was added by Sh. after the text which we have in the Qq was written; 'the poet was generous to this, the most amiable of all his Fools, and even added somewhat to his part.' 83-99: Warburton: prophecy] The first, a satirical description of the present manners as future; and the second, a satirical description of future manners, which the corruption of the present would prevent from ever happening. Each of these prophecies has its proper inference or deduction; yet by an unaccountable stupidity, the first editors took the whole to be one prophecy, and so jumbled the two contrary inferences together. Accordingly, Warburton transposed lines 93, 94 to follow line 84; that concludes the first prophecy, and Warburton points the allusion to the present time by adding parenthetically after them, 'i.e. Now.' The remaining lines compose the second prophecy, and at the end of the last line Warburton adds, 'A. e. Never.' Warburton’s change was followed in the text by Hanmer, Johnson, Jennens, and Eccles. 83-99: Capell: prophecy] Capell grants Warburton’s conclusions, but denounces the transposition of the lines as 'destructive of humour, and of the speaker’s wild character which disclaims regularity.' Capell’s explanation is that Sh. wrote two speeches for the Fool, 'one comprising the whole of that prophecy which relates to things present; it’s conclusion a wagery [i.e., I suppose, the line: No heretics burn’d, &c.], at which the speaker might face about and be going, but return to speak the lines about Merlin, which lines belong with equal propriety to the prophecy about things that will not be ... it is conceiv’d, further, that these seperate [sic] prophecies were at first spoken seperately, or on seperate nights; or one drop’d for the other, and we judge the drop’d one the first; that both were found in his manuscripts, standing irregularly; and took their form from the players, who might even present them so after their author’s death.' 83-99: Steevens: prophecy] Refers to Puttenham’s Arte of Poesie, 1589, as containing these lines, [See p. 232, ed. Arber. ‘Sir Geffrey Chaucer, father of our English Poets, hath these verses following the distributor [a rhetorical term]: When faith failes in Priestes sawes, And Lords hestes are holden for lawes, And robberie is tane for purchase, And lechery for solace, Then shall the Realme of Albion Be brought to great confusion.’ The original, which is called Chaucer’s Prophecy, may be found in vol. vi, p. 307, ed.

This conjecture was not repeated in his second edition. But Dyce, commenting on it, says that Sh. has studiously made the assumed madness of Edgar somewhat akin to the comic, that it might contrast the better with the real insanity of Lear. Cowden Clarke thinks that the marked frequency of the word ‘cold’ during this scene was probably intentional, in order to sustain the impression of the inclemency of the season."

        "Theobald: knives under his pillow] To Theobald is due the credit of discovering that here, and throughout Edgar’s feigned madness, allusions are made to Harsnet’s Declaration, &c., Thus: “While the Spaniards were preparing their Armado against England, the Jesuits were here busily at work to promote the success by making converts. One method they used, to do this, was to dispossess pretended demoniacks of their own church; by which artifice they made several hundred converts among the common people, and grew so elate upon their success as to publish an account of their exploits in this wonderful talent of exorcising. A main scene of their business, in this seeming-holy discipline, lay in the family of one Mr. Edmund Peckham; where Marwood, a servant of Antony Babington’s, Trayford, an attendant upon Mr. Peckham, and Sarah and Friswood Williams, and Anne Smith (three chambermaids in that family), were supposed to be possessed by devils, and came under the hands of the priests for their cure. The parties either so little liked the discipline, or the Jesuits behaved with such ill address, that the consequence was, the imposture was discovered; the demoniacs were examined; and their confessions taken upon oath before the Privy Council. The whole matter being blown up, the criminals brought to the stake, and the trick of Devil-hunting brought into ridicule. Dr. Harsnet (who was chaplain to Archbishop Bancroft, and himself afterwards Archbishop of York) wrote a smart narrative of this whole proceeding under the following title: ‘A Declaration of egregious Popish Impostures, to withdraw the harts of her Majesties Subjects from their allegeance, and from the truth of Christian Religion professed in England, under the pretence of casting out devils. Practised by Edmunds, alias Weston a Jesuit, and divers Romish priests his wicked associates. Whereunto are annexed the Copies of the Confessions, and Examinations of the parties themselves, which were pretended to be possessed, and dispossessed, taken upon oath before her Majesties Commissioners for causes Ecclesiasticall. At London Printed by James Roberts, dwelling in Barbican 1603.'... The greatest part of Edgar's dissembled lunacy, the names of his devils, and the descriptive circumstances he alludes to in his own case, are all drawn, from this pamphlet, and the confessions of the poor deluded wretches.” In this mention of ‘knives’ and ‘halters’ there seems to be an allusion to the following passage from Harsnet (which is here given as printed by Staunton): “This examinant further saith, that one Alexander an apothecarie, having brought with him from London to Denham on a time a new halter, and two blades of knives, did leave the same upon the gallerie floare in her maister’s house. The next morning he tooke occasion to goe with this examinant into the said gallerie, where she espying the said halter and blades, asked Ma: Alexander what they did there: Hee making the matter strange, aunswered, that he saw them not, though hee looked fully upon them: she her selfe pointing to them with her finger, where they lay within a yard of them, where they stoode both together. Now (quoth this examinant) doe you not see them? and so taking them up, said, looke you heerc: Ah (quoth hee) now I see them indeed, but before I could not see them: And therefore saith he, I perceave that the devil hath layd them heere, to woikc some mischiefe upon you, that are possessed. Hereupon... a great search was made in the house, to know how the said halter and knife blades came thether: but it could not in anywayse be found out, as it was pretended, till Ma: Mainy in his next fit said, as it was reported, that the devil layd them in the Gallery, that some of those who were possessed, might either hang themselves with the halter, or kil themselves with the blades.” Examination of Friswood Williams, p. 219."

Shortly after they [the seven spirits] were all cast forth, and in such manner as Ma.

        "Steevens: plackets] When Steevens wished to treat an indelicate subject in an indelicate way, yet with a show of learning, he not infrequently signed his notes AMNER, the name of a guileless, dissenting clergyman settled not far from Steevens’s home at Hampstead. There is such a note so signed on this word. Hares defines “placket” as “a petticoat, generally an underpetticoat. ... Bailey says it was the forepart of the shift or petticoat, but it was neither. It is sometimes used for a female, the wearer of a placket, as petticoat now is.” Florio gives: “Torace … also a placket or a stomacher, a breastplate or corselet for the body.” This led Singer and others to define it simply as a stomacher. Dyce (Gloss.) has the following note: “Whether or not ‘placket’ had originally an indelicate meaning is more than I can determine. It has been very variously explained; a petticoat, an underpetticoat, a pocket attached to a petticoat, the slit or opening in a petticoat, and a stomacher; and it certainly was occasionally used to signify a female as petticoat is now. The term placket is still in use in England and America for a petticoat, and, in some of the provinces for a shift, a slit in the petticoat, a pocket, &c.” Halliwell, As to the word placket, in “An exact Chronologic of memorable things” in Wit’s Interpreter ed. 1671, it is said to be “sixty-six years since maids began to wear plackets.” According to Middleton, the placket is “the open part” of a petticoat; and the word is not altogether obsolete, since the opening in the petticoats of the present day is still called “the placket hole,” in contradistinction to the pocket hole. — Chapell’s Popular Music of the Olden Time, ii, 518. The student who wishes to pursue the subject further will find a note on it by White on the present passage, and also on Love’s Lab, III, i, 186. Schmidt (Lex.) gives the other instances of its use in Sh., and in addition see Marston’s What You Will, III, i, p. 267, ed. Halliwell: “apple squiers, basket bearers, or pages of the placket.” Middleton’s Roaring Girl, III, iii, p. 497, ed. Dyce. Middleton’s Any Thing for a Quiet Life, II, ii, p. 447, ed. Dyce: “—the open part [of a petticoat] which is now called the placket. Franklin, jun. Why, was it ever called otherwise? Gec. Yes; while the word remained pure in his original, the Latin tongue, who have no K’s, it was called the placet; a placendo, a thing or place to please.” Middleton’s The Honest Whore, Part 2, V, ii, p. 241, ed. Dyce. Beau, and Fl.’s Lovds Cure, I, ii, p. 116, ed. Dyce. Beau, and Fl.’s Humourous Lieutenant, IV, iv, p. 508, ed. Dyce. White well sums up the discussion: “It is clear at least that the placket, in Shakespeare’s time and after, was an article of female apparel so secret as not to admit description, and so common as not to require it; and that, consequently, the thing having passed out of use, the word stat nominis umbra!”"

Therefore, as different champions are supposed to cross the field, the King always discovers some objection to his attacking each of them, and repeats these two lines as every fresh personage is introduced. The song I have never seen, but had this account from an old gentleman, who was only able to repeat part of it, and died before I could have supposed the discovery would have been of the least importance to me.”",

        "Warburton: Swithold…aroint thee!] Warburton: We should read it thus: Saint Withold footed thrice the wold, He met the night-mare, and her name told. Bid her alight, and her troth plight, And aroynt thee, witch, aroynt thee! i.e. Saint Withold, traversing the wold or downs, met the night-mare; who, having told her name, he obliged her to alight from those persons whom she rides, and plight her troth to do no more mischief. This is taken from a story of him in his legend. Hence he was invoked as the patron saint against that distemper. And these verses were no other than a popular charm, or night-spell against the Epialtes. The last line is the formal execration, or apostrophe of the speaker, of the charm to the witch, “aroynt thee right,” i.e., depart forthwith. Bedlams, gipsies, and such-like vagabonds, used to sell these kinds of spells or charms to the people. They were of various kinds for various disorders, and addressed to various saints. We have another of them in B. and Fl.’s Monsieur Thomas, IV, vi, which is expressly called a night-spell, as follows: “St. George, St. George, our Lady’s knight. He walks by day, so does he by night; And when he had her found, He her beat, and her bound, Until to him her troth she plight, She would not stir from him that night.” This, says Steevens, is likewise one of the “magical cures” for the incubus, quoted, with little variation, by Reginald Scott in his Discovery of Witchcraft, 1584.",
        "Theobald: Swithold…aroint thee!] Theobald: My ingenious friend Mr Bishop saw that “old” must be “wold,” which signifies a down, or champion ground, hilly and void of wood.

Hill, it is quoted “the corld,” [“the reading of Tate’s version.”—Steevens].

Matthew, of the New Shakespeare Society’s Committee, who is editing the unprinted English Works of Wiclif for the Early English Text Soc., has come across two instances of what must surely be Shakespeare’s aroint—the verb arunte, avoid—in a Wycliffite tract in the MS C. v. 6, Trinity Coll., Dublin, lately lent to him by the College: “And her^ sculd men arunte feynt penytauhers, co^jfessours and o]per pr^'stis jJSLt assoylen for money” (Leaf 157, back). “And here schul men arunte feend Jjat stirih men to last In his erroure” (Leaf 159, back). “I think,” says Mr Matthew, “there is no doubt that ‘arunte,’ which here evidently means ‘avoid or shun,’ is the ‘aroint’ of Macbeth I, iii, 6, and Lear, III, iv, 118, which has hitherto not been met with out of Sh.” The change from u to oi is not easy, but has surely taken place here."

These were all in poor Sara at a chop, with these the poore soule travailed up and downe full two yeeres together; so as during these two yeeres, it had beene all one to say, one is gone to hell, or hee is gone to Sara Williams; for shee poore wench had all hell in her belly.”—Cap. x, pp. 45, 50.",

When madness has taken possession of a person, such character ceases to be fit for the stage, or, at least, should appear there but for a short time ; it being the business of the theatre to exhibit passions, not distempers. The finest picture ever drawn, of a hjead discomposed by misfortune, is that of King Lear. His thoughts dwell on the ingratitude of his daughters, and every sentence that falls from his wildness excites reflection and pity.

        "Child Rowland] Capell : Every observing reader of Spenser, and of the writers of his class, knows that ‘ Child * is a common appellative of the knight in romances; deriv’d from the first gross importers of them into our language from out the Spanish and French, in which he is call’d enfant and infante ; and all know that ‘ Rowland’ is only Roland pronounc’d rustically, and Roland a contraction of Orlando, so that * Child Rowland ’ is the knight Sir Orlando. Percy (note on Child Waters, vol. iii, p. 58, 1765) cites with approval Warbueton’s note on this passage, to the effect that ^ in the old times of chivalry the noble youth who were candidates for knighthood, during the time of their probation, were called Infans, Varlets, Damoysels, Racheliers, The most noble of the youth were particularly called Infa^isl Steevens: Beau, and FI. in The Woman's Prke [II, i] refer to this: «a mere hobby- horse She made Child Rowland,’ Nares; Childe Harold has lately made the term very familiar, 174, 176. Capell, despite the fact that it is an assumed madman who speaks these lines, maintained that we should not only make sense of them, but show ^ their particular propriety,’ He was convinced that * never any Orlando ’ said ‘ Fie, foh, fum.’ Therefore a line must have been omitted, and in that line ‘the smeller-out’ of Child Rowland must have been mentioned. Accordingly, he ‘perfected’ the stanza, and, although he thought it presumptuous to insert his ov/n line in Shakespeare’s text, yet ‘ the world may not be displeas’d to see it done in a note, and that in sense and rime too, as follows : [it should be premised that he adopted, instead of ‘ came ’ of the Ff, co7fie of the Qq, i, e. being come] “ Child Rowland to the dark tower come, The giant roar’d, and out he ran; His word was,” ’ &c. Having thus settled the ‘sense’ of the passage, Capell reveals ‘its propriety,’ by explaining that ‘“Child Rowland” is Edgar himself; the “dark tower,” his hovel; and the Jiefo- fiun giant, his father Gloster; who, he fears, might have the giant’s sagacity, and accost him in no less dreadful a manner.’ Keightley proposed, ‘ The Giant saw him, and out he ran.’ Ritson thought that the first line was a translation of some French or Spanish ballad, but that the last two lines belonged to a different subject. Dyce, however, in his Few Notes, p. 146, spealcs of all three lines as one ballad, of which ‘ (probably with some variations from the original) fragments of a Scottish version have been preserved by Jamieson in Illustr, of Northern Antiquities, See. 1814. Hegives (p. 402) ; “ With fi, fi, fo, and fum ! I smell the blood of a Christian man I Be he dead, be he living, wi’ my brand I’ll clash his barns frae his harn-pan ’ ” (i. e. I’ll knock his brains out of his skull),’ Halliwell believes [with Ritson] that ‘ Edgar quotes from two different compositions, the first line from a ballad on Rowland, the second from Jack and the Gia?its q the original source of the popular words Fie, foh, and fum is unknown. They are alluded to in Peele’s Old Wives Tale, 1595, “ Fee, fa, fum,—Here is the Englishman,—Conquer him that can.” Again, in Nash’s Have With You to SaffronWalden, 1596,—“O, ’tis a precious apothegmaticall pedant, who will finde matter inough to dilate a whole daye of the first invention of Fy,fa, fum, I smell the bloud of an Englishman.” The probability is that the distich quoted by Nash and Sh. belongs to some early version of the tale of Jack and the Giants. [Halliwell thinks that the earliest known edition of this story is 1771, or possibly 1741, Halliwell also gives the story of Child Rowland from Jamieson’s Illustr, of North. Antiquities, p. 397; it is also given in Child’s admirable E^tg. and Scottish Ballads, i, 416.] Wright; The substitution of ‘Britishman’ (ox Englishman points to the time when, under James I, the name of England was merged in the more general title of Great Britain. See IV, vi, 249 [where Ff have ‘ English ’ and the Qq have British. See also Appendix, p. ."

        "Capell: bourn] Capell was the first to change Broome of the Qq to \"boorne;\" this he did on the authority of the original song, which he printed, in his School, Sec., p. 73, from a black letter Qto, n. d., by W. Wager, called The longer thou livest, the more Fool thou art, thus: \"Here entreth Moros, counterfaiting a vaine gesture, and a foolish countenance, Synging the foote [i.e. the burden] of many Songes, as fooles were wont ... Com’ over the Boome Besse, My little pretie Besse Com over the Boome besse to me.\" Steevens says this song was entered on the Stationers’ Registers in 1564. But an earlier instance of this song was discovered by Collier This and what follows from the Fool are certainly parts of an old song, which was imitated by W. Birch in his \"Dialogue between Elizabeth and England\" (printed by W. Pickering without date), which thus commences: \"Come over the bourn, Bessy, come over the bourn, Bessy, Sweet Bessy, come over to me; And I shall thee take, And my dear lady make Before all that ever I see,\" It is in the same measure as the addition by the Fool. See also Old Ballads, &c., Percy Society, 1840. Wright says the date of Birch’s song is 1558, and that it is printed in full in the Harleian Misc. x, 260. WHITE refers to the curious fact that in the Merry Wives Master Brook’s name is invariably spelled Broome in the Folio, which Collier’s (MS) revealed to be a misprint for Bourne,",

The author of The Court of Conscience, or Dick Whipper’s Sessions, 1607, describing beggars, idle rogues, and counterfeit madmen, thus speaks of these associates; \"Another sort there is among you; they Do rage with furie as if they were so frantique They knew not what they did, but every day Make sport with stick and flowers like an antique; Stowt roge and harlot counterfeited gomme; One calls herself poor Besse the other Tom.\" Halliwell gives the music of this song from a sixteenth-century MS in the Brit.

Mag. lx, 402] conjectures that this is an address to an imaginary dog: \"Sessy, or cesse, is still used in some counties to encourage dogs to come out of kennel,\" See., \"so here it may mean to encourage a dog to follow him to wakes,\" See., for the sake of the good provisions to be found there.

        "Malone: horn] A \"horn\" was usually carried about by every Tom of Bedlam, to receive such drink as the charitable might afford him, with whatever scraps of food they might give him. When, therefore, Edgar says his horn is dry, or empty, I conceive he merely means, in the language of the character he assumes, to supplicate that it may be filled with drink. See Pleasant Dispute between Coach and Sedan, 1636: \"Tom-a Bedlam may sooner eate his horn, than get it filled with small drinke; and for his old almes of bacon there is no hope in the world.\" A horn so commonly meant a drinking-cup that Coles’s first explanation of it is in that sense: \"A horn: Vas corneum.\"",
        "Douce: horn] An opportunity here presents itself of suggesting a more correct mode of exhibiting the theatrical dress of Poor Tom than we usually see, on the authority of Randle Holme in The Academy of Armory, iii, 16r, where he says that the Bedlam has \"a long staff and a cow or ox-horn by his side; his cloathing fantastic and ridiculous; for, being a madman, he is madly decked and dressed all over with rubins, feathers, cuttings of cloth, and what not, to make him seem a madman or one distracted, when he is no other than a dissembling knave,\"",
        "Dyce: horn] The following account from Aubrey’s unpublished Natural History of Wiltshire was, I believe, first cited by D’Israeli in his Curiosities of Literature. I now give it as quoted by Mr Halliwell from Royal Soc. Ms: \"Till the breaking out of the Civill Warres, Tom b Bedlams did trauell about the countery. They had been poore distracted men that had been putt into Bedlam, where recovering to some sobernesse, they were licentiated to goe a begging. E. G. they had on their left arm an armilla of tinn, printed in some workes, about four inches long; they could not get it off: they wore about their necks a great horn of an oxe in a string or bawdric, which, when they came to an house for almes, they did wind; and they did putt the drink given them into this horn, whereto they did putt a stopple...\" [See also II, iii, 14.]"

        "Delius: [100–113] If we oppose this view [of the Cam. Edd.], it is because we cannot comprehend how a spurious passage appeared in the Qq; for we can hardly ascribe the authorship of the supposed interpolation to the publisher, considering what we know of him and his method of work. Neither can we suppose that he would attempt to amplify and improve the MS before him of King Lear, as it was then performed. But even the internal evidence, from which the Cam. Edd. might be inclined to condemn Edgar’s monologue, fails to convince us of its spuriousness. We readily admit that the style is not that of the rest of the drama; but this difference may be explained in two ways, partly by the form, and partly by the matter. Sh. is fond of introducing such, rhyming lines, formed of a number of pointed, epigrammatic, antithetical sentences. They stand out from the surrounding blank verse, and point the moral of the preceding situation, and the actions of the various characters. The second explanation is, that the poet lays great stress on the parallelism existing between the families of Lear and Gloucester, and takes this opportunity of impressing it again upon his audience. A mere interpolator would hardly have known of this peculiar tendency of the poet, or have carried it out so thoroughly, and in so pregnant a manner, as in the few but thoroughly Shaksperian words: \"He childed as I father’d.\" For the same reason it is more than improbable that Sh. should have cut out this passage [Delius is arguing that the omissions in the Ff were not by Sh., but by the actors], thereby thwarting his own purpose."

        "Johnson: Yet better thus, and known] The meaning is, ‘ ’Tis better to be thus contemned and known to yourself to be contemned.’ Or, perhaps, there is an error, which may be rectified thus: ‘Yet better thus unknown to be contemned.’ When a man divests himself of his real character he feels no pain from contempt, because he supposes it incurred only by a voluntary disguise which he can throw off at pleasure. I do not think any correction necessary. Sir Joshua Reynolds: The meaning seems to be this; ‘Yet it is better to be thus in this fixed and acknowledged contemptible state, than, living in affluence, to be flattered and despised at the same time.’ He who is placed in the worst and lowest state has this advantage: he lives in hope, and not in fear, of a reverse of fortune. The lamentable change is from affluence to beggary. He laughs at the idea of changing for the worse who is already as low as possible. Collier: ‘Unknown,’ which is from the (MS), accords with Johnson’s suggestion, and is certainly right. ‘Yes’ for Yet may be doubted, but we feel authorized to insert it by the excellence of the ensuing, and more important emendation. Edgar enters, giving his assent to some proposition he has stated to himself before he came upon the stage. Singer (in N. Qu, l Ser. vi, 6, 1852) expressed his approval of Johnson’s emendation, but afterwards, in his ed. 2, withdrew it.

In my opinion it is precisely Gloucester’s dependants who are meant. We have heard of no lords who were dependent on the king. He had certain knights, and of these five or six and thirty had come to seek him, and, under the guidance of some of Gloucester’s followers, they had all hurried off to Dover. If it were Lear’s own knights and his own lords dependent who had him in charge, what do Cornwall and Regan mean by asking Gloucester to whom he had sent the lunatic king, and whither he had sent him? I cannot but think that these questions must refer to Gloucester's agency in the matter implied by his having dispatched the king under the escort of some of his own followers.—Ed.] Schmidt says that they were vassals of Cornwall who had declared for Lear and betaken themselves to the French army."

        "Delius: means secure us] [Agrees substantially with Knight.]",
        "F. W. J. (N, I Ser. viii, 4, 1853): means secure us] [Following Knight’s interpretation, paraphrases:] ‘When I had eyes I walked carelessly; when I had the “means” of seeing and avoiding stumbling-blocks, I stumbled and fell, because I walked without care and watchfulness. Our deficiencies, our weaknesses (the sense of them), make us use such care and exertions as to prove advantages to us.’ As parallel, the following passages in the Bible are cited; i Cor, x, 12; Ps , x, 6; 2 Cor, xii, 9, 16. Also, “Secure thy heart.” Timon II, ii, 184. [The following excellent illustration is given:] ‘The means of the hare (i.e. her swiftness) secured her; the defects of the tortoise (her slowness) proved her commodity.’ To the same effect Wordsworth (Sh. Knowledge of the Bible, 248): 'Means,’ in Gloucester’s case, is his sight.",
        "W. R. Arrowsmith (N, & Qu, I Ser. xii, p. 1855): means secure us] Argues that ‘means’ here bears the same meaning that it does in common parlance. ‘If man’s power were equal to his will, into what excesses might he not be betrayed, ruinous to himself, as well as hurtful to others; but happily for him an over-ruling Providence so orders matters that man’s means, his circumscribed and limited means, become his security, keep him safe.’",
        "White: means secure us] ‘Secure’ here means to render careless,—a radical sense,—as it does in Timon II, ii, 184.",
        "Halliwell: means secure us] The term ‘means’ is here used for the want of means; the low state of our means. This usage is not unusual in writers of the time.",
        "Wright: means secure us] Things we think meanly of, our mean or moderate condition, are our security. Although as an adjective ‘secure’ often means ‘careless,’ I know of no instance of the verb meaning ‘to render careless.’",
        "Moberly: means secure us] ‘Secure us’ means ‘make us over-secure,’ as we have ‘a secure fool,’ ‘not jealous nor secure,’ &c. &c. The antithesis then becomes ‘while we are made careless by the advantages on which we reckoned, we are saved by something which seemed a weak point.’ The allusion may be to the fable of the stag, endangered by the horns which he admired, and saved by the legs which he despised.",
        "Schmidt: means secure us] Schmidt gives two instances of the use of ‘secure’ as a verb meaning to render careless: one is the passage in Tim. II, ii, 184, already cited by F. W. J. and White; and the other is Oth. I, iii, 10: “do not so secure me in the error.” Furthermore, Schmidt says that the signification of “means” as “moderate condition” is unknown in Sh., and perhaps in the whole range of the English language. [The various emendations that have been proposed are as follows:] Theobald (Sh. Rest. p. 177) conjectured ‘Our means ensnare us’; but did not afterwards repeat it in his edition. Hanmer’s text reads: ‘Meanness secures us.’ Johnson: I do not remember that mean is ever used as a substantive for low fortune, which is the sense here required, nor for mediocrity, except in the phrase, the “golden mean.” I suspect the passage of corruption, and would read: ‘Our means seduce us,’ or ‘Our maims secure us.’ That hurt or deprivation which makes us defenceless proves our safeguard. This is very proper in Gloucester, newly maimed by the evulsion of his eyes. Hunter (New Illust. ii, 272) proposed, without comment other than that the passage as it now stands cannot be right, ‘Our meanness succours us.’ Anon. (Gent. Mag., Aug. 1845, p. 117): Does the exact point of corruption in the text lie in “means” or “our?” Can it be “Poor means secure us,” &c.? A. E. B[rae] (N. Qu. 1 Ser. vii, 592, 1853): There are two verbs, one in every-day use, the other obsolete, which, although of nearly opposite significations, and of very dissimilar sound, nevertheless differ only in the mutual exchange of place in two letters: these verbs are secure and recuse; the first implying assurance, the second, want of assurance, or refusal. Hence any sentence would receive an opposite meaning from one of these verbs to what it would from the other. In the present passage one would suppose that the obvious opposition between means and defects would have preserved these words from being tampered with; and that, on the other hand, the absence of opposition between secure and commodious would have directed attention to the real error. But no: all the worritting has been about means. Read, therefore, ‘Our means recuse us,’ &c. Singer (ed. 2): Meanes of the old copy is possibly a typographical error for needes; the words being easily confounded in old MSS. The context shows that needs was probably what Sh. wrote. [‘Needs’ is in Singer’s text.] Collier (ed, 2): Meanes is corrected to wants in the (MS), and so we print with confidence; the context shows that the emendation is required, however much misplaced ingenuity may insist that the old text ought to be preserved. Walker (Crit. iii, 281): There can be no doubt that Johnson’s maims is the right reading. One of the numberless passages which illustrate the old pronunciation of ea, Lettsom [Foot-note to the foregoing]: Hooker’s Ecclesiastical Polity, b. v, sect. lxv; “If men of so good experience and insight in the maims of our weak flesh, have thought,” &c. b. V, sect, xxiv, 3: “In a minister, ignorance and disability to teach is a maim.” Greene, James the Fourth, Dyce, vol. ii, p. 145; “But, sir Divine to you; look on your maims. Divisions, sects, your simonies, and bribes,” &c. Hudson adopts maims."

        "Steevens: stick] Steevens: Rash of the Qq is the old hunting term for the stroke made by a wild boar with his tusks. It occurs in Spenser, Faerie Queene, b. IV, c. ii: “And shields did share, and mailes did rash, and helmes did hew.” Again in b. V, c. iii: “Rashing off helmes, and ryving plates asunder.” Dyce (Remarks, &c. p. 229) quotes the following note by Gifford: “To rash (a verb which we have improvidently suffered to grow obsolete) is to strike obliquely with violence, as a wild boar does with his tusk. It is observable with what accuracy Sh. has corrected the old Quarto of King Lear, where, instead of rash, it has properly given ‘stick.’— Note on ‘Sir, I mist my purpose in his arm, rash’d his doublet sleeve,’ &c.—Jonson’s Every Man Out of his Humour, IV, iv. Walker (Crit. iii, 280) cites from Chapman’s Iliads V, p. 63 [old fol.]: “Then rush’d he out a lance at him,” &c. Lettsom in a foot-note says: “Gifford speaks of Shakespeare’s correcting the Quarto, as if that were an ascertained fact, whereas it is only the doubtful supposition of certain editors. Chapman’s rush seems only another form of rash. Both seem applied to the weapon indicting the injury.”",
        "Johnson: cruels else subscribe] Johnson: Yielded, submitted to the necessity of the occasion. Heath: That is, submitted their cruelty to the compassion they felt at the sight of his wretchedness, Capell: That is, subscrib’d to pity, subscrib’d or assented to it’s being exercis’d here. Collier, Dyce, and Singer adopt Johnson’s interpolation, Knight, Staunton, and White are silent. Cowden Clarke says “cruels” is used for cruelties, as does also Wright, who refers to Abbott, §9, for adjectives used as nouns. Abbott, § 433: That is, “All cruel acts to the contrary being yielded up, forgiven.” Compare for the meaning, IV, vii, 36, and for “subscribe,” Tro. and Cress. IV, v, 105. Another explanation is, “all other cruel animals being allowed entrance.” Jervis (p. 23) conjectures quarrels. Moberly: All harshness otherwise natural being forborne or yielded from the necessity of the time. Schmidt: ‘All cruels’ can mean nothing else but all cruel creatures. In turning adjectives into nouns, the old language went very far, but in no instance farther than Sh. went in this phrase. In the singular, ‘cruel’ is found in Son, cxlix: “Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not?” The examples adduced by Abbott refer also to the singular. At all events it is proved by them (as well as by the passages cited in the present writer’s Lexicon, p. 1415) that the cruel, as a substantive, can only mean the cruel person or thing, not cruelty; as little can the old mean old age, or the young mean youth. All interpretations, therefore, which involve this abstract idea are inadmissible. Even those editors who interpret “cruels” correctly adopt subscribed of the Qq, and hold it to be the imperfect tense. It is far better to follow the Folio and to interpret the sentence thus: “Everything, which is at other times cruel, shows feeling or regard; you alone have not done so.” Sh. uses the phrase to subscribe to something in the sense of declaring one’s self conquered by something, of yielding, complying. It is used exactly in the same sense as here in Tro. and Cress. IV, v, 105: “For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes To tender objects,” that is, Hector yields if he is brought face to face with anything touching or tender; he is sensible to tender impressions. [This is to me the most puzzling phrase in this play, more puzzling even than “runaways’ eyes” or “the dram of eale”; the multitude of emendations proposed for these latter show how easily the idea of the phrase is grasped; anybody, and everybody, is ready with an emendation there; here it is different. None of the interpretations are, to my mind, satisfactory. The latest, Mr Joseph Crosby’s (Epitome of Lit., i June, 1879), refers “cruels” to feelings, (which is, to me, “far wide,”) and emphasizes “else.” He thus paraphrases: “All thy feelings, no matter how cruel or inhuman ‘else’, i.e. at any other time, or under any other circumstances, having ‘subscribed’, i.e. succumbed, to the terrors of that storm, and yielded to the pity for the old king, thy father.” In a case as puzzling as this, anything, as Dr Johnson says elsewhere, may be tried; my attempt is seen in the text. Not unnaturally, I think it is the true reading; it adheres to the venerable authority of the First Folio, making “subscribe” an imperative like ‘turn.’ The drift of the whole passage is the contrast between the treatment which Regan’s father had received and that which would have been dealt, in that stern time, to wolves and other animals, howsoever cruel. “Thou shouldst have said: Good porter, open the gates, acknowledge the claims of all creatures, however cruel they may be at other times;” or, perhaps: “open the gates; give up all cruel things else,” i.e. forget that they are cruel. As in I, ii, 24, Lear ‘subscribed’ his powers, so here the porter should “subscribe all cruels,” i.e. he should surrender, yield, give up whatsoever was cruel in the poor beasts, and see only their claim to his compassion. An exactly parallel use of “subscribe” cannot perhaps be found in Sh.; and if this be deemed fatal to my interpretation, I can only express my regret, and meekly suggest that the present instance may be a hapax legomenon.—Ed.]"

        "Capell: The blinding of Gloucester.] The barbarity exercised upon Gloucester is indeed a part of the story that was the source of this episode, for that “Paphlagonian king's” eyes were put out by a son; but the putting-out of poor Gloucester’s seems to be more immediately copy’d from Selimus, Steevens: In Selimus, Emperor of the Turks, one of the sons of Bajazet pulls out the eyes of an Aga on the stage, and says: “Yes thou shalt live, but never see that day, Wanting the tapers that should give thee light.” (Pulls out his eyes)[.] Immediately after, his hands are cut off. I have introduced this passage to show that Shakespeare’s drama was not more sanguinary than that of his contemporaries. Malone: In Marston’s Antonio’s Revenge, 1602, Piero’s tongue is torn out on the stage. Davies (Dram. Misc., ii, 197): After all, Sh. might possibly contrive not to execute this horrible deed upon the stage, though it is so quoted in the book. ... At the present, the sufferer is forced into some adjoining room; and the ears of the audience are more hurt by his cries than their eyes can be when he is afterwards led on the stage. The gold-beaters’ skin, applied to the sockets, as if to staunch the bleeding, abates something perhaps of the hideousness of the spectacle. Coleridge: “What can I say of this scene?—There is my reluctance to think Shakespeare wrong, and yet—” Elsewhere Coleridge says: “I will not disguise my conviction that in this one point the tragic in this play has been urged beyond the outermost mark and ne plus ultra of the dramatic.” Tieck (vol. ix, p. 368, ed. 1833): This scene, which is manifestly too horrible, and shocks our very senses, is rendered still worse by the explanation and the scenery that are intruded. Almost always when, now-a-days, such a scenic representation is attempted, false methods are employed, because the architecture and arrangements of the old theatre are not kept in mind, but confounded with our modern constructions. ... The chair, in which Gloster is bound, is the same from which, elevated in the centre of the scene, Lear first speaks. ... This lesser stage, in the centre, when not used was hidden by a curtain, that was drawn aside whenever it was necessary. Thus Sh., like all the dramatists of the time, often had two scenes at once. The nobles in Henry VIII are standing in the ante- chamber, the curtain is drawn, and we are directly in the chamber of the king. So also, when Cranmer has to wait in the ante-chamber, the council-room opens. Thus there was this advantage, that through the pillars, which separated this little stage in the centre from the proscenium or stage proper, there could be represented not only a double action, but also at the same time it might be half or partly hidden, and so two scenes might be represented which were perfectly intelligible, although not everything on the lesser stage was visible. Thus Gloster sate, probably out of sight, while Cornwall, near him, was seen, Regan standing in the fore-stage, lower than Cornwall, but close by him, with the attendants on the stage itself. Cornwall, horribly enough, tears out Gloster’s eye, but the act is not positively seen; some of the servants, holding the chair, stand in the way, and the curtain on one side (for it was divided into two) was drawn before the spectator. The expression that Cornwall uses, “Upon these eyes of thine I’ll set my foot,” is not to be taken literally; it certainly is not so intended. During the speech of Cornwall’s, one of the servants rushes up to the higher stage and wounds him; Regan, who is below, snatches a sword from another attendant and stabs the servant from behind. The groups are all in motion, and, while attention is distracted, Gloster loses his other eye. His cry is heard, but he is not seen. He disappears, for there was egress from the lesser stage also. Cornwall and Regan come forward and retire by the side scene, and the scene ends with the talk of some of the attendants. It is in this way, which somewhat lessens its horror, that the scene pictures itself to my mind. The Poet trusted, indeed, to the strong minds of his friends who were to be so much moved by the general horrors of the representation, as not to linger over the bloody particulars, Ulrici (p. 458): To have the scene where Cornwall puts out Gloster’s eyes represented directly on the stage, can only arouse a feeling of disgust, which has nothing in common with the idea of beauty, nor with that of grandeur, power, or sublimity, and which, consequently, can only impair the effect of the tragedy. Whether or not the nerves of Shakespeare’s public may have been of a stronger fibre than those of the present generation,—it is not the business of art to consider strong or weak nerves, but to aim only at the strengthening, the refreshing, and elevating of the mind and feelings, and such scenes do not effect this even in the case of the strongest nerves. Heraud (Inner Life of Sh. p. 304): In this scene Pity and Terror, the especial elements of the Tragic, are urged to their utmost limits. Of course there was danger of excess. But Sh. was on his guard. He might have justified the act by the supposed barbarity of the legendary age whose manners he was tracing, and urged that their familiarity with such acts prevented the actors in them from recognising the horrible. No such thing. By inserting in the group a servant who did recognise its intrinsic horror, and compassionated the sufferer, he converted disgust into pity. The other servants also compassionate the blind old man, and lead him out to help him, to heal his wounds, and to place him in safe custody. The entire current of feeling is turned in the direction of pity by the force of sympathy. Thus the horror in the “horrid act” is mitigated, and reduced to the level of terror, which feeling is enforced by “the fearful looking-for” of a coming vengeance, of which an instalment is secured even in the moment of crime. And this sentiment, too, is expressed by the servants who act as chorus to the scene. W. W. Lloyd: The horrors, like the indelicacies that are met with in Shakespeare’s plays, are never admitted for their own sakes, never but when absolutely indispensable for his great aim and purpose, the defining of character, and that complete exhibition of nature with which,—recognising in art the same rigour that is challenged by science,—he allowed nothing to interfere. The mere convenience of stage-management, it might be said, would dictate that Gloucester should sit in the chair with his back to the audience, and it is not even then very apparent why the deed of mutilation should be so much more shocking than the smothering and the death agonies of Desdemona; it is not worth denying, however, that if only by usage of theatrical associations it would be so, and if, as I believe, the painfulness and the horror would not be utterly insupportable, it must be from a different cause. The cruel act is revolting to think of, and much more to behold, and yet is the revolting cruelty less heinous than the treatment of Lear, though there the physical injury was comparatively slight,—the exposure of age and weakness to a pitiless storm,—and in itself, however well the storm might be imitated, less harrowing to the feelings. But Sh. evidently relied upon the response of the sympathies of his audience to the appeal of his art, and he had confidence in his power to depict the mental anguish, and sufferings, and injuries of the king with such force that no inferior infliction could supersede it in our interest. If the heart is touched as it should be by the great scene of the storm, and then by the pitiable spectacle of the wit-wrecked monarch in the indoors scene, mingling the fantastic freaks of lunacy with the majesty of sorrow, we shall be aware that the mere narration of any physical suffering or cruelty whatever must have failed to rouse another start of indignation. To any other excitement the sensibilities might well seem lulled or seared, and the exhibition of the act was therefore necessary if it was to take place at all, and was therefore possible; and the poet daringly and successfully availed himself of the opportunity to cast the last disgrace upon filial ingratitude, by exposing its surpassing hatefulness in comparison with the direst crime, acted under our eyes with every detail of horror."

The fact is, that this interpolated part of the plot is one of the many instances of Shakespeare’s homage to Sir Philip Sidney; to pay which he does not hesitate to make a certain sacrifice of probability. In the Arcadia (p. 160) we have “a prince of Paphlagonia, who, being ill-treated by his son, goes to the top of a high rock to cast himself down.” (But how slight is the hint in the romance compared with the magnificent use which Shakespeare makes of it!) So in Pericles, i, i, we have taken from Sidney’s Arcadia (p. 149) the expression, “The Senate-house of planets all did sit, To knit in her their best perfections.” And in As You Like It, the celebrated passage about “tongues in trees,” &c., is an adaptation from Sidney’s Astrophel."

[Of course this attack on Jonson aroused all Gifford’s bitterness, and in a note on the passage in The Case is Altered, after quoting these notes by Steevens and Malone just given, he says: “Malone exposes Steevens’s dishonesty with respect to the priority of the present drama, but, unwilling to lose a charge against Jonson, seeks to bolster up his crazy accusation by a supposition as full of malice as the other is of falsehood. ... And all this grovelling in baseness (for it is no better) is founded on a harmless allusion to a method of cure common, in Jonson’s time, to every barber-surgeon and old woman in the kingdom.” Boswell, Malone’s cordial friend, says plaintively: “I wish Gifford had not expressed his dissent in such strong language.”— Ed.]"

This also serves as an apology for her own precipitation, and a censure upon the pusillanimity in her husband. It may indeed be objected to this interpretation that she appears thereby to stamp villainy upon her own conduct, but her words may imply: ‘We have mischief in hand, which it is expedient to effect; if so, the more speedily it is accomplished the better; for, even if our proceeding merited your imputation, stiU it is to be con- sidered that only “Fools do the.'^e villains pity,”’ &c. Malone: It is not clear whether this fiend means her father or the King of France. If her words have a retrospect to Albany’s speech, which the word * pity ’ might lead us to suppose, Lear must be referred to ; if they are considered as connected with what follows, ‘Where's thy drum ? ’ &c,, the other interpretation must he adopted. The latter appears to me the true one, and perhaps the punctuation of the Qq, in which there is only a comma after ‘mischief,’ ought to have been preferred. Singer : Surely there cannot be a doubt that she refers to her father, and to the ‘ pity ’ for his sufferings expressed by Albany, whom she means indirectly to call a ‘fool ’ for expressing it. [She cannot refer to Gloucester, because Albany is ignorant of what had been done to him, and she herself had left Gloucester’s castle before the blinding was accomplished. It is difEcuIt to believe that she refers to Lear; may it not he that ‘she refers to Albany himself? She has told him that his preachment about her father was foolish, and"

Malone: Thou who hast put a covering on thyself which nature did not give thee. The covering which Albany means is, the semblance and appearance of a fiend. Ste^vens : Perhaps there is an allusion to the envelope which the maggots of some insects furnish to themselves. Voss (iii, 643, Leipzig, 1819) suggests y9//-coverM: ‘ Albany refers to the expression of satanic unwon.an- liness which covers her face like a dark cloud.’ Hudson : An obscure expression, but probably meaning, thou who hast hid the woman in the fiend, or who hast changed from what thou rightly art, and covered or lost thy proper self under an usurped monstrosity; Cartwright: Read ‘chang’d and discover'd thing,’ &c. She has just openly exposed her character. Delius: That is, a thing whose genuine self (in this case, therefore, whose fiendish self) is concealed, covered. Cowden Clarke : Thou perverted creature, who hast covered thyself with the hideousness only proper to a fiend. Singer (ed. 2) : This is evidently a misprint for falfe-couer'd. What follows clearly shows it : ‘ Howe’er thou art a fiend, A woman''s shape doth shield thee.’ Collier (ed. 2) : The (MS) offers no emendation; but we may express our confidence that Shakespeare’s word was ‘ %€d- govern^d^ which was misheard by the sciibe, or by the compositor, ‘self-cover’d’—a compound out of which it is only just possible to extract a consistent meaning. Albany complains of the changed and self- willed disposition of Goneril. J. Beale (AC 6^ Qu, 5 th Ser. vol. vi, p. 303, 1876) suggests ‘ i/<fz/z7-cover’d.’ John Bulloch {Ibid.) : The proper reading is a term connected with the law of marriage: * self-covertl Schmidt (Lex.) : Dressed in one’s native semblance.

Lastly, it supplies the antithetic point in Goneril’s reply : “ Many, your manhood, now I ” ’ Furthermore, Crosby finds in the word ‘ feature ’ another meaning besides its usual one (see the next note), viz : sex or womanhood. This, he says, is in ‘ full unison with its etymology from the Lat. facere^ and refers to that * which distinguished Goneril’s making from that of a man.* ‘ Be-monster not thy feature * therefore * means Make not a monster of thy sex,** change not thy woman’s form into a devil.

As a woman GoneriPs shape * covers, i, e, protects, her from her husband’s immediate fury.’ [This emendation Crosby proposed in N. dr= Qu, 5th Ser. vi, 225, 1876, and no one, I think, can fail to be struck with its ingenuity, ‘and yet—.’ Is it over-refinement to suppose that this revelation to Albany of his wife’s fiendlike character transforms, in his eyes, even her person? She is changed, her true self has been covered; now that she stands revealed, her whole outward shape is be-mon- stered. No woman, least of all Goneril, could remain unmoved under such scathing words from her husband. Goneril’s ‘ feature ’ is quivering and her face distorted with passion. Then it is that Albany tells her not to let her evil self, hitherto cov- ered and concealed, betray itself in all its hideousness in her outward shape.

        "like a better way] Warburton proposed ‘a wetter May, i.e. a spring season wetter than ordinary;’ and Theobald supported the conjecture by citing [19. like a better way,] Shakespeare’s ‘May of youth.’ Much Ado, V, i, 76; ‘sweet May.’ Mich. Hr V, i, 79; ‘rose of May.’ Ham, IV, v, 153; &c. Heath proposed ‘an April day’, because the ‘joint appearance of rain and sunshine’ was more characteristic of that month than of May. In Theobald’s second edition, although Warburton’s change is still retained in the text, yet the phrase is cited in the note as ‘a better day’. This emendation was adopted, without credit, by Steevens in his edition of 1773; in his edition of 1778 he says: A better day is the best day, and the best day is a day most favourable to the productions of the earth. Such are the days in which there is a due admixture of rain and sunshine. The comparative is used by Milton and others, instead of the positive and superlative, as well as by Sh. himself in the play before us: ‘The safer sense,’ &c. IV, vi, 81; ‘better part of man,’ Mach, V, viii, 18. The thought is taken from Sidney’s Arcadia, p. 244: ‘Her tears came dropping down like rain in sunshine.’ - Cordelia’s behaviour is apparently copied from Philoclea’s. The same book, in another place, says: ‘her tears followed one another like a precious rope of pearl.’ In this same edition of Steevens in 1778 a note is given by Tollet in which he suggests that ‘a better day’ or ‘a better May’ is better than Warburton’s alteration, because it implies that sunshine prevails over rain, whereas Warburton’s ‘wetter May’ implies that Cordelia’s sorrow excelled her patience. Malone adopted Toilet’s emendation, without credit, in the following note; If a better day means either a good day, or the best day, it cannot represent Cordelia’s smiles and tears; for neither the one nor the other necessarily implies rain, without which there is nothing to correspond with her tears; nor can a rainy day, occasionally brightened by sunshine, with any propriety be called a good or the best day. We are compelled, therefore, to make some other change. A better May, on the other hand, whether we understand by it a good May, or a May better than ordinary, corresponds exactly with the preceding image; for in every May, rain may be expected, and in a good, or better May than ordinary, the sunshine, like Cordelia’s smiles, will predominate. Mr Steevens has quoted a passage from Sidney’s Perhaps the following passage in the same book, p. 163, ed. 1593, bears a still nearer resemblance to that before us; ‘And with that she prettily smiled, which mingled with her tears, one could not tell whether it were a mourning pleasure or a delightful sorrow; but like when a few April drops are scattered by a gentle zephyrus among fine-coloured flowers.’ [To the citations which he had previously given] Steevens afterwards added the following: Again in Courtlie Controversie of Cupid's Cautels, &c., translated from the French, &c. by H. W. [Henry Wotton], 1578, p. 289: ‘Who hath viewed in the spring time, raine and sunnc’shine in one moment, might be holde the troubled countenance of the gentlewoman, after she had read and over-read the letters of her Floradin with an eye now smyling, then bathed in teares.’ Singer, in his first edition, gives a note, with which he ‘had been favoured by Mr Boaden’: ‘“Her smiles and tears Were like; a better way.” That is, Cordelia’s smiles and tears were like the conjunction of sunshine and rain, in a better way or manner. Now, in what did this better way consist? Why, simply in the smiles seeming unconscious of the tears; whereas the sunshine has a watery look through the failing drops of rain—“Those happy smiles ... seem’d not to know What guests were in her eyes.” The passages cited by Steevens and Malone prove that the point of comparison was neither a “better day” nor a “wetter May.” I may just observe,"

The comparative is used by Milton and others, instead of the positive and superlative, as well as by Sh. himself in the play before us: ‘The safer sense,’ &c. IV, vi, 81; ‘better part of man,’ Mach, V, viii, 18. The thought is taken from Sidney’s Arcadia, p. 244: ‘Her tears came dropping down like rain in sunshine.’ - Cordelia’s behaviour is apparently copied from Philoclea’s. The same book, in another place, says: ‘her tears followed one another like a precious rope of pearl.’ In this same edition of Steevens in 1778 a note is given by Tollet in which he suggests that ‘a better day’ or ‘a better May’ is better than Warburton’s alteration, because it implies that sunshine prevails over rain, whereas Warburton’s ‘wetter May’ implies that Cordelia’s sorrow excelled her patience. Malone adopted Toilet’s emendation, without credit, in the following note; If a better day means either a good day, or the best day, it cannot represent Cordelia’s smiles and tears; for neither the one nor the other necessarily implies rain, without which there is nothing to correspond with her tears; nor can a rainy day, occasionally brightened by sunshine, with any propriety be called a good or the best day. We are compelled, therefore, to make some other change. A better May, on the other hand, whether we understand by it a good May, or a May better than ordinary, corresponds exactly with the preceding image; for in every May, rain may be expected, and in a good, or better May than ordinary, the sunshine, like Cordelia’s smiles, will predominate. Mr Steevens has quoted a passage from Sidney’s Perhaps the following passage in the same book, p. 163, ed. 1593, bears a still nearer resemblance to that before us; ‘And with that she prettily smiled, which mingled with her tears, one could not tell whether it were a mourning pleasure or a delightful sorrow; but like when a few April drops are scattered by a gentle zephyrus among fine-coloured flowers.’ [To the citations which he had previously given] Steevens afterwards added the following: Again in Courtlie Controversie of Cupid's Cautels, &c., translated from the French, &c. by H. W. [Henry Wotton], 1578, p. 289: ‘Who hath viewed in the spring time, raine and sunnc’shine in one moment, might be holde the troubled countenance of the gentlewoman, after she had read and over-read the letters of her Floradin with an eye now smyling, then bathed in teares.’ Singer, in his first edition, gives a note, with which he ‘had been favoured by Mr Boaden’: ‘“Her smiles and tears Were like; a better way.” That is, Cordelia’s smiles and tears were like the conjunction of sunshine and rain, in a better way or manner. Now, in what did this better way consist? Why, simply in the smiles seeming unconscious of the tears; whereas the sunshine has a watery look through the failing drops of rain—“Those happy smiles ... seem’d not to know What guests were in her eyes.” The passages cited by Steevens and Malone prove that the point of comparison was neither a “better day” nor a “wetter May.” I may just observe,",
        "like a better way] Warburton proposed ‘a wetter May, i.e. a spring season wetter than ordinary;’ and Theobald supported the conjecture by citing [19. like a better way,] Shakespeare’s ‘May of youth.’ Much Ado, V, i, 76; ‘sweet May.’ Mich. Hr V, i, 79; ‘rose of May.’ Ham, IV, v, 153; &c. Heath proposed ‘an April day’, because the ‘joint appearance of rain and sunshine’ was more characteristic of that month than of May. In Theobald’s second edition, although Warburton’s change is still retained in the text, yet the phrase is cited in the note as ‘a better day’. This emendation was adopted, without credit, by Steevens in his edition of 1773; in his edition of 1778 he says: A better day is the best day, and the best day is a day most favourable to the productions of the earth.

Hudson [adopting White’s text]: I cannot say that the reading here given altogether satisfies me; but it seems, on the whole, the best both in sense and in language. The meaning of ‘clamour-moisten’d’ is, her voice being smothered with weeping, or her crying drenched with tears.

The meaning of ‘clamour-moisten’d’ is, her voice being smothered with weeping, or her crying drenched with tears. Walker (Crit. i, 157): Write ‘— her heavenly eyes, And clamour- moisten’d.’ (luctu madentes.) ‘Clamour’ here signifies wailing. Compare V, iii, 205. [Cited by White.] Delius: ‘Moisten’d’ is here used intransitively: clamour became moist. Schmidt (Lex.) gives examples of ‘clamour’ bearing the following meanings: outcry, vociferation; loud wailing (the present passage cited); the sound of bells; of cannon; of the thunder; of trumpets and drums; of tempests; of the noise of a chase, a battle, &c. Wright: The objection to Walker’s interpretation is, that ‘clamour’ is the outcry, and not the tears by which it was accompanied, but perhaps the clamour is the indirect cause of the tears. [Assuredly.—Ed.] For the construction, compare Hen. V: II, ii, 139: ‘the full fraught man and best endued.’ There is probably some corruption. Moberly: Shed tears upon her cry of sorrow, [Of this corrupt phrase in this corrupt scene (perhaps the most corrupt throughout Shakespeare’s plays), I can see but two noteworthy explanations: Capell’s, viz: she moisten’d her clamour; and Walker’s, viz: her eyes that were heavenly and wet with wailing. Of the two I much prefer the latter.—Ed.]"

Between the preceding scene and this present one, he inserts Scene V, calling it Scene III. Wherefore our Scenes III and IV are his Scenes IV and V. The object of this change is to bring closer together all those scenes which represent the transactions in the neighborhood of Dover, and to render unnecessary the supposition that Lear passes a night in the open fields. Eccles says: The distance probably imagined between the place where Regan has that conference with the Steward, which makes the subject of the Scene now before us [Eccles's Scene III, our Scene V], and the vicinity of Dover, seems to be such as requires the notion of a night intervening before he arrives at the latter, and, consequently, the same space of time must elapse between any scene which precedes that just mentioned and any other wherein he appears to have arrived near Dover, as he does in the sixth scene. It follows, then, that between the fourth and sixth, as hitherto numbered, a night must pass; but the solicitude to find the King, expressed by Cordelia in the former of these, makes it probable that her efforts were attended with success before the coming on of night. Let, therefore, scene the fifth of the ancient distribution stand as the third in this place, and suppose it to pass on the evening of the third day since that, inclusively taken, on the morning of which Lear, attended by certain of his knights, began to be conveyed from the castle of Gloucester on his route towards Dover, and that, in some former part of the same, Edmund had departed from Regan upon the business which she here mentions as the motive of his expedition. ... It appears that the Steward, not finding Edmund as he expected, sets out towards Dover without loss of time in pursuit of him, I suppose the troops of Albany to have begun their march towards Dover, but in another direction, about the time of the Steward’s departure from home charged with the execution of Goneril’s commission. That might be either some part of the same day on which she had reached her own habitation accompanied by Edmund, or the morning of the succeeding one, so as to allow time for the Steward to arrive at his destination in the evening, as there is some reason for supposing he had done by Regan’s exhortation in this scene [our Scene V] to wait the safe conduct of her forces on the morrow, and her hint respecting the insecurity of travelling. [See Appendix: The Duration of the Action p.409.] When Eccles comes to this present scene, which he calls Scene IV, he says: Let the period of this scene be supposed the fourth morning from that (both, however, inclusively) whereon Lear, with Kent and the rest of his attendants, began his progress from Gloucester’s castle, Goneril and Edmund from the same set out for the palace of Albany, and, later in the day, the sightless Gloucester, conducted by the Old Man, began to go to Dover. The Gentleman who enters, conversing with Kent, is the same who was deputed by him as a messenger to Dover on the night of the storm. From their conversation we infer that this meeting has but a very little while before taken place. Kent appears to be but newly arrived.

Thus Lear’s crown is admirably descriptive or emblematic of the sources and variety of the disease under which he labours. The mixture of such flowers and plants could not be the effect of chance.’ He justifies his assertion by showing that ‘the leaves of “Fumitory” are of a bitter taste, and the juice was formerly employed for its bitterness in hypochondrisra and black jaundice by Hoffman and others.’ ‘Harlock, the wild mustard of our cornfields, is called indifferently charlock, garlock, warlock, and by Fitzherbert, and other old English writers, hedlock. The seeds of this plant form the pungent Durham mustard, as those of Sinapis alba form the white mustard, and those of Sinapis nigra the common mustard. The plant rises with a stem of about nine inches, thickly set with hairs or bristles. Hence the proper name should be probably “har-lock,” as in Danish they call the darnell “keyre” and “heyre-grass.” As the bitter pungency is referred to in the former case, the biting pungency is referred to here. “Hemlock” is generally known to be poisonous. “Nettles,” called Urtica urens from its well-known irritating power of stinging and burning. “Cuckoo-flowers.” Cardamine pratensis, Linn.

        "Ellacombe (p. 75): Of Fumitories we have five species in England, all of them weeds in cultivated grounds and in hedge-rows. None of them can be considered garden plants, but they are closely allied to the Corydalis, of which there are several pretty species, and to the very handsome Dicentra, of which one species, spectabilis, ranks among the very handsomest of our hardy herbaceous plants. How the plant acquired its name of Fumitory, earth-smoke, is not very satisfactorily explained, though many explanations have been given; but that the name was an ancient one, we know from the interesting Stockholm manuscript of the eleventh century published by Mr J. Pettigrew, and of which a few lines are worth quoting : “Fumiter is erbe, I say, Yt springyth i April et in May. In feld, in town, in yard, et gate, Yer lond is fat and good in state, Dun red is his flour Ye erbe smek lik in cofowur.”"

        "Wright: I find “hardbake” is given as the equivalent of yacea nigra (or knapweed) in a MS herbal in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge (R. 14, 32); and in John Russell’s Boke of Nurture (Early English Text Society, 1868), p. 183, is mentioned “yardehok,” which is apparently a kind of hock or mallow. If the botanists could identify the plants mentioned under these names, either of them could easily be corrupted into “Hardokes,” or “hor-docks.” [It is unfortunate that both Beisly and Ellacombe suppose Farmer’s conjecture of karlocks to be the original word; they have, therefore, given us nothing new on the subject, and do not mention “burdocks.”—Ed.]",
        "Ellacombe (91): hemlock] One of the most poisonous of a suspicious family (the Umbenliferae), “the great Hemlocke doubtlesse is not possessed of any one good facultie, as appeareth by his lothsome smell and other apparent signes,” and with this evil character the Hemlocke was considered to be only fit for the ingredient of witches’ broth—“I have been plucking, plants among, Hemlock, henbane, adder’s-tongue, Night-shade, moonwort, lippard’s-bane.”—Jonson [The Masque of Queens]. Yet the Hemlock adds largely to the beauty of our hedge-rows; its spotted tall stems and its finely cut leaves make it a handsome weed, and the dead stems and dried umbels are marked features in the winter appearance of the hedges. As a poison it has an evil notoriety, as being the poison by which Socrates was put to death, though this is not quite certain. It is not, however, altogether a useless plant. It is a valuable medicinal plant, and in autumn the ripened stem is cut into pieces to make reels for worsted thread.",
        "Johnstone: nettles] The Nettle needs no introduction; we are all too well acquainted with it, yet it is not altogether a weed 'to be despised. We have two native species (Urtica urens and U. dioica), with sufficiently strong qualities, but we have a third (U. pilulifera), very curious in its manner of bearing its female flowers in clusters of compact little balls, which is far more virulent than either of our native species, and is said by Camden to have been introduced by the Romans to chafe their bodies when frozen by the cold of Britain. The story is probably apocryphal, but the plant is an alien, and only grows in a few places. Both the Latin and English names of the plant record its qualities. Urtica is from uro, to burn; and Nettle is etymologically the same word as needle, and the plant is so named, not for its stinging qualities, but because at one time the Nettle supplied the chief instrument of sewing; not the instrument which holds the thread, and to which we now confine the word needle, but the thread itself, and very good linen it made. The poet Campbell says in one of his letters: “I have slept in Nettle sheets, and dined off a Nettle table-cloth, and I have heard my mother say that she thought Nettle cloth more durable than any other linen.” It has also been used for making paper, and, for both these purposes, as well as for rope-making, the Rhea fibre of the Himalaya, which is simply a gigantic Nettle (Urtica or Boehmeria nivea), is very largely cultivated. Nor is the Nettle to be despised as an article of food. In many parts of England the young shoots are boiled and much relished. In February, 1661, Pepys made the entry in his diary: “We did eat some Nettle porridge which was made on purpose to-day for some of their coming, and was very good.” Gipsies are said to cook it as an excellent vegetable, and M. Soyer tried hard, but almost in vain, to recommend it as a most dainty dish. Having so many uses, we are not surprised to find that it has at times been regularly cultivated as a garden crop, so that I have somewhere seen an account of tithe of Nettles being taken, and in the old church-wardens’ account of St. Michael’s, Bath, is the entry in the year 1400: “Pro urticis venditis ad Lawrencium Bebbe, 2d.” In other points the Nettle is a most interesting plant. Microscopists find in it most beautiful objects for the microscope; entomologists value it, for it is such a favourite of butterflies and other insects that in Britain alone upwards of thirty insects feed solely on the Nettle plant, and it is one of those curious plants which mark the progress of civilization by following man wherever he goes. But as a garden-plant the only advice to be given is to keep it out of the garden by every means. In good cultivated ground it becomes a sad weed if once allowed a settlement. The Himalayan Boehmerias, however, are handsome, but only for their foliage, and though we cannot, perhaps, admit our roadside Dead Nettles, which, however, are much handsomer than many foreign flowers which we carefully tend and prize, yet the Austrian Dead Nettle (Lamium orvala, Bot. Mag. v, 172) may be well admitted as a handsome garden-plant.",

        "Ellacombe: Darnel] Virgil, in his Fifth Eclogue, says: “Grandia saepe quibus mandavimus hordea sulcis Infelix lolium et steriles nascuntur avenae.” Thus translated by Thomas Newton, 1587: “Sometimes there sproutes abundant store Of baggage, noisome weeds, Burres, Brembles, Darnel, Cockle, Dawke, Wild Oates, and choaking seedes.” And the same is repeated in the first Georgic, and in both places lolium is always translated Darnel, and so by common consent Darnel is identified with the Lolium temulentum, or wild rye grass. But in Shakespeare’s time Darnel, like Cockle, was the general name for any hurtful weed. In the old translation of the Bible, the Zizania, which is now translated Tares, was sometimes translated Cockle, and Newton, writing in Shakespeare’s time, says: “Under the name of Cockle and Darnel is comprehended all vicious, noisom and unprofitable graine, encumbriiig and hindring good come.” Herball to the Bible. The Darnel is not only injurious from choking the corn, but its seeds become mixed with the true Wheat, and so in Dorsetshire, and perhaps in other parts, it has the name of “Cheat” (Barnes’s Glossary), from its false likeness to Wheat. It was this false likeness that got for it its bad character. “Darnell, or Jurey,” says Lyte, Herbal, 1578, “Is a vitious graine that combereth or anoyeth come, especially Wheat, and in his knotten straw, blades, or leaves is like unto Wheate.”",

Zealous, honourable, even self-sacrificing fidelity,—sometimes to a chief or leader, sometimes to a party, a faction, or a gang,—appears to be so little dependent on any principle of virtuous duty, that it is often found strongest among those who have thrown off the common restraints of morality. It would seem that when man’s obligations to his God or his kind are rejected or forgotten, the most abandoned mind still craves something for the exercise of its natural social sympathies, and as it loses sight of nobler and truer duties becomes, like the Steward, more and more \"duteous\" to the vices of its self-chosen masters. This is one of the moral phenomena of artificial society, so much within the range of Johnson’s observation, as an acute observer of life, that it is strange that he should not have recognized its truth in Oswald’s character."

        "Johnson: How fearful, &c.] This description has been much admired since the time of Addison, who has remarked, with a poor attempt at pleasantry, that ‘he who can read it without being giddy has a very good head, or a very bad one.’ The description is certainly not mean, but I am far from thinking it wrought to the utmost excellence of poetry. He that looks from a precipice finds himself assailed by one great and dreadful image of irresistible destruction. But this overwhelming idea is dissipated and enfeebled from the instant that the mind can restore itself to the observation of particulars, and diffuse its attention to distinct objects. The enumeration of the choughs and crows, the samphire-man and the fishers, counteracts the great effect of the prospect, as it peoples the desert of intermediate vacuity, and stops the mind in the rapidity of its descent through emptiness and horror.",
        "Mason: How fearful, &c.] It is to be considered that Edgar is describing an imaginary precipice, and is not therefore supposed to be so strongly impressed with the dreadful prospect of inevitable destruction as a person would be who really found himself on the brink of one.",
        "Eccles: How fearful, &c.] The purpose of Edgar was, by a minute and faithful detail of such circumstances, to give the highest possible air of probability to the imposition which he designed to practise on his father.",
        "Knight: How fearful, &c.] In Dr Johnson’s criticism we detect much of the peculiar character of his mind, as well as of the poetical taste of the age in which he lived. Wordsworth, in the preface to the second edition of his Poems, has shown clearly upon what false foundations that criticism is built which would prefer high-sounding words, conveying only indeterminate ideas, and call these the only proper language of poetry, in opposition ' to the simple and distinct language, ‘however naturally arranged^ and according to the strict laws of metre,* which by such criticism is denominated prosaic. Johnson was thoroughly consistent in his dislike of the ‘ observation of particulars* and the * attention to distinct objects.* In BoswelFs L^e we have a more detailed account of his poetical creed, with reference to this very description of Dover Cliff; ‘Johnson smd that the description of the temple, in [xi. Dover Cliff,] The Mournmg Bride, was the finest poetical passage he had ever read; he recol- lected none in Sh, equal to it, How reverend is the face of this tall pile, Whose ancient pillars rear.their marble heads, To bear aloft its arch'd and pond'rous roof; By its own weight made steadfast and immoveable. Looking tranquillity ! It strikes an awe And terror on my aching sight. The tombs And monumental caves of death look cold. And shoot a chilliness to my trembling heart 1\" But,” said Garrick, all alarmed for the god of his idolatry, we know not the extent and variety of his powers. We are to suppose there are such passages in his works ; Sh. must not suffer for the badness of our memories.” Johnson, diverted by this enthusiastic jealousy, went on with great ardour—“ No, sir; Congreve has nature'^ (smiling on the tragic eagerness of Garrick); but, composing himself, he added. Sir, this is not comparing Congreve on the whole with Sh. on the whole, but only maintaining that Congreve has one finer passage than any that can be found in Sh. . . . What I mean is, that you can show me no passage where there is simply a description of material objects, without any intermixture of moral notions, which produces such an effect.” Mr Murphy mentioned Shakespeare’s description of the night before the battle of Agin court; but it was observed it had men in it, Mr Davies suggested the speech of Juliet, in which she figures herself awaking in the tomb of her ancestors. Some one mentioned the description of Dover Cliff. Johnson—<‘No, sir; it should be all precipice,—all vacuum. The crows impede your fall. The diminished appearance of the boats, and other circumstances, are all very 'good description, but do not impress the mind at once with the horrible idea of immense height. The impression is divided; you pass on, by computation, from one stage of the tremendous space to another. Had the girl in 'The Afaurning Bride Said she could not cast her shoe to the top of one of the pillars in the temple, it would not have aided the idea, but weakened it.” ’ Taken as pieces of pure description, there is only one way of testing the different value of the passages in Sh. and Congreve—that is, by considering what ideas the mind receives from the different modes adopted to convey ideas. But the criticism of Johnson, even if it could have established that the passage of Congreve, taken apart, was * finer’ than that of Sh., utterly overlooks the dratnatic propriety of each passage. The ‘ girl ’ in The Mourn^ ing Bride is soliloquizing,—uttering a piece of versification, haimonious enough, indeed, but without any dramatic purpose. The mode in which Edgar describes the cliff is for the special information of the blind Gloucester,—one who could not look from a precipice. The crows and choughs, the samphire-gatherer, the fisherman, the bark, the surge that is seen but not heard,—each of these, incidental to the place, is selected as a standard by which Gloucester can. measure the altitude of the cliff. Transpose the description into the generalities of Congreve’s • description of the cathedral, and the dramatic propriety at least is utterly destroyed. The height o£ the cliff is then only presented as ah image to Gloucester’s mind upon the vague assertion of his conductor. Let the description begin, for example, something after the fashion of Congreve: < How fearful is the edge of this high cliff I’ and Continue with a proper assortment of chalky crags and gulfs below. Of what worth then would be Edgar's concluding lines; *I’ll look no more/ &c,? The mind of Gloucester might have thus received some ‘idea of immense height/ but not an idea that he could appreciate ‘ by computation.’ The very defects which Johnson imputes to Shakespeare’s description constitute its dramatic merit. We have no hesitation in saying further, that they constitute its surpassing poetical beauty, apart from its dramatic propriety. [Knight quotes a correspondent’s assertion that the height of the Ciif? Is 313 feet above high-water mark.] Lessing, in the Supplement to his Laoedon, compares this description of Dover Cliff with Milton’s description of the height whence the King of Glory beholds Chaos: ‘On heavenly ground they stood, and from the shore They view’d the vast immeasurable abyss Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild, Up from the bottom turn’d by furious winds And surging waves, as mountains, to assault Heaven’s highth,and with the centre mix the pole.’— dise Losi, vii, 210, « This depth,’ says Lessing, ‘is far greater than Dover Cliff, and yet the description of it produces no effect, because there is nothing visible to make it real to us, whereas in Sh, this is so admirably managed by the gradual lessening of the various objects/"

Such a spot is a bourn because it is a boundary, a natural division ; and this is the sense in which a river is called a * bourn,’ The * chalky bourn ’ is, in the same way, the chalky boundary of England towards France."

        "Hunter: strangeness] (ii, 273): The incident of the cliff is so extravagantly improbable that there is no defending it, and we tolerate it only as having given oc- casion to Shakespeare’s only great attempt at describing a particular piece of scenery. He had probably been at Dover, and sketched the scene upon the place. He evi- dently prepares the reader for the passage by several allusions to Dover in the earlier parts of the play, and, except for the sake of introducing these descriptive lines, one cannot see why Gloucester should be led so far as Dover, when he might so easily have executed his purpose elsewhere. There is an obscurity thrown (purposely, I think) over the topography of this play. Dr Johnson says, that this scene and the stratagem are wholly borrowed from Sidney’s Arcadia; but this is a mistake. It is true we have a blind king, who seeks the brow of a rock with the intention of throw- ing himself headlong. He asks his son to conduct him thither. So far the stories are coincident, but the improbable part is not yet entered upon; and, so far from Sh, liaving here followed Sidney, or having any countenance from a more cautious writer of fiction, the son in the Arcadia even refuses to conduct his father to the spot. Sh., as far as our knowledge at present goes, must be answerable in his own proper per- son, and alone, for what is too improbable to give as an incident any degree of plea- sure. At the same time, he may have owed the conception of that particular mode of suicide to Sidney, since the passage occurs in that part of the Arcadia to which, he owed, according to Steevens, the episodical incidents of Gloucester, Edmund, and Edgar. But there actually occurred in Shakespeare’s time the incident of a London merchant committing suicide by throwing himself headlong from the tower of one of the churches. [I cannot think that Hunter is at his happiest in this note. His Jliuitrations generally are among the best that have been written.—Ed.]"

        "feelingly] Moberly: In an inward and heartfelt way. Lear takes the word to mean “only by feeling as I have no eyes.” ‘What do you want with eyes;’ he rejoins, ‘to know how the world goes?’ 169, handy-dandy] Malone: This is a play among children, in which something is shaken between the hands, and then a guess is made in which hand it is retained. See Florio: ‘Bazzicchiare, To shake betweene two hands, to play handy-dandy.’ Coles (Latin Dict., 1679) renders ‘to play handy-dandy,’ by digitis micare; and he is followed by Ainsworth; but they appear to have been mistaken, as is Dr Johnson in his definition, in his Dictionary, which seems to have been formed on the passage before us, misunderstood. He says, Handy-dandy is ‘a play in which children change hands and places.’ Douse: This explanation is confirmed by the following extract from A free discourse touching the murmurers of the tymes, MS: ‘They ... play with your majestic as men play with little children at handye dandye, which hand will you have, when they are disposed to keep any thinge from them.’ Halliwell says this is one of the oldest games In existence, not only alluded to by Piers Plowman, but, according to Pope in his Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus, by Plato. “Sometimes” the game is played by a sort of sleight of hand, changing the article rapidly from one hand to another. ... This is what Sh. alludes to by changing places.’ 160, lusts] This is an instance cited by Walker (Crit. ii, 125) of the substitution in the Folio of s for st in the second person singular of the verb. ‘Queere, asks Walker, ‘in cases where st would produce extreme harshness, and where at the same time the old copies have s, whether we ought not to write the latter. (In the north of England, and in Scotland (see, for example, Burns, passim), s for st in the second person seems to be the rule.)’ [To return to the usage of the Qq Ff in this instance is hardly more violent than to adopt it in place of its. Can harshness farther go than in “hotly lust’st to”? I regret that I did not soften a line correspondingly harsh in modern editions, and print in Ham, I, ii, 53 “Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon.”—Ed.]"

      "notes": [
        "block] Johnson would read ‘a good flock’ that is, a flock of wool. Lear picks up a flock, and immediately thinks to surprise his enemies by a troop of horse shod with flocks or felt. Yet “block” may stand, if we suppose that the sight of a block put him in mind of mounting his horse. Capell: The mode of Lear’s madness is chang’d; it is calm, and shews some sparks of reason; he knows Gloucester, and his condition; tells him he must be patient; ... says he will “preach\" to him; upon this he puts himself in posture of one who would preach, and pulls off his hat; Scarce has he utter'd a few words when some fumes of a wilder nature fly up; the hat catches his eye, and sets fire to another train of ideas; the words “This a good block?” are spoke looking upon the hat; and this is follow’d by a second conceit, which has its rise from the same circumstance, about “felt,” and the use it might be put to. Steevens: “Block” anciently signified the head part of the hat, or the thing on which a hat is formed, and sometimes the hat itself. Thus Much Ado, I, i, 75: “He wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat: it ever changes with the next block.” Again, in Beau. and Fl. Wit at Several Weapons [IV, i]: “I am so haunted with this broad brim’d hat Of the last progress block, with the young hatband.” Again, in The Two Merry Milkmaids 1620: “—my haberdasher has a new block and will find me and all my generation in beavers, &c.” Again, in Decker’s Gull’s Hornbook, 1609: “—that cannot observe the time of his hatband, nor know what fashioned block is most kin to his head; for in my opinion, the braine that cannot chuse his felt well,” &c. Again, in The Seven Deadly Sinnes of London, by Decker, 1606: “—The blocke for his. head alters faster than the felt-maker can fit him.” To the same effect Rushton (Euphuism, p. 52) cites instances from Lily’s Euphuës. Collier: “Block” implies that Lear is referring to the shape of his hat, when he probably had none upon his head, being, as we are told, “fantastically dressed with straw and wild flowers.” Few things can be clearer than that “block” was misheard for plot as it stands in the (MS), and that the “good plot” was to shoe, &c. [Capell’s explanation is, to me, scarcely satisfactory, although it is adopted by every editor but Collier, and is amply supported, as far as the peculiar use of the word ‘block’ is concerned, by Steevens’s and Rushton’s citations. The image of that distraught head covered by a felt hat is not pleasing, to say the least. I can offer nothing better, unless it be that “block” is used in its ordinary sense, and that Lear mounts one to deliver his preachment from. Since writing this I have found the following in Tieck (iii, 241): “Brockmann at these words mounted the stump of a tree.” For this Tieck finds fault with him; “the action was neither necessary nor did it impart any beauty to the passage. Schroder afterwards, on the same stage in Vienna, represented himself so weak and worn out that he could not raise his trembling foot high enough to mount upon the stump; this he did apparently to show that his predecessor had acted what was not true to nature.” Tieck adds, that “Schroder, with his keen intelligence, would probably confess in cooler moments that he was even more sophistical than Brockmann; an old man who was as weak as this could certainly not have stormed about the open fields, and made his pursuers run hard to catch him.” In Edwin Booth’s Prompt Book there is here the stage-direction: “Lear takes Curan’s hat.” This is certainly better than to suppose that he took his own.—Ed.]"

Yet, at the same time, there are the gay irrationality and the incoherency that mark this stage of mania."

I have, therefore, printed “bin” and “whither,” which may be, in reality, indications of the pronunciation. Ed.] Ellis (E. E. Pronunciation p. 293): The contractions cham, chas, chit (tsham, tshas, tshil) for ich am, ich was, ich will, are mentioned by Gill (Logonomia, p. 17) as a Southern pronunciation, in Rev. W. Barnes’s edition of the Glossary of the Dialect of Forth and Bargy, and in the Glossary to his Poems in the Dorset dialect, 1858, p. 150. The dialectic pronunciations Ise, Ice are preserved [here in Lear]. About thirty years ago titchy was in use for I in the eastern border of Devonshire and in Dorset, and examples of cham, chould = I am, I would, occur in the Exmoor Scoldings which dates from the beginning of the last century. Wright: I will, contracted from “ich will,” just as “chud” is for “ich would” or “ich should.” In Grose’s Provincial Glossary “chell” is said to be used for “I shall” in Somerset and Devon, and “cham” for “I am” in Somerset, In Whetstone’s Promos and Cassandra we find “cham,” “chy,” “chaue,” “chul,”"

      "notes": [
        "space] Theobald in his correspondence with Warburton (Nichols’s Illus. ii, 382), asks: “Does [‘space’] mean, What a scope more than we can discover, do women give themselves in pursuits of vice!” This conjecture was not repeated in his edition. Singer (Sh. Vindicated, &c. p. 275) suggests “‘undisguised scope of woman’s will.” If we adopt wit of the Qq, we might read undisguised scape of woman’s wit.”’ Whereupon Dyce (ed. i) remarks: “Mr Singer offers a brace of conjectures, which I must take the liberty of saying he ought to have suppressed.” The “brace” failed to appear in Singer’s subsequent edition. Voss conjectures pace, that is, “How trifling, insignificant, is the step between a woman’s different wills!” Bailey (i, 110) thinks “we have only to reflect on what a man in Edgar’s position would be likely to say in order to arrive at the right reading.” This simple process leads Bailey to the belief that maze is the true word here. 269, Theobald: The reading [of the Ff: “will,” instead of wit of the Qq] gives us, as Mr Warburton observes to me, a most elegant Expression and most satirical Thought; more delicate than the “varium et mutabile semper femina” of Virgil. ’Tis not the Extravagance, but the Mutability, of a Woman’s Will that is here satiriz’d. The Change of which (our Author would be understood to say,) is so speedy, that there is no Space of time, no Distance, between the present Will and the next; but it is an undistinguish’d Space. This Sentiment may not be ill explain’d further from what honest Sancho, in Don Quixote, with infinite Humour says upon the subject. Entre el Si y el No de la muger, no me atreveria yo d poner una punta d’ Alfiler. Betwixt a Woman’s Yea, and No, I would not undertake to thrust a Pin’s Point. Davies: A vicious woman sets no bounds to her appetites. Steevens: 0 undistinguishing licentiousness of a woman’s inclinations! Collier: Here, according to the (MS), we have a remarkable proof of mishearing. ... The fact is that “undistinguish’d” ought to be unextinguished, and “space” blaze; thus taking “will” for disposition, the clear intention of the poet is to make Edgar exclaim against the unextinguishable fire or blaze of the appetite of woman, as illustrated by the letter and conduct of Goneril. Dyce: “Undistinguish’d space” means space whose limits are not to be distinguished. White: That is, 0, unmarked, boundless reach of woman’s will! Hudson: “Undistinguish’d” for undistinguishable, like “unnumbered” for innumerable. Woman’s will has no distinguishable bounds or no assignable limits; there is no telling what she will do or where she will stop. Staunton: Whatever may have been the original lection, it was plainly an exclamation against the indiscriminate caprice of woman as exhibited by Goneril in plotting against a virtuous husband’s life merely to gain a villain like Edmund. We should perhaps read: “undistinguishable sense of woman’s will.” Wright: So wide-reaching [is a woman’s will] that its workings cannot be discovered. ... Without calling in question the absolute truth of Sancho’s profound observation [as quoted by Theobald], it is at least allowable to doubt the propriety of applying it in the present case. Edgar’s astonishment is not at the fickleness and caprice of Goneril, but at the enormous wickedness of the plot which her letter revealed. Moberly: The passage may be a reminiscence of Horace’s: “Cum fas atque nefas exiguo fine libidinum Discernunt avidi” (Odes, I, xviii), which Mr Wickham renders: “While in their greedy haste they divide right and wrong by the slender line of their own appetite;” i.e. “when the only distinction which they place between right and wrong is, that they desire the thing or not.” So here Shakespeare’s idea seems to be that a woman’s will knows no limits between good and evil.” Schmidt: That is, “Oh undistinguishable range of the female appetite!” Edgar is astonished that a woman can be found to prefer Edmund to the noble Albany."

A suspicion of this may have crossed Shakespeare’s mind, for he represents Lear in imminent danger of passing into a new form of delusion. The earliest note of the employment of music in the treatment of the insane is in the Bible (1 Sam. xvi) where David calmed Saul. ... Modern physicians appear to have little faith in its effects when simply listened to. Esquirol says, “I have often employed music, but very rarely obtained any success thereby. It calms and composes the mind, but does not cure. I have seen insane persons whom music rendered furious; ... I believe the ancients exaggerated the effects of music, while the facts recorded by modern writers are not sufficiently numerous to determine under what circumstances it possibly may be of benefit. This means of treatment, however, is precious, especially in convalescence, and ought not to be neglected, however indeterminate may be the principles of its application, and however uncertain may be its efficacy.”’"

        "be-met] Abbott, § 438: In participles, be-, like other prefixes, is often redundant, and seems to indicate an unconscious want of some substitute for the old participial prefix. Wright: The prefix here has apparently no force whatever. Schmidt: Only found here, and perhaps coined by Sh. 28-31. for ... oppose] Theobald (followed by Warburton and Johnson) represents this speech as broken off by Edmund’s interruption, and therefore has merely a comma and a dash after \"oppose.\" He also supposes that \"for\" is a contraction of before, and prints it fore, and thus paraphrases the whole sentence: \"Before We fight this Battle, Sir, it concerns me, (tho’ not the King, and the discontented Party;) to question about your Interest in our Sister, and the Event of the War.\" He adds: \"And Regan and Gonerill, in their Replies, both seem apprehensive that this Subject was coming into Debate.\" Warburton pronounces it \"a very plain speech,\" and gives the meaning thus: This quarrel is just in one sense and unjust in another. As France invades our land, I am concerned to repel him, but as he holds, entertains and supports the king, and others whom I fear many just and heavy causes make, or compel, as it were, to oppose us, I esteem it unjust to engage against them. Capell thus paraphrases: \"As for this business,—it toucheth us as France invades our kingdom, not as he holds for the king, in conjunction with the others whom,\" &c. Steevens: This business touches us as France invades our land, not as it \"bolds the king,\" i.e. emboldens him to assert his former title. Thus in the ancient interlude of Hycke Scomer: \"Alas, that I had not one to hold me!\" Again, in Hall’s trans. of the Fourth Iliad, 1581: \"And Pallas bolds the Greeks,\" &c. [As Wright observes, Steevens is wrong here; it is not \"this business\" that \"bolds the king,\" but \"France,\" as Warburton and Capell have justly interpreted it. For a long list of verbs like \"bolds\" formed from nouns and adjectives, see Abbott, § 290.—Ed.] Cambridge Editors: \"Not bolds the king\" is usually interpreted as an elliptical phrase for \"Not as it emboldens the king.\" This is, however, a very harsh construction, and the word \"bolds\" occurs nowhere else in Sh. with this meaning, though we have, according to the most probable reading, \"dear'd\" for \"endear'd\" in Ant. & Cleop. I, iv, 44. Possibly these words are corrupt and a line has dropped out before them. Albany ought to say something of this kind: \"I should be ready to resist any mere invader, but the presence in the invader’s camp of the king and other Britons, who have a just cause of enmity to us, dashes my courage.\""

        "side] Mason: \"I shall scarcely be able to make out my game.\" The allusion is to a party at cards, and he is afraid that he shall not be able to make his side successful.

At this downright game, I may but hold your cards, I’ll not pull down the side.\" Again, in the The Maid's Tragedy [II, i]: \"Evad. Aspatia take her part. Tula, I will refuse it; she will pluck down a side; she does not use it.\" But the phrase is still more clearly explained in Massinger’s Great Duke of Florence [IV, ii]: \"If I hold your cards, I shall pull down the side; I am not good at the game.\" Gifford, in a note on the passage in The Unnatural Combat, says: The allusion is to a party at cards; to set up a side was to become partners in a game; to pull, or pluck down a side (for both these terms are found in our old plays), was to occasion its loss by ignorance or treachery. To this Dyce (Gloss.) adds: \"and to carry out a side was to carry out the game with success.\" White: The phrase should hardly need explanation as long as people take sides in games and in earnest. To Walker (Crit. iii, 283) this phrase, strangely enough, seems to have been unfamiliar; he terms \"side\" nonsense, adding \"suite, I suppose.\" Lettsom, in a foot-note, says: \"If Walker is right, 'carry out' is used almost in the new-fangled sense common of late years. It seems to have nearly the same meaning in the passage quoted by Steevens from The Honest Man's Fortune, IV, ii [Beau. and Fl. p. 424, ed. Dyce], 'thy greatness may ... carry out A world of evils with thy title.'\""

It is the emotional excitability often seen in extreme age, as it is depicted in the early scenes of the drama, and it is precisely true to the probabilities of the mind’s history, that this should be the phase of infirmity displaying itself at this moment. Any other dramatist than Shakespeare would have represented the poor old king quite restored to the balance and control of his faculties. The complete efficiency of filial love would have been made to triumph over the laws of mental function. But Shakespeare has represented the exact degree of improvement which was probable under the circumstances, namely, restoration from the intellectual mania which resulted from the combined influence of physical and moral shock, with persistence of the emotional excitement and disturbance which is the incurable and unalterable result of passion exaggerated by long habitude and by the malign influence of extreme age."

But, I fear, this interpretation is doubtful; it seems to defer the checking of Goneril until after the result of the combat has proved Edmund’s treason; whereas Albany’s object was to unmask his wife on the spot. This passage is the only one cited by Schmidt (Lex.) under the head of \"conviction, impeachment;\" there is, therefore, presumably no parallel instance, to guide us, of its use in this sense. The chiefest objection that would be urged, to \"arrest\" of the Ff, is, I suppose, its presence in the preceding line. But the argument is wearisome that Shakespeare never could have used the same word twice within the compass of a few lines. If it be true, Shakespeare is unlike any writer that ever lived in the tide of time (which in one sense is true, but not in the sense here meant). In arresting Edmund, Albany arrests Goneril, not \"on capital treason,\" but in her matrimonial plans. Even without the authority of the Ff, \"arrest\" seems preferable to attaint. Since writing this, Schmidt’s edition has reached me, and in it he says, \"Shakespeare does not use the noun attaint in the sense of accusation, and the verb in his plays is equivalent to convict of high treason, not to accuse of it. There can be no reference to a conviction in the present passage.\"—Ed.]"

For if one who was no knight accused another who was, that other was under no obligation to accept the challenge. On this account it was necessary, as Edgar came disguised, to tell the Bastard he was a knight. Johnson: The \"privilege of this 'oath'\" means the privilege gained by taking the oath administered in the regular initiation of a knight professed. Malone’s interpretation seems the best: Edgar says: \"Here! draw my sword. Behold it is the privilege or right of my profession to draw it against a traitor. I protest, therefore,\" &c. It is not the charge itself (as Warburton has erroneously stated), but the right of bringing the charge and maintaining it with his sword, which Edgar calls the privilege of his profession. Moberly: The words which begin the line seem corrupt. Perhaps the true reading may be, \"I hold it as the privilege of mine honour, My oath, and my profession;\" that is, \"I hold here my sword, to which I am entitled by honourable birth, as well as by my oath and profession of knighthood.\""

        "Hold, sir;] Capell: Albany sees Edgar’s resentments carrying him to a present dispatch; which it behov’d him to hinder, as well for punishing Edmund with a death of more infamy as for getting out of him by torture or otherwise the whole iniquitous business in which he had been actor. Delius, in his first edition, followed Capell’s interpretation, but in his second he adopted the correct view, pointed out by Dyce, who says: ‘Hold, sir’ is spoken to Edmund, \"Hold\" being formerly a word commonly used when any one presented anything to another. Compare \"Hold, therefore, Angelo,\" &c., Meas. for Meas, I, i, 43; \"Hold, my hand,\" &c., Jul. Cæs., I, iii, 117; \"But, hold thee, take this garland,\" &c., Ib. V, iii, 85. [For many other instances, see Schmidt (Lex, s. v., hold) where, however, this present one from Lear is not cited.] Schmidt, in his edition, compares it to the French, tenez, and adds that \"from the manner in which the letter came into Albany’s hands, Albany could not know whether Edmund was acquainted with its contents or not. Those editors who follow the Qq in line 161 should follow them here, and omit ‘Hold, sir.’\""

The following occur in the present tragedy, as noted by Walker : ‘Place sinnes with Gold…Arme it in ragges,’ IV, vi, 163; ‘To come betwixt our sentences and our power,’ I, i, 169; ‘Since that respect and Roriunss are his love,’ I, I, 247; ‘He sales my Lord, your Daughters is not well,’ I, iv, 49; and machi nation ceases.

        "Capell: promised end?] Capell was the first to point out that \"the horror\" of which this sight was the image, according to Edgar, is— the horror of the last day, or day of judgement, call’d emphatically that Horror. Steevens at first thought that Kent meant to ask : Is this conclusion such as the present turn of affairs seemed to promise? Or is it only, as Edgar replied, a representation of that horror which we suppose to be real? but Steevens afterwards acknowledged the excellence of the following explanation by Mason :",
        "Mason: promised end?] By the \"promised end\" Kent does not mean that conclusion which the state of their affairs seemed to promise, but the end of the world. In St. Mark's Gospel, when Christ foretells to his disciples the end of the world, and is describing to them the signs that were to precede, and mark the approach of, our final dissolution, he says: \"For in those days shall be affliction such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created, unto this time, neither shall be\"; and afterwards he says, \"Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and the children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.\" Kent, in contemplating the unexampled scene of exquisite affliction which was then before him, and the unnatural attempt of Goneril and Regan against their father’s life, recollects these passages, and asks, whether that was the end of the world that had been foretold to us. To which Edgar adds: \"Or only a representation or resemblance of that horror?\" So Macbeth, when he calls upon Banquo, Malcolm, &c. to view Duncan murdered, says: Up, up, and see The great doom’s image! There is evidently an allusion to the same passage in Scripture in a speech of Gloster’s which he makes, I, ii, 98, &c. If any critic should urge it as an objection to this explanation, that the persons of the drama are pagans, and, of consequence, unacquainted with the Scriptures, they give Sh. credit for more accuracy than I fear he possessed.",
        "Steevens: promised end?] This note deserves the highest praise, and is inserted with the utmost degree of gratitude to its author. [Although Mason’s view, for which a hint may have been supplied by Capell, is probably correct, yet the following note by Henley deserves consideration:]",
        "Henley: promised end?] Does not this exclamation refer to the confidence expressed in her letter to himself, ‘ that—seeking to give losses their remedies—she should find time amidst the enormities of the state, to obtain the full effect of her purpose?’ As these words (supposing this to be their reference in the mouth of Kent) were not addressed to Edgar, there Is no necessity for considering them as understood by him in their proper sense; his resumption, therefore, or rather adaptation of them, may not only admit, but even require, a different interpretation. Mason’s is an ingenious, and may be the true one; for, though the passage of St. Mark, which he cites, does not refer to the ‘end of the world’ (as he might have learned from the 30th verse of the same chapter), but to the destruction of Jerusalem and the Jewish state, yet the prediction itself is vulgarly received in the sense in which he applies it,",
        "Halliwell: promised end?] The reference is to the unexpected catastrophe, so unlooked for just at the moment when everything seemed to promise a happy termination to the innocent and injured parties in the drama."

Of that fall and cease? continues Albany. ‘Fall and cease’ are, therefore, to be considered substantives, and in apposition to ‘that horror.’ In his text Delius puts an interro- gation-mark after ‘cease.’ Moberly seems to adopt Delius’s view: ‘ “ Yes,” replies Albany, “ of the general fall and cessation of all things.” ’"

On the other hand, the last two lines are in character if spoken by the Duke, to whom dramatic etiquette gives the last word. Perhaps the true order might be restored by dividing these last few lines between them."

Collier (ed. 2) pronounces this change of “sight” to “light”, which is also found in the (MS), a very happy literal improvement.

This ‘ a dull sight: | Are you not Kent? The same; your servant Kent. | Hudson: ‘Sight’ can have no fitness here, unless as referring to Lear’s eyesight.

Rowe’s punctuation after ‘steps,’ which is followed above, in the text, seems better. Kent says, in effect, ‘I am the very man, and no one else, that has followed your sad steps.’ He does not catch either of Lear’s low apathetic replies: ‘I’ll see that straight’ and ‘You are welcome hither.’ This is also the view of Delius and of Clarke. But Ulrici objects to it, and says that not only does it leave ‘nor’ unaccounted for, but it is false in fact, since the Fool as well as Kent accompanied from the first Lear’s sad steps, and that, moreover, ‘else’ is unexplained. Instead of the present text, Ulrici proposes to transpose the ‘Nor’ and the ‘no’: \"No, nor man else,” that is, “No, neither I nor any other man is welcome here; here all’s cheerless, dark,” ’ &c.

      "notes": [
        "Steevens: my poor fool] This is an expression of tenderness for his dead Cordelia (not his Fool, as some have thought), on whose lips he is still intent, and dies away while he is searching there for indications of life. ‘Poor fool,’ in the age of Sh., was an expression of endearment. I may add, that the Fool of Lear was long ago forgotten. Having filled the space allotted him in the arrangement of the play, he appears to have been silently withdrawn, III, vi. That the thoughts of a father, in the bitterest of all moments, while his favourite child lay dead in his arms, should recur to the antick who had formerly diverted him, has somewhat in it that I cannot reconcile to the idea of genuine sorrow and despair. Besides this, Cordelia was recently hanged; but we know not that the Fool had suffered in the same manner, nor can imagine why he should. The party adverse to Lear was little interested in the fate of his jester. The only use of him was to contrast and alleviate the sorrows of his master; and, that purpose being fully answered, the poet’s solicitude about him was at an end. The term ‘poor fool’ might indeed have misbecome the mouth of a vassal commiserating the untimely end of a princess, but has no impropriety when used by a weak, old, distracted king, in whose mind the distinctions of nature only survive, while he is uttering his last frantic exclamations over a murdered daughter.",
        "Reynolds: my poor fool] Sir Joshua Reynolds: I confess I am one of those who have thought that Lear means his Fool, and not Cordelia. If he means Cordelia, then what I have always considered as a beauty, is of the same kind as the accidental stroke of the pencil that produced the foam. Lear’s affectionate remembrance of the Fool, in this place, I used to think, was one of those strokes of genius, or of nature, which are so often found in Sh., and in him only. Lear appears to have a particular affection for this Fool, whose fidelity in attending him, and endeavouring to divert him in his distress, seems to deserve all his kindness. ‘Poor fool and knave,’ says he, in the midst of the thunder-storm, ‘I have one part in my heart that’s sorry yet for thee.’ It does not, therefore, appear to me, to be allowing too much consequence to the Fool, in making Lear bestow a thought on him, even when in still greater distress. Lear is represented as a good-natured, passionate, and rather weak, old man; it is the old age of a cockered spoilt boy. There is no impropriety in giving to such a cha- racter those tender domestic affections which would ill become a more heroic cha- racter, such as Othello, Macbeth, or Richard III. The words, ‘No, no, no life,’ I suppose to be spoken, not tenderly, but with passion; Let nothing now live;—let there be universal destruction;—‘Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life, and thou no breath at all?’ It may be observed, that as there was a necessity, the necessity of propriety at least, that this Fool, the favourite of the author, of Lear, and consequently of the audience, should not be lost or forgot, it ought to be known what became of him. However, it must be acknowledged, that we cannot infer much from thence; Sh. is not always attentive to finish the figures of his groups. I have only to add, that if an actor, by adopting the interpretation mentioned above, should apply the words ‘poor fool’ to Cordelia, the audience would, I should imagine, think it a strange mode of expressing the grief and affection of a father for his dead daughter, and that daughter a queen. The words ‘poor fool’ are undoubtedly expressive of endearment, and Sh. himself, in another place, speaking of a dying animal, calls it ‘poor dappled fool,’ but it never is, nor never can be, used with any degree of propriety, but to commiserate some very inferior object, which may be loved, without much esteem or respect.",
        "Malone: my poor fool] I have not the smallest doubt that Mr Steevens’s interpretation of these words is the true one. The passage, indeed, before us appears to me so clear, and so inapplicable to any person but Cordelia, that I fear the reader may think any further comment on it altogether superfluous. It is observable that Lear, from the time of his entrance in this scene to his uttering these words, and from thence to his death, is wholly occupied by the loss of his daughter. He is diverted, indeed, from it for a moment by the intrusion of Kent, who forces himself on his notice; but he instantly returns to his beloved Cordelia, over whose dead body he continues to hang. He is now himself in the agony of death; and surely at such a time, when his heart is just breaking, it would be highly unnatural that he should think of his Fool. But the great and decisive objection to such a supposition is that which Mr Steevens has mentioned—that Lear had just seen his daughter hanged, having unfortunately been admitted too late to preserve her life, though time enough to punish the perpetrator of the act; but we have no authority whatsoever for supposing his Fool hanged also. Whether the expression ‘poor fool’ can be applied with propriety only to ‘inferior objects, for whom we have not much respect or esteem,’ is not, I conceive, the question. Sh. does not always use his terms with strict propriety, but he is always the best commentator on himself, and he certainly has applied this term in another place to the young, the beautiful, and innocent Adonis, the object of somewhat more than the esteem of a goddess; ‘For pity now she can no more detain him; The poor fool prays her that he may depart.’ In Old English a fool and an innocent were synonymous terms. Hence, probably, the peculiar use of the expression ‘poor fool.’ In the passage before us, Lear, I conceive, means by it dear, tender, helpless innocence!",
        "Rann: my poor fool] Rann: My hapless, innocent Cordelia,",
        "Knight: my poor fool] ‘ Poor fool ’ might indeed be here employed something like the ‘excellent wretch’ of Othello; but we cannot avoid thinking that Sh., in this place, meant to express a peculiar tenderness, derived from Lear’s confused recollection of his regard for his poor follower, the Fool. In the depth of his distress during the storm Lear says: ‘Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart that’s sorry yet for thee.’ And now, when the last and deepest calamity has fallen upon him, his expressions shape themselves out of the indistinctness with which he views the present and the past, and Cordelia is his ‘poor fool.’",
        "Collier: my poor fool] It may be urged that, as Cordelia had been hanged, the poet would have probably chosen some other death for the Fool, in order to render the matter quite clear, supposing Lear to have allowed his thoughts thus to wander from his daughter, lying dead before him. On the other hand, if Sh. did not mean to revert to the Fool, he has certainly omitted to account for a prominent and interesting character.",
        "Verplanck: my poor fool] With this customary and familiar use of the phrase, when the whole interest of the scene is fixed on Cordelia’s death, and Lear himself, in the same breath addressing her (‘And thou no breath at all? Thou’lt come no more’), it seems to me evident that it is to Cordelia alone that the phrase can allude,",
        "Hudson: my poor fool] These words refer, not to the Fool, but to Cordelia, on whose lips the old king is still intent, and dies while he is searching there for indications of life.",
        "W. W. Lloyd: my poor fool] I have no doubt that Sh. intended the Fool should be remembered in Lear’s last exclamation, though no more may be meant than that in his wandering state he confuses the image of the Fool with that of his daughter in his arms.",
        "Halliwell: my poor fool] ‘ Poor fool ’ was formerly a common phrase of endearment. So Julia, speaking of Proteus, says: \"Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him?\" The expression occurs as one of endearment, applied to a woman, in Cokain’s Trappolin Supposed a Prince, 1658: \"—You saw how I was employ’d; I could not leave the poor fool,—your lordship sees she loves me, and protest her labour is not lost.\" The old king is evidently thinking of his daughter, and knows the manner of her death, nay, kills the slave that did it, and here he exclaims immediately after calling her poor fool, ‘unbutton here, look on her,’ &c.",

But even here, where any other mind would have confined itself to the single passion of parental despair, Sh. contrives to indicate by a gesture the very train of internal physical changes which are causing death. The blood gathering about the heart can no longer be propelled by its enfeebled Impulse. Lear, too weak to relieve the impediments of his dress, which he imagines cause the sense of suffocation, asks a bystander to ‘undo this button.’"
