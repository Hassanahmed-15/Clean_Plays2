ACT 1 SCENE 1

1: First Gentleman: You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods
2: No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
3: Still seem as does the king.
4: Second Gentleman: But what's the matter?
5: First Gentleman: His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom
6: He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow
7: That late he married--hath referr'd herself
8: Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;
9: Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all
10: Is outward sorrow; though I think the king
11: Be touch'd at very heart.
12: Second Gentleman: None but the king?
13: First Gentleman: He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,
14: That most desired the match; but not a courtier,
15: Although they wear their faces to the bent
16: Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not
17: Glad at the thing they scowl at.
18: Second Gentleman: And why so?
19: First Gentleman: He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
20: Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--
21: I mean, that married her, alack, good man!
22: And therefore banish'd--is a creature such
23: As, to seek through the regions of the earth
24: For one his like, there would be something failing
25: In him that should compare. I do not think
26: So fair an outward and such stuff within
27: Endows a man but he.
28: Second Gentleman: You speak him far.
29: First Gentleman: I do extend him, sir, within himself,
30: Crush him together rather than unfold
31: His measure duly.
32: Second Gentleman: What's his name and birth?
33: First Gentleman: I cannot delve him to the root: his father
34: Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour
35: Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
36: But had his titles by Tenantius whom
37: He served with glory and admired success,
38: So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;
39: And had, besides this gentleman in question,
40: Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time
41: Died with their swords in hand; for which
42: their father,
43: Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
44: That he quit being, and his gentle lady,
45: Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased
46: As he was born. The king he takes the babe
47: To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
48: Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,
49: Puts to him all the learnings that his time
50: Could make him the receiver of; which he took,
51: As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,
52: And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--
53: Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,
54: A sample to the youngest, to the more mature
55: A glass that feated them, and to the graver
56: A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,
57: For whom he now is banish'd, her own price
58: Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;
59: By her election may be truly read
60: What kind of man he is.
61: Second Gentleman: I honour him
62: Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,
63: Is she sole child to the king?
64: First Gentleman: His only child.
65: He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,
66: Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,
67: I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery
68: Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge
69: Which way they went.
70: Second Gentleman: How long is this ago?
71: First Gentleman: Some twenty years.
72: Second Gentleman: That a king's children should be so convey'd,
73: So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,
74: That could not trace them!
75: First Gentleman: Howsoe'er 'tis strange,
76: Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,
77: Yet is it true, sir.
78: Second Gentleman: I do well believe you.
79: First Gentleman: We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,
80: The queen, and princess.
81: QUEEN: No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,
82: After the slander of most stepmothers,
83: Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but
84: Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
85: That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,
86: So soon as I can win the offended king,
87: I will be known your advocate: marry, yet
88: The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good
89: You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience
90: Your wisdom may inform you.
91: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Please your highness,
92: I will from hence to-day.
93: QUEEN: You know the peril.
94: I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying
95: The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king
96: Hath charged you should not speak together.
97: IMOGEN: O
98: Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
99: Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,
100: I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--
101: Always reserved my holy duty--what
102: His rage can do on me: you must be gone;
103: And I shall here abide the hourly shot
104: Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
105: But that there is this jewel in the world
106: That I may see again.
107: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: My queen! my mistress!
108: O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
109: To be suspected of more tenderness
110: Than doth become a man. I will remain
111: The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:
112: My residence in Rome at one Philario's,
113: Who to my father was a friend, to me
114: Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,
115: And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,
116: Though ink be made of gall.
117: QUEEN: Be brief, I pray you:
118: If the king come, I shall incur I know not
119: How much of his displeasure.
120: Yet I'll move him
121: To walk this way: I never do him wrong,
122: But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;
123: Pays dear for my offences.
124: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Should we be taking leave
125: As long a term as yet we have to live,
126: The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!
127: IMOGEN: Nay, stay a little:
128: Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
129: Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;
130: This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;
131: But keep it till you woo another wife,
132: When Imogen is dead.
133: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: How, how! another?
134: You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
135: And sear up my embracements from a next
136: With bonds of death!
137: Remain, remain thou here
138: While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,
139: As I my poor self did exchange for you,
140: To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles
141: I still win of you: for my sake wear this;
142: It is a manacle of love; I'll place it
143: Upon this fairest prisoner.
144: IMOGEN: O the gods!
145: When shall we see again?
146: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Alack, the king!
147: CYMBELINE: Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!
148: If after this command thou fraught the court
149: With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!
150: Thou'rt poison to my blood.
151: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: The gods protect you!
152: And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.
153: IMOGEN: There cannot be a pinch in death
154: More sharp than this is.
155: CYMBELINE: O disloyal thing,
156: That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st
157: A year's age on me.
158: IMOGEN: I beseech you, sir,
159: Harm not yourself with your vexation
160: I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare
161: Subdues all pangs, all fears.
162: CYMBELINE: Past grace? obedience?
163: IMOGEN: Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.
164: CYMBELINE: That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!
165: IMOGEN: O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,
166: And did avoid a puttock.
167: CYMBELINE: Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne
168: A seat for baseness.
169: IMOGEN: No; I rather added
170: A lustre to it.
171: CYMBELINE: O thou vile one!
172: IMOGEN: Sir,
173: It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:
174: You bred him as my playfellow, and he is
175: A man worth any woman, overbuys me
176: Almost the sum he pays.
177: CYMBELINE: What, art thou mad?
178: IMOGEN: Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were
179: A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
180: Our neighbour shepherd's son!
181: CYMBELINE: Thou foolish thing!
182: They were again together: you have done
183: Not after our command. Away with her,
184: And pen her up.
185: QUEEN: Beseech your patience. Peace,
186: Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,
187: Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort
188: Out of your best advice.
189: CYMBELINE: Nay, let her languish
190: A drop of blood a day; and, being aged,
191: Die of this folly!
192: QUEEN: Fie! you must give way.
193: Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?
194: PISANIO: My lord your son drew on my master.
195: QUEEN: Ha!
196: No harm, I trust, is done?
197: PISANIO: There might have been,
198: But that my master rather play'd than fought
199: And had no help of anger: they were parted
200: By gentlemen at hand.
201: QUEEN: I am very glad on't.
202: IMOGEN: Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.
203: To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!
204: I would they were in Afric both together;
205: Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
206: The goer-back. Why came you from your master?
207: PISANIO: On his command: he would not suffer me
208: To bring him to the haven; left these notes
209: Of what commands I should be subject to,
210: When 't pleased you to employ me.
211: QUEEN: This hath been
212: Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour
213: He will remain so.
214: PISANIO: I humbly thank your highness.
215: QUEEN: Pray, walk awhile.
216: IMOGEN: About some half-hour hence,
217: I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least
218: Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.
ACT 1 SCENE 2

1: First Lord: Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the
2: violence of action hath made you reek as a
3: sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:
4: there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
5: CLOTEN: If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?
6: Second Lord: [Aside] No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.
7: First Lord: Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be
8: not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.
9: Second Lord: [Aside] His steel was in debt; it went o' the
10: backside the town.
11: CLOTEN: The villain would not stand me.
12: Second Lord: [Aside] No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.
13: First Lord: Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but
14: he added to your having; gave you some ground.
15: Second Lord: [Aside] As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!
16: CLOTEN: I would they had not come between us.
17: Second Lord: [Aside] So would I, till you had measured how long
18: a fool you were upon the ground.
19: CLOTEN: And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!
20: Second Lord: [Aside] If it be a sin to make a true election, she
21: is damned.
22: First Lord: Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain
23: go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen
24: small reflection of her wit.
25: Second Lord: [Aside] She shines not upon fools, lest the
26: reflection should hurt her.
27: CLOTEN: Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some
28: hurt done!
29: Second Lord: [Aside] I wish not so; unless it had been the fall
30: of an ass, which is no great hurt.
31: CLOTEN: You'll go with us?
32: First Lord: I'll attend your lordship.
33: CLOTEN: Nay, come, let's go together.
34: Second Lord: Well, my lord.
ACT 1 SCENE 3

1: IMOGEN: I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,
2: And question'dst every sail: if he should write
3: And not have it, 'twere a paper lost,
4: As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
5: That he spake to thee?
6: PISANIO: It was his queen, his queen!
7: IMOGEN: Then waved his handkerchief?
8: PISANIO: And kiss'd it, madam.
9: IMOGEN: Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!
10: And that was all?
11: PISANIO: No, madam; for so long
12: As he could make me with this eye or ear
13: Distinguish him from others, he did keep
14: The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,
15: Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind
16: Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,
17: How swift his ship.
18: IMOGEN: Thou shouldst have made him
19: As little as a crow, or less, ere left
20: To after-eye him.
21: PISANIO: Madam, so I did.
22: IMOGEN: I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but
23: To look upon him, till the diminution
24: Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,
25: Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from
26: The smallness of a gnat to air, and then
27: Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,
28: When shall we hear from him?
29: PISANIO: Be assured, madam,
30: With his next vantage.
31: IMOGEN: I did not take my leave of him, but had
32: Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him
33: How I would think on him at certain hours
34: Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear
35: The shes of Italy should not betray
36: Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,
37: At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,
38: To encounter me with orisons, for then
39: I am in heaven for him; or ere I could
40: Give him that parting kiss which I had set
41: Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father
42: And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
43: Shakes all our buds from growing.
44: Lady: The queen, madam,
45: Desires your highness' company.
46: IMOGEN: Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.
47: I will attend the queen.
48: PISANIO: Madam, I shall.
ACT 1 SCENE 4

1: IACHIMO: Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he was
2: then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy
3: as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I
4: could then have looked on him without the help of
5: admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments
6: had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.
7: PHILARIO: You speak of him when he was less furnished than now
8: he is with that which makes him both without and within.
9: Frenchman: I have seen him in France: we had very many there
10: could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.
11: IACHIMO: This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein
12: he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,
13: words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.
14: Frenchman: And then his banishment.
15: IACHIMO: Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this
16: lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully
17: to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,
18: which else an easy battery might lay flat, for
19: taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes
20: it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps
21: acquaintance?
22: PHILARIO: His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I
23: have been often bound for no less than my life.
24: Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained
25: amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your
26: knowing, to a stranger of his quality.
27: I beseech you all, be better known to this
28: gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend
29: of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear
30: hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.
31: Frenchman: Sir, we have known together in Orleans.
32: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,
33: which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.
34: Frenchman: Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I
35: did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity
36: you should have been put together with so mortal a
37: purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so
38: slight and trivial a nature.
39: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;
40: rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in
41: my every action to be guided by others' experiences:
42: but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to say
43: it is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.
44: Frenchman: 'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,
45: and by such two that would by all likelihood have
46: confounded one the other, or have fallen both.
47: IACHIMO: Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?
48: Frenchman: Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,
49: which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.
50: It was much like an argument that fell out last
51: night, where each of us fell in praise of our
52: country mistresses; this gentleman at that time
53: vouching--and upon warrant of bloody
54: affirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,
55: chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable
56: than any the rarest of our ladies in France.
57: IACHIMO: That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's
58: opinion by this worn out.
59: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: She holds her virtue still and I my mind.
60: IACHIMO: You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.
61: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would
62: abate her nothing, though I profess myself her
63: adorer, not her friend.
64: IACHIMO: As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand
65: comparison--had been something too fair and too good
66: for any lady in Britain. If she went before others
67: I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres
68: many I have beheld. I could not but believe she
69: excelled many: but I have not seen the most
70: precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.
71: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.
72: IACHIMO: What do you esteem it at?
73: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: More than the world enjoys.
74: IACHIMO: Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's
75: outprized by a trifle.
76: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, if
77: there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit
78: for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,
79: and only the gift of the gods.
80: IACHIMO: Which the gods have given you?
81: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Which, by their graces, I will keep.
82: IACHIMO: You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,
83: strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your
84: ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable
85: estimations; the one is but frail and the other
86: casual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished
87: courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.
88: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier
89: to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the
90: holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do
91: nothing doubt you have store of thieves;
92: notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.
93: PHILARIO: Let us leave here, gentlemen.
94: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I
95: thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.
96: IACHIMO: With five times so much conversation, I should get
97: ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even
98: to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.
99: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: No, no.
100: IACHIMO: I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to
101: your ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it
102: something: but I make my wager rather against your
103: confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your
104: offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any
105: lady in the world.
106: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: You are a great deal abused in too bold a
107: persuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you're
108: worthy of by your attempt.
109: IACHIMO: What's that?
110: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,
111: deserve more; a punishment too.
112: PHILARIO: Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;
113: let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be
114: better acquainted.
115: IACHIMO: Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the
116: approbation of what I have spoke!
117: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: What lady would you choose to assail?
118: IACHIMO: Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.
119: I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,
120: that, commend me to the court where your lady is,
121: with no more advantage than the opportunity of a
122: second conference, and I will bring from thence
123: that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.
124: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring
125: I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.
126: IACHIMO: You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy
127: ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot
128: preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some
129: religion in you, that you fear.
130: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a
131: graver purpose, I hope.
132: IACHIMO: I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo
133: what's spoken, I swear.
134: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your
135: return: let there be covenants drawn between's: my
136: mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your
137: unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.
138: PHILARIO: I will have it no lay.
139: IACHIMO: By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no
140: sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest
141: bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats
142: are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,
143: and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,
144: she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are
145: yours: provided I have your commendation for my more
146: free entertainment.
147: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: I embrace these conditions; let us have articles
148: betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if
149: you make your voyage upon her and give me directly
150: to understand you have prevailed, I am no further
151: your enemy; she is not worth our debate: if she
152: remain unseduced, you not making it appear
153: otherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault you
154: have made to her chastity you shall answer me with
155: your sword.
156: IACHIMO: Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things set
157: down by lawful counsel, and straight away for
158: Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and
159: starve: I will fetch my gold and have our two
160: wagers recorded.
161: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Agreed.
162: Frenchman: Will this hold, think you?
163: PHILARIO: Signior Iachimo will not from it.
164: Pray, let us follow 'em.
ACT 1 SCENE 5

1: QUEEN: Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers;
2: Make haste: who has the note of them?
3: First Lady: I, madam.
4: QUEEN: Dispatch.
5: Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?
6: CORNELIUS: Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:
7: But I beseech your grace, without offence,--
8: My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have
9: Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,
10: Which are the movers of a languishing death;
11: But though slow, deadly?
12: QUEEN: I wonder, doctor,
13: Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been
14: Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how
15: To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so
16: That our great king himself doth woo me oft
17: For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,--
18: Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meet
19: That I did amplify my judgment in
20: Other conclusions? I will try the forces
21: Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
22: We count not worth the hanging, but none human,
23: To try the vigour of them and apply
24: Allayments to their act, and by them gather
25: Their several virtues and effects.
26: CORNELIUS: Your highness
27: Shall from this practise but make hard your heart:
28: Besides, the seeing these effects will be
29: Both noisome and infectious.
30: QUEEN: O, content thee.
31: Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him
32: Will I first work: he's for his master,
33: An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!
34: Doctor, your service for this time is ended;
35: Take your own way.
36: CORNELIUS: [Aside] I do suspect you, madam;
37: But you shall do no harm.
38: QUEEN: [To PISANIO] Hark thee, a word.
39: CORNELIUS: [Aside] I do not like her. She doth think she has
40: Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,
41: And will not trust one of her malice with
42: A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
43: Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;
44: Which first, perchance, she'll prove on
45: cats and dogs,
46: Then afterward up higher: but there is
47: No danger in what show of death it makes,
48: More than the locking-up the spirits a time,
49: To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd
50: With a most false effect; and I the truer,
51: So to be false with her.
52: QUEEN: No further service, doctor,
53: Until I send for thee.
54: CORNELIUS: I humbly take my leave.
55: QUEEN: Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time
56: She will not quench and let instructions enter
57: Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:
58: When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
59: I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
60: As great as is thy master, greater, for
61: His fortunes all lie speechless and his name
62: Is at last gasp: return he cannot, nor
63: Continue where he is: to shift his being
64: Is to exchange one misery with another,
65: And every day that comes comes to decay
66: A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,
67: To be depender on a thing that leans,
68: Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,
69: So much as but to prop him?
70: Thou takest up
71: Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:
72: It is a thing I made, which hath the king
73: Five times redeem'd from death: I do not know
74: What is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it;
75: It is an earnest of a further good
76: That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
77: The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.
78: Think what a chance thou changest on, but think
79: Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,
80: Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the king
81: To any shape of thy preferment such
82: As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,
83: That set thee on to this desert, am bound
84: To load thy merit richly. Call my women:
85: Think on my words.
86: A sly and constant knave,
87: Not to be shaked; the agent for his master
88: And the remembrancer of her to hold
89: The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that
90: Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her
91: Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,
92: Except she bend her humour, shall be assured
93: To taste of too.
94: So, so: well done, well done:
95: The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,
96: Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;
97: Think on my words.
98: PISANIO: And shall do:
99: But when to my good lord I prove untrue,
100: I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.
ACT 1 SCENE 6

1: IMOGEN: A father cruel, and a step-dame false;
2: A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,
3: That hath her husband banish'd;--O, that husband!
4: My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated
5: Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,
6: As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable
7: Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,
8: How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,
9: Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!
10: PISANIO: Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,
11: Comes from my lord with letters.
12: IACHIMO: Change you, madam?
13: The worthy Leonatus is in safety
14: And greets your highness dearly.
15: IMOGEN: Thanks, good sir:
16: You're kindly welcome.
17: IACHIMO: [Aside] All of her that is out of door most rich!
18: If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,
19: She is alone the Arabian bird, and I
20: Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!
21: Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!
22: Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;
23: Rather directly fly.
24: IMOGEN: [Reads] 'He is one of the noblest note, to whose
25: kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon
26: him accordingly, as you value your trust--
27: LEONATUS.'
28: So far I read aloud:
29: But even the very middle of my heart
30: Is warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully.
31: You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I
32: Have words to bid you, and shall find it so
33: In all that I can do.
34: IACHIMO: Thanks, fairest lady.
35: What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes
36: To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop
37: Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt
38: The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones
39: Upon the number'd beach? and can we not
40: Partition make with spectacles so precious
41: 'Twixt fair and foul?
42: IMOGEN: What makes your admiration?
43: IACHIMO: It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys
44: 'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
45: Contemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgment,
46: For idiots in this case of favour would
47: Be wisely definite; nor i' the appetite;
48: Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed
49: Should make desire vomit emptiness,
50: Not so allured to feed.
51: IMOGEN: What is the matter, trow?
52: IACHIMO: The cloyed will,
53: That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub
54: Both fill'd and running, ravening first the lamb
55: Longs after for the garbage.
56: IMOGEN: What, dear sir,
57: Thus raps you? Are you well?
58: IACHIMO: Thanks, madam; well.
59: Beseech you, sir, desire
60: My man's abode where I did leave him: he
61: Is strange and peevish.
62: PISANIO: I was going, sir,
63: To give him welcome.
64: IMOGEN: Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?
65: IACHIMO: Well, madam.
66: IMOGEN: Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.
67: IACHIMO: Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
68: So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd
69: The Briton reveller.
70: IMOGEN: When he was here,
71: He did incline to sadness, and oft-times
72: Not knowing why.
73: IACHIMO: I never saw him sad.
74: There is a Frenchman his companion, one
75: An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves
76: A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces
77: The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton--
78: Your lord, I mean--laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,
79: Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows
80: By history, report, or his own proof,
81: What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose
82: But must be, will his free hours languish for
83: Assured bondage?'
84: IMOGEN: Will my lord say so?
85: IACHIMO: Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:
86: It is a recreation to be by
87: And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,
88: Some men are much to blame.
89: IMOGEN: Not he, I hope.
90: IACHIMO: Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
91: Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;
92: In you, which I account his beyond all talents,
93: Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound
94: To pity too.
95: IMOGEN: What do you pity, sir?
96: IACHIMO: Two creatures heartily.
97: IMOGEN: Am I one, sir?
98: You look on me: what wreck discern you in me
99: Deserves your pity?
100: IACHIMO: Lamentable! What,
101: To hide me from the radiant sun and solace
102: I' the dungeon by a snuff?
103: IMOGEN: I pray you, sir,
104: Deliver with more openness your answers
105: To my demands. Why do you pity me?
106: IACHIMO: That others do--
107: I was about to say--enjoy your--But
108: It is an office of the gods to venge it,
109: Not mine to speak on 't.
110: IMOGEN: You do seem to know
111: Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,--
112: Since doubling things go ill often hurts more
113: Than to be sure they do; for certainties
114: Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,
115: The remedy then born--discover to me
116: What both you spur and stop.
117: IACHIMO: Had I this cheek
118: To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,
119: Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul
120: To the oath of loyalty; this object, which
121: Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,
122: Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,
123: Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
124: That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands
125: Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, as
126: With labour; then by-peeping in an eye
127: Base and unlustrous as the smoky light
128: That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit
129: That all the plagues of hell should at one time
130: Encounter such revolt.
131: IMOGEN: My lord, I fear,
132: Has forgot Britain.
133: IACHIMO: And himself. Not I,
134: Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce
135: The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces
136: That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue
137: Charms this report out.
138: IMOGEN: Let me hear no more.
139: IACHIMO: O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart
140: With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady
141: So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,
142: Would make the great'st king double,--to be partner'd
143: With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition
144: Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures
145: That play with all infirmities for gold
146: Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff
147: As well might poison poison! Be revenged;
148: Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
149: Recoil from your great stock.
150: IMOGEN: Revenged!
151: How should I be revenged? If this be true,--
152: As I have such a heart that both mine ears
153: Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,
154: How should I be revenged?
155: IACHIMO: Should he make me
156: Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,
157: Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,
158: In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.
159: I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,
160: More noble than that runagate to your bed,
161: And will continue fast to your affection,
162: Still close as sure.
163: IMOGEN: What, ho, Pisanio!
164: IACHIMO: Let me my service tender on your lips.
165: IMOGEN: Away! I do condemn mine ears that have
166: So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,
167: Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not
168: For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange.
169: Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far
170: From thy report as thou from honour, and
171: Solicit'st here a lady that disdains
172: Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!
173: The king my father shall be made acquainted
174: Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,
175: A saucy stranger in his court to mart
176: As in a Romish stew and to expound
177: His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
178: He little cares for and a daughter who
179: He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!
180: IACHIMO: O happy Leonatus! I may say
181: The credit that thy lady hath of thee
182: Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness
183: Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!
184: A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
185: Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only
186: For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.
187: I have spoke this, to know if your affiance
188: Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,
189: That which he is, new o'er: and he is one
190: The truest manner'd; such a holy witch
191: That he enchants societies into him;
192: Half all men's hearts are his.
193: IMOGEN: You make amends.
194: IACHIMO: He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:
195: He hath a kind of honour sets him off,
196: More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,
197: Most mighty princess, that I have adventured
198: To try your taking a false report; which hath
199: Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment
200: In the election of a sir so rare,
201: Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him
202: Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,
203: Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.
204: IMOGEN: All's well, sir: take my power i' the court
205: for yours.
206: IACHIMO: My humble thanks. I had almost forgot
207: To entreat your grace but in a small request,
208: And yet of moment to, for it concerns
209: Your lord; myself and other noble friends,
210: Are partners in the business.
211: IMOGEN: Pray, what is't?
212: IACHIMO: Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--
213: The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums
214: To buy a present for the emperor
215: Which I, the factor for the rest, have done
216: In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels
217: Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;
218: And I am something curious, being strange,
219: To have them in safe stowage: may it please you
220: To take them in protection?
221: IMOGEN: Willingly;
222: And pawn mine honour for their safety: since
223: My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
224: In my bedchamber.
225: IACHIMO: They are in a trunk,
226: Attended by my men: I will make bold
227: To send them to you, only for this night;
228: I must aboard to-morrow.
229: IMOGEN: O, no, no.
230: IACHIMO: Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word
231: By lengthening my return. From Gallia
232: I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise
233: To see your grace.
234: IMOGEN: I thank you for your pains:
235: But not away to-morrow!
236: IACHIMO: O, I must, madam:
237: Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please
238: To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night:
239: I have outstood my time; which is material
240: To the tender of our present.
ACT 2 SCENE 1

1: CLOTEN: Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed the
2: jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a
3: hundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapes
4: must take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mine
5: oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.
6: First Lord: What got he by that? You have broke his pate with
7: your bowl.
8: Second Lord: [Aside] If his wit had been like him that broke it,
9: it would have run all out.
10: CLOTEN: When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not for
11: any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?
12: Second Lord: No my lord;
13: nor crop the ears of them.
14: CLOTEN: Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction?
15: Would he had been one of my rank!
16: Second Lord: [Aside] To have smelt like a fool.
17: CLOTEN: I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a
18: pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am;
19: they dare not fight with me, because of the queen my
20: mother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful of
21: fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that
22: nobody can match.
23: Second Lord: [Aside] You are cock and capon too; and you crow,
24: cock, with your comb on.
25: CLOTEN: Sayest thou?
26: Second Lord: It is not fit your lordship should undertake every
27: companion that you give offence to.
28: CLOTEN: No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit
29: offence to my inferiors.
30: Second Lord: Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.
31: CLOTEN: Why, so I say.
32: First Lord: Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?
33: CLOTEN: A stranger, and I not know on't!
34: Second Lord: [Aside] He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it
35: not.
36: First Lord: There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one of
37: Leonatus' friends.
38: CLOTEN: Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he's another,
39: whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?
40: First Lord: One of your lordship's pages.
41: CLOTEN: Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no
42: derogation in't?
43: Second Lord: You cannot derogate, my lord.
44: CLOTEN: Not easily, I think.
45: Second Lord: [Aside] You are a fool granted; therefore your
46: issues, being foolish, do not derogate.
47: CLOTEN: Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lost
48: to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.
49: Second Lord: I'll attend your lordship.
50: That such a crafty devil as is his mother
51: Should yield the world this ass! a woman that
52: Bears all down with her brain; and this her son
53: Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,
54: And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
55: Thou divine Imogen, what thou endurest,
56: Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,
57: A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer
58: More hateful than the foul expulsion is
59: Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
60: Of the divorce he'ld make! The heavens hold firm
61: The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshaked
62: That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand,
63: To enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!
ACT 2 SCENE 2

1: IMOGEN: Who's there? my woman Helen?
2: Lady: Please you, madam
3: IMOGEN: What hour is it?
4: Lady: Almost midnight, madam.
5: IMOGEN: I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak:
6: Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed:
7: Take not away the taper, leave it burning;
8: And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock,
9: I prithee, call me. Sleep hath seized me wholly
10: To your protection I commend me, gods.
11: From fairies and the tempters of the night
12: Guard me, beseech ye.
13: IACHIMO: The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense
14: Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus
15: Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken'd
16: The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,
17: How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,
18: And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!
19: But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,
20: How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that
21: Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taper
22: Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,
23: To see the enclosed lights, now canopied
24: Under these windows, white and azure laced
25: With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,
26: To note the chamber: I will write all down:
27: Such and such pictures; there the window; such
28: The adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,
29: Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.
30: Ah, but some natural notes about her body,
31: Above ten thousand meaner moveables
32: Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.
33: O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!
34: And be her sense but as a monument,
35: Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off:
36: As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!
37: 'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,
38: As strongly as the conscience does within,
39: To the madding of her lord. On her left breast
40: A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
41: I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,
42: Stronger than ever law could make: this secret
43: Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en
44: The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?
45: Why should I write this down, that's riveted,
46: Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late
47: The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down
48: Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:
49: To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.
50: Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning
51: May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;
52: Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.
53: One, two, three: time, time!
54: Scene III: An ante-chamber adjoining Imogen's apartments.
55: First Lord: Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the
56: most coldest that ever turned up ace.
57: CLOTEN: It would make any man cold to lose.
58: First Lord: But not every man patient after the noble temper of
59: your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.
60: CLOTEN: Winning will put any man into courage. If I could
61: get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough.
62: It's almost morning, is't not?
63: First Lord: Day, my lord.
64: CLOTEN: I would this music would come: I am advised to give
65: her music o' mornings; they say it will penetrate.
66: Come on; tune: if you can penetrate her with your
67: fingering, so; we'll try with tongue too: if none
68: will do, let her remain; but I'll never give o'er.
69: First, a very excellent good-conceited thing;
70: after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich
71: words to it: and then let her consider.
72: Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,
73: And Phoebus 'gins arise,
74: His steeds to water at those springs
75: On chaliced flowers that lies;
76: And winking Mary-buds begin
77: To ope their golden eyes:
78: With every thing that pretty is,
79: My lady sweet, arise:
80: Arise, arise.
81: So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will
82: consider your music the better: if it do not, it is
83: a vice in her ears, which horse-hairs and
84: calves'-guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to
85: boot, can never amend.
86: Second Lord: Here comes the king.
87: CLOTEN: I am glad I was up so late; for that's the reason I
88: was up so early: he cannot choose but take this
89: service I have done fatherly.
90: Good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother.
91: CYMBELINE: Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?
92: Will she not forth?
93: CLOTEN: I have assailed her with music, but she vouchsafes no notice.
94: CYMBELINE: The exile of her minion is too new;
95: She hath not yet forgot him: some more time
96: Must wear the print of his remembrance out,
97: And then she's yours.
98: QUEEN: You are most bound to the king,
99: Who lets go by no vantages that may
100: Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself
101: To orderly soliciting, and be friended
102: With aptness of the season; make denials
103: Increase your services; so seem as if
104: You were inspired to do those duties which
105: You tender to her; that you in all obey her,
106: Save when command to your dismission tends,
107: And therein you are senseless.
108: CLOTEN: Senseless! not so.
109: Messenger: So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;
110: The one is Caius Lucius.
111: CYMBELINE: A worthy fellow,
112: Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;
113: But that's no fault of his: we must receive him
114: According to the honour of his sender;
115: And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,
116: We must extend our notice. Our dear son,
117: When you have given good morning to your mistress,
118: Attend the queen and us; we shall have need
119: To employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.
120: CLOTEN: If she be up, I'll speak with her; if not,
121: Let her lie still and dream.
122: By your leave, ho!
123: I Know her women are about her: what
124: If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold
125: Which buys admittance; oft it doth; yea, and makes
126: Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up
127: Their deer to the stand o' the stealer; and 'tis gold
128: Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;
129: Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: what
130: Can it not do and undo? I will make
131: One of her women lawyer to me, for
132: I yet not understand the case myself.
133: By your leave.
134: Lady: Who's there that knocks?
135: CLOTEN: A gentleman.
136: Lady: No more?
137: CLOTEN: Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.
138: Lady: That's more
139: Than some, whose tailors are as dear as yours,
140: Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?
141: CLOTEN: Your lady's person: is she ready?
142: Lady: Ay,
143: To keep her chamber.
144: CLOTEN: There is gold for you;
145: Sell me your good report.
146: Lady: How! my good name? or to report of you
147: What I shall think is good?--The princess!
148: CLOTEN: Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand.
149: IMOGEN: Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains
150: For purchasing but trouble; the thanks I give
151: Is telling you that I am poor of thanks
152: And scarce can spare them.
153: CLOTEN: Still, I swear I love you.
154: IMOGEN: If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me:
155: If you swear still, your recompense is still
156: That I regard it not.
157: CLOTEN: This is no answer.
158: IMOGEN: But that you shall not say I yield being silent,
159: I would not speak. I pray you, spare me: 'faith,
160: I shall unfold equal discourtesy
161: To your best kindness: one of your great knowing
162: Should learn, being taught, forbearance.
163: CLOTEN: To leave you in your madness, 'twere my sin:
164: I will not.
165: IMOGEN: Fools are not mad folks.
166: CLOTEN: Do you call me fool?
167: IMOGEN: As I am mad, I do:
168: If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;
169: That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,
170: You put me to forget a lady's manners,
171: By being so verbal: and learn now, for all,
172: That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,
173: By the very truth of it, I care not for you,
174: And am so near the lack of charity--
175: To accuse myself--I hate you; which I had rather
176: You felt than make't my boast.
177: CLOTEN: You sin against
178: Obedience, which you owe your father. For
179: The contract you pretend with that base wretch,
180: One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,
181: With scraps o' the court, it is no contract, none:
182: And though it be allow'd in meaner parties--
183: Yet who than he more mean?--to knit their souls,
184: On whom there is no more dependency
185: But brats and beggary, in self-figured knot;
186: Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by
187: The consequence o' the crown, and must not soil
188: The precious note of it with a base slave.
189: A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
190: A pantler, not so eminent.
191: IMOGEN: Profane fellow
192: Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more
193: But what thou art besides, thou wert too base
194: To be his groom: thou wert dignified enough,
195: Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made
196: Comparative for your virtues, to be styled
197: The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated
198: For being preferred so well.
199: CLOTEN: The south-fog rot him!
200: IMOGEN: He never can meet more mischance than come
201: To be but named of thee. His meanest garment,
202: That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearer
203: In my respect than all the hairs above thee,
204: Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!
205: CLOTEN: 'His garment!' Now the devil--
206: IMOGEN: To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently--
207: CLOTEN: 'His garment!'
208: IMOGEN: I am sprited with a fool.
209: Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my woman
210: Search for a jewel that too casually
211: Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me,
212: If I would lose it for a revenue
213: Of any king's in Europe. I do think
214: I saw't this morning: confident I am
215: Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:
216: I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
217: That I kiss aught but he.
218: PISANIO: 'Twill not be lost.
219: IMOGEN: I hope so: go and search.
220: CLOTEN: You have abused me:
221: 'His meanest garment!'
222: IMOGEN: Ay, I said so, sir:
223: If you will make't an action, call witness to't.
224: CLOTEN: I will inform your father.
225: IMOGEN: Your mother too:
226: She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,
227: But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir,
228: To the worst of discontent.
229: CLOTEN: I'll be revenged:
230: 'His meanest garment!' Well.
231: CYMBELINE
ACT 2 SCENE 4

1: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Fear it not, sir: I would I were so sure
2: To win the king as I am bold her honour
3: Will remain hers.
4: PHILARIO: What means do you make to him?
5: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Not any, but abide the change of time,
6: Quake in the present winter's state and wish
7: That warmer days would come: in these sear'd hopes,
8: I barely gratify your love; they failing,
9: I must die much your debtor.
10: PHILARIO: Your very goodness and your company
11: O'erpays all I can do. By this, your king
12: Hath heard of great Augustus: Caius Lucius
13: Will do's commission throughly: and I think
14: He'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,
15: Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance
16: Is yet fresh in their grief.
17: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: I do believe,
18: Statist though I am none, nor like to be,
19: That this will prove a war; and you shall hear
20: The legions now in Gallia sooner landed
21: In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings
22: Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen
23: Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar
24: Smiled at their lack of skill, but found
25: their courage
26: Worthy his frowning at: their discipline,
27: Now mingled with their courages, will make known
28: To their approvers they are people such
29: That mend upon the world.
30: PHILARIO: See! Iachimo!
31: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: The swiftest harts have posted you by land;
32: And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,
33: To make your vessel nimble.
34: PHILARIO: Welcome, sir.
35: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: I hope the briefness of your answer made
36: The speediness of your return.
37: IACHIMO: Your lady
38: Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.
39: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: And therewithal the best; or let her beauty
40: Look through a casement to allure false hearts
41: And be false with them.
42: IACHIMO: Here are letters for you.
43: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Their tenor good, I trust.
44: IACHIMO: 'Tis very like.
45: PHILARIO: Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
46: When you were there?
47: IACHIMO: He was expected then,
48: But not approach'd.
49: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: All is well yet.
50: Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't not
51: Too dull for your good wearing?
52: IACHIMO: If I had lost it,
53: I should have lost the worth of it in gold.
54: I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy
55: A second night of such sweet shortness which
56: Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.
57: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: The stone's too hard to come by.
58: IACHIMO: Not a whit,
59: Your lady being so easy.
60: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Make not, sir,
61: Your loss your sport: I hope you know that we
62: Must not continue friends.
63: IACHIMO: Good sir, we must,
64: If you keep covenant. Had I not brought
65: The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant
66: We were to question further: but I now
67: Profess myself the winner of her honour,
68: Together with your ring; and not the wronger
69: Of her or you, having proceeded but
70: By both your wills.
71: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: If you can make't apparent
72: That you have tasted her in bed, my hand
73: And ring is yours; if not, the foul opinion
74: You had of her pure honour gains or loses
75: Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both
76: To who shall find them.
77: IACHIMO: Sir, my circumstances,
78: Being so near the truth as I will make them,
79: Must first induce you to believe: whose strength
80: I will confirm with oath; which, I doubt not,
81: You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find
82: You need it not.
83: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Proceed.
84: IACHIMO: First, her bedchamber,--
85: Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess
86: Had that was well worth watching--it was hang'd
87: With tapesty of silk and silver; the story
88: Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,
89: And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for
90: The press of boats or pride: a piece of work
91: So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive
92: In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd
93: Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,
94: Since the true life on't was--
95: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: This is true;
96: And this you might have heard of here, by me,
97: Or by some other.
98: IACHIMO: More particulars
99: Must justify my knowledge.
100: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: So they must,
101: Or do your honour injury.
102: IACHIMO: The chimney
103: Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece
104: Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures
105: So likely to report themselves: the cutter
106: Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her,
107: Motion and breath left out.
108: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: This is a thing
109: Which you might from relation likewise reap,
110: Being, as it is, much spoke of.
111: IACHIMO: The roof o' the chamber
112: With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons--
113: I had forgot them--were two winking Cupids
114: Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely
115: Depending on their brands.
116: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: This is her honour!
117: Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praise
118: Be given to your remembrance--the description
119: Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
120: The wager you have laid.
121: IACHIMO: Then, if you can,
122: Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!
123: And now 'tis up again: it must be married
124: To that your diamond; I'll keep them.
125: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Jove!
126: Once more let me behold it: is it that
127: Which I left with her?
128: IACHIMO: Sir--I thank her--that:
129: She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;
130: Her pretty action did outsell her gift,
131: And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me, and said
132: She prized it once.
133: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: May be she pluck'd it off
134: To send it me.
135: IACHIMO: She writes so to you, doth she?
136: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;
137: It is a basilisk unto mine eye,
138: Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour
139: Where there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love,
140: Where there's another man: the vows of women
141: Of no more bondage be, to where they are made,
142: Than they are to their virtues; which is nothing.
143: O, above measure false!
144: PHILARIO: Have patience, sir,
145: And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:
146: It may be probable she lost it; or
147: Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted,
148: Hath stol'n it from her?
149: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Very true;
150: And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring:
151: Render to me some corporal sign about her,
152: More evident than this; for this was stolen.
153: IACHIMO: By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.
154: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.
155: 'Tis true:--nay, keep the ring--'tis true: I am sure
156: She would not lose it: her attendants are
157: All sworn and honourable:--they induced to steal it!
158: And by a stranger!--No, he hath enjoyed her:
159: The cognizance of her incontinency
160: Is this: she hath bought the name of whore
161: thus dearly.
162: There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell
163: Divide themselves between you!
164: PHILARIO: Sir, be patient:
165: This is not strong enough to be believed
166: Of one persuaded well of--
167: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Never talk on't;
168: She hath been colted by him.
169: IACHIMO: If you seek
170: For further satisfying, under her breast--
171: Worthy the pressing--lies a mole, right proud
172: Of that most delicate lodging: by my life,
173: I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger
174: To feed again, though full. You do remember
175: This stain upon her?
176: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Ay, and it doth confirm
177: Another stain, as big as hell can hold,
178: Were there no more but it.
179: IACHIMO: Will you hear more?
180: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns;
181: Once, and a million!
182: IACHIMO: I'll be sworn--
183: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: No swearing.
184: If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;
185: And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny
186: Thou'st made me cuckold.
187: IACHIMO: I'll deny nothing.
188: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!
189: I will go there and do't, i' the court, before
190: Her father. I'll do something--
191: PHILARIO: Quite besides
192: The government of patience! You have won:
193: Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrath
194: He hath against himself.
195: IACHIMO: With an my heart.
ACT 2 SCENE 5

ACT 3 SCENE 1

1: CYMBELINE: Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?
2: CAIUS LUCIUS: When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet
3: Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues
4: Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain
5: And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,--
6: Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit less
7: Than in his feats deserving it--for him
8: And his succession granted Rome a tribute,
9: Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately
10: Is left untender'd.
11: QUEEN: And, to kill the marvel,
12: Shall be so ever.
13: CLOTEN: There be many Caesars,
14: Ere such another Julius. Britain is
15: A world by itself; and we will nothing pay
16: For wearing our own noses.
17: QUEEN: That opportunity
18: Which then they had to take from 's, to resume
19: We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,
20: The kings your ancestors, together with
21: The natural bravery of your isle, which stands
22: As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in
23: With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,
24: With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,
25: But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest
26: Caesar made here; but made not here his brag
27: Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--
28: That first that ever touch'd him--he was carried
29: From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping--
30: Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas,
31: Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd
32: As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof
33: The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--
34: O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,
35: Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright
36: And Britons strut with courage.
37: CLOTEN: Come, there's no more tribute to be paid: our
38: kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,
39: as I said, there is no moe such Caesars: other of
40: them may have crook'd noses, but to owe such
41: straight arms, none.
42: CYMBELINE: Son, let your mother end.
43: CLOTEN: We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as
44: Cassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have a
45: hand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? If
46: Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or
47: put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute
48: for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.
49: CYMBELINE: You must know,
50: Till the injurious Romans did extort
51: This tribute from us, we were free:
52: Caesar's ambition,
53: Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch
54: The sides o' the world, against all colour here
55: Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off
56: Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon
57: Ourselves to be.
58: Lords: We do.
59: CYMBELINE: Say, then, to Caesar,
60: Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
61: Ordain'd our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar
62: Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise
63: Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,
64: Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,
65: Who was the first of Britain which did put
66: His brows within a golden crown and call'd
67: Himself a king.
68: CAIUS LUCIUS: I am sorry, Cymbeline,
69: That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar--
70: Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than
71: Thyself domestic officers--thine enemy:
72: Receive it from me, then: war and confusion
73: In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look
74: For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,
75: I thank thee for myself.
76: CYMBELINE: Thou art welcome, Caius.
77: Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent
78: Much under him; of him I gather'd honour;
79: Which he to seek of me again, perforce,
80: Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect
81: That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
82: Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent
83: Which not to read would show the Britons cold:
84: So Caesar shall not find them.
85: CAIUS LUCIUS: Let proof speak.
86: CLOTEN: His majesty bids you welcome. Make
87: pastime with us a day or two, or longer: if
88: you seek us afterwards in other terms, you
89: shall find us in our salt-water girdle: if you
90: beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in
91: the adventure, our crows shall fare the better
92: for you; and there's an end.
93: CAIUS LUCIUS: So, sir.
94: CYMBELINE: I know your master's pleasure and he mine:
95: All the remain is 'Welcome!'
ACT 3 SCENE 2

1: PISANIO: How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not
2: What monster's her accuser? Leonatus,
3: O master! what a strange infection
4: Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,
5: As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail'd
6: On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:
7: She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,
8: More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults
9: As would take in some virtue. O my master!
10: Thy mind to her is now as low as were
11: Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?
12: Upon the love and truth and vows which I
13: Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood?
14: If it be so to do good service, never
15: Let me be counted serviceable. How look I,
16: That I should seem to lack humanity
17: so much as this fact comes to?
18: 'Do't: the letter
19: that I have sent her, by her own command
20: Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper!
21: Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,
22: Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'st
23: So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.
24: I am ignorant in what I am commanded.
25: IMOGEN: How now, Pisanio!
26: PISANIO: Madam, here is a letter from my lord.
27: IMOGEN: Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus!
28: O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer
29: That knew the stars as I his characters;
30: He'ld lay the future open. You good gods,
31: Let what is here contain'd relish of love,
32: Of my lord's health, of his content, yet not
33: That we two are asunder; let that grieve him:
34: Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,
35: For it doth physic love: of his content,
36: All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be
37: You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers
38: And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike:
39: Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet
40: You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!
41: 'Justice, and your father's wrath, should he take me
42: in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me, as
43: you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew me
44: with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria,
45: at Milford-Haven: what your own love will out of
46: this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all
47: happiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and your,
48: increasing in love,
49: LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.'
50: O, for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?
51: He is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell me
52: How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs
53: May plod it in a week, why may not I
54: Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,--
55: Who long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,--
56: let me bate,-but not like me--yet long'st,
57: But in a fainter kind:--O, not like me;
58: For mine's beyond beyond--say, and speak thick;
59: Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,
60: To the smothering of the sense--how far it is
61: To this same blessed Milford: and by the way
62: Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
63: To inherit such a haven: but first of all,
64: How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
65: That we shall make in time, from our hence-going
66: And our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence:
67: Why should excuse be born or e'er begot?
68: We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,
69: How many score of miles may we well ride
70: 'Twixt hour and hour?
71: PISANIO: One score 'twixt sun and sun,
72: Madam, 's enough for you:
73: and too much too.
74: IMOGEN: Why, one that rode to's execution, man,
75: Could never go so slow: I have heard of
76: riding wagers,
77: Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
78: That run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery:
79: Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say
80: She'll home to her father: and provide me presently
81: A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit
82: A franklin's housewife.
83: PISANIO: Madam, you're best consider.
84: IMOGEN: I see before me, man: nor here, nor here,
85: Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,
86: That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;
87: Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say,
88: Accessible is none but Milford way.
ACT 3 SCENE 3

1: BELARIUS: A goodly day not to keep house, with such
2: Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate
3: Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you
4: To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs
5: Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through
6: And keep their impious turbans on, without
7: Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!
8: We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly
9: As prouder livers do.
10: GUIDERIUS: Hail, heaven!
11: ARVIRAGUS: Hail, heaven!
12: BELARIUS: Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;
13: Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,
14: When you above perceive me like a crow,
15: That it is place which lessens and sets off;
16: And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
17: Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:
18: This service is not service, so being done,
19: But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,
20: Draws us a profit from all things we see;
21: And often, to our comfort, shall we find
22: The sharded beetle in a safer hold
23: Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life
24: Is nobler than attending for a cheque,
25: Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,
26: Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:
27: Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,
28: Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.
29: GUIDERIUS: Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,
30: Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not
31: What air's from home. Haply this life is best,
32: If quiet life be best; sweeter to you
33: That have a sharper known; well corresponding
34: With your stiff age: but unto us it is
35: A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;
36: A prison for a debtor, that not dares
37: To stride a limit.
38: ARVIRAGUS: What should we speak of
39: When we are old as you? when we shall hear
40: The rain and wind beat dark December, how,
41: In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse
42: The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;
43: We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,
44: Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;
45: Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage
46: We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,
47: And sing our bondage freely.
48: BELARIUS: How you speak!
49: Did you but know the city's usuries
50: And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court
51: As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb
52: Is certain falling, or so slippery that
53: The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,
54: A pain that only seems to seek out danger
55: I' the name of fame and honour; which dies i'
56: the search,
57: And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph
58: As record of fair act; nay, many times,
59: Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,
60: Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys, this story
61: The world may read in me: my body's mark'd
62: With Roman swords, and my report was once
63: First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,
64: And when a soldier was the theme, my name
65: Was not far off: then was I as a tree
66: Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,
67: A storm or robbery, call it what you will,
68: Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,
69: And left me bare to weather.
70: GUIDERIUS: Uncertain favour!
71: BELARIUS: My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--
72: But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd
73: Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline
74: I was confederate with the Romans: so
75: Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years
76: This rock and these demesnes have been my world;
77: Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid
78: More pious debts to heaven than in all
79: The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!
80: This is not hunters' language: he that strikes
81: The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;
82: To him the other two shall minister;
83: And we will fear no poison, which attends
84: In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.
85: How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!
86: These boys know little they are sons to the king;
87: Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.
88: They think they are mine; and though train'd
89: up thus meanly
90: I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit
91: The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them
92: In simple and low things to prince it much
93: Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,
94: The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who
95: The king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove!
96: When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
97: The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out
98: Into my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,
99: And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then
100: The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,
101: Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture
102: That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,
103: Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,
104: Strikes life into my speech and shows much more
105: His own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused!
106: O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows
107: Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,
108: At three and two years old, I stole these babes;
109: Thinking to bar thee of succession, as
110: Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,
111: Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for
112: their mother,
113: And every day do honour to her grave:
114: Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,
115: They take for natural father. The game is up.
ACT 3 SCENE 4

1: IMOGEN: Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place
2: Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so
3: To see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!
4: Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,
5: That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh
6: From the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,
7: Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
8: Beyond self-explication: put thyself
9: Into a havior of less fear, ere wildness
10: Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?
11: Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with
12: A look untender? If't be summer news,
13: Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st
14: But keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!
15: That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,
16: And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue
17: May take off some extremity, which to read
18: Would be even mortal to me.
19: PISANIO: Please you, read;
20: And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing
21: The most disdain'd of fortune.
22: IMOGEN: [Reads] 'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played the
23: strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie
24: bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,
25: but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain
26: as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,
27: must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with
28: the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away
29: her life: I shall give thee opportunity at
30: Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose
31: where, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain
32: it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour and
33: equally to me disloyal.'
34: PISANIO: What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper
35: Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,
36: Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue
37: Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
38: Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
39: All corners of the world: kings, queens and states,
40: Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave
41: This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?
42: IMOGEN: False to his bed! What is it to be false?
43: To lie in watch there and to think on him?
44: To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep
45: charge nature,
46: To break it with a fearful dream of him
47: And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?
48: PISANIO: Alas, good lady!
49: IMOGEN: I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,
50: Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;
51: Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks
52: Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy
53: Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:
54: Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;
55: And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,
56: I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O,
57: Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,
58: By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought
59: Put on for villany; not born where't grows,
60: But worn a bait for ladies.
61: PISANIO: Good madam, hear me.
62: IMOGEN: True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,
63: Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping
64: Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity
65: From most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,
66: Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;
67: Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured
68: From thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest:
69: Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,
70: A little witness my obedience: look!
71: I draw the sword myself: take it, and hit
72: The innocent mansion of my love, my heart;
73: Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;
74: Thy master is not there, who was indeed
75: The riches of it: do his bidding; strike
76: Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;
77: But now thou seem'st a coward.
78: PISANIO: Hence, vile instrument!
79: Thou shalt not damn my hand.
80: IMOGEN: Why, I must die;
81: And if I do not by thy hand, thou art
82: No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter
83: There is a prohibition so divine
84: That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.
85: Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;
86: Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?
87: The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,
88: All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,
89: Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more
90: Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools
91: Believe false teachers: though those that
92: are betray'd
93: Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor
94: Stands in worse case of woe.
95: And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up
96: My disobedience 'gainst the king my father
97: And make me put into contempt the suits
98: Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find
99: It is no act of common passage, but
100: A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself
101: To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her
102: That now thou tirest on, how thy memory
103: Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch:
104: The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?
105: Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,
106: When I desire it too.
107: PISANIO: O gracious lady,
108: Since I received command to do this business
109: I have not slept one wink.
110: IMOGEN: Do't, and to bed then.
111: PISANIO: I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.
112: IMOGEN: Wherefore then
113: Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
114: So many miles with a pretence? this place?
115: Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?
116: The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,
117: For my being absent? whereunto I never
118: Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,
119: To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,
120: The elected deer before thee?
121: PISANIO: But to win time
122: To lose so bad employment; in the which
123: I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,
124: Hear me with patience.
125: IMOGEN: Talk thy tongue weary; speak
126: I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear
127: Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,
128: Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.
129: PISANIO: Then, madam,
130: I thought you would not back again.
131: IMOGEN: Most like;
132: Bringing me here to kill me.
133: PISANIO: Not so, neither:
134: But if I were as wise as honest, then
135: My purpose would prove well. It cannot be
136: But that my master is abused:
137: Some villain, ay, and singular in his art.
138: Hath done you both this cursed injury.
139: IMOGEN: Some Roman courtezan.
140: PISANIO: No, on my life.
141: I'll give but notice you are dead and send him
142: Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded
143: I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,
144: And that will well confirm it.
145: IMOGEN: Why good fellow,
146: What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?
147: Or in my life what comfort, when I am
148: Dead to my husband?
149: PISANIO: If you'll back to the court--
150: IMOGEN: No court, no father; nor no more ado
151: With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,
152: That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me
153: As fearful as a siege.
154: PISANIO: If not at court,
155: Then not in Britain must you bide.
156: IMOGEN: Where then
157: Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,
158: Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume
159: Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;
160: In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think
161: There's livers out of Britain.
162: PISANIO: I am most glad
163: You think of other place. The ambassador,
164: Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven
165: To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind
166: Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
167: That which, to appear itself, must not yet be
168: But by self-danger, you should tread a course
169: Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near
170: The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least
171: That though his actions were not visible, yet
172: Report should render him hourly to your ear
173: As truly as he moves.
174: IMOGEN: O, for such means!
175: Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,
176: I would adventure.
177: PISANIO: Well, then, here's the point:
178: You must forget to be a woman; change
179: Command into obedience: fear and niceness--
180: The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,
181: Woman its pretty self--into a waggish courage:
182: Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy and
183: As quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you must
184: Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,
185: Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
186: Alack, no remedy!--to the greedy touch
187: Of common-kissing Titan, and forget
188: Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein
189: You made great Juno angry.
190: IMOGEN: Nay, be brief
191: I see into thy end, and am almost
192: A man already.
193: PISANIO: First, make yourself but like one.
194: Fore-thinking this, I have already fit--
195: 'Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet, hat, hose, all
196: That answer to them: would you in their serving,
197: And with what imitation you can borrow
198: From youth of such a season, 'fore noble Lucius
199: Present yourself, desire his service, tell him
200: wherein you're happy,--which you'll make him know,
201: If that his head have ear in music,--doubtless
202: With joy he will embrace you, for he's honourable
203: And doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad,
204: You have me, rich; and I will never fail
205: Beginning nor supplyment.
206: IMOGEN: Thou art all the comfort
207: The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:
208: There's more to be consider'd; but we'll even
209: All that good time will give us: this attempt
210: I am soldier to, and will abide it with
211: A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.
212: PISANIO: Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,
213: Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of
214: Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,
215: Here is a box; I had it from the queen:
216: What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea,
217: Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this
218: Will drive away distemper. To some shade,
219: And fit you to your manhood. May the gods
220: Direct you to the best!
221: IMOGEN: Amen: I thank thee.
ACT 3 SCENE 5

1: CYMBELINE: Thus far; and so farewell.
2: CAIUS LUCIUS: Thanks, royal sir.
3: My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence;
4: And am right sorry that I must report ye
5: My master's enemy.
6: CYMBELINE: Our subjects, sir,
7: Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself
8: To show less sovereignty than they, must needs
9: Appear unkinglike.
10: CAIUS LUCIUS: So, sir: I desire of you
11: A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven.
12: Madam, all joy befal your grace!
13: QUEEN: And you!
14: CYMBELINE: My lords, you are appointed for that office;
15: The due of honour in no point omit.
16: So farewell, noble Lucius.
17: CAIUS LUCIUS: Your hand, my lord.
18: CLOTEN: Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
19: I wear it as your enemy.
20: CAIUS LUCIUS: Sir, the event
21: Is yet to name the winner: fare you well.
22: CYMBELINE: Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,
23: Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!
24: QUEEN: He goes hence frowning: but it honours us
25: That we have given him cause.
26: CLOTEN: 'Tis all the better;
27: Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.
28: CYMBELINE: Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor
29: How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely
30: Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness:
31: The powers that he already hath in Gallia
32: Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves
33: His war for Britain.
34: QUEEN: 'Tis not sleepy business;
35: But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.
36: CYMBELINE: Our expectation that it would be thus
37: Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,
38: Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd
39: Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd
40: The duty of the day: she looks us like
41: A thing more made of malice than of duty:
42: We have noted it. Call her before us; for
43: We have been too slight in sufferance.
44: QUEEN: Royal sir,
45: Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired
46: Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,
47: 'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,
48: Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a lady
49: So tender of rebukes that words are strokes
50: And strokes death to her.
51: CYMBELINE: Where is she, sir? How
52: Can her contempt be answer'd?
53: Attendant: Please you, sir,
54: Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answer
55: That will be given to the loudest noise we make.
56: QUEEN: My lord, when last I went to visit her,
57: She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,
58: Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,
59: She should that duty leave unpaid to you,
60: Which daily she was bound to proffer: this
61: She wish'd me to make known; but our great court
62: Made me to blame in memory.
63: CYMBELINE: Her doors lock'd?
64: Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear
65: Prove false!
66: QUEEN: Son, I say, follow the king.
67: CLOTEN: That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,
68: have not seen these two days.
69: QUEEN: Go, look after.
70: Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!
71: He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence
72: Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes
73: It is a thing most precious. But for her,
74: Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her,
75: Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown
76: To her desired Posthumus: gone she is
77: To death or to dishonour; and my end
78: Can make good use of either: she being down,
79: I have the placing of the British crown.
80: How now, my son!
81: CLOTEN: 'Tis certain she is fled.
82: Go in and cheer the king: he rages; none
83: Dare come about him.
84: QUEEN: [Aside] All the better: may
85: This night forestall him of the coming day!
86: CLOTEN: I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal,
87: And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
88: Than lady, ladies, woman; from every one
89: The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,
90: Outsells them all; I love her therefore: but
91: Disdaining me and throwing favours on
92: The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment
93: That what's else rare is choked; and in that point
94: I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,
95: To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall--
96: Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?
97: Come hither: ah, you precious pander! Villain,
98: Where is thy lady? In a word; or else
99: Thou art straightway with the fiends.
100: PISANIO: O, good my lord!
101: CLOTEN: Where is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter,--
102: I will not ask again. Close villain,
103: I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip
104: Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?
105: From whose so many weights of baseness cannot
106: A dram of worth be drawn.
107: PISANIO: Alas, my lord,
108: How can she be with him? When was she missed?
109: He is in Rome.
110: CLOTEN: Where is she, sir? Come nearer;
111: No further halting: satisfy me home
112: What is become of her.
113: PISANIO: O, my all-worthy lord!
114: CLOTEN: All-worthy villain!
115: Discover where thy mistress is at once,
116: At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!'
117: Speak, or thy silence on the instant is
118: Thy condemnation and thy death.
119: PISANIO: Then, sir,
120: This paper is the history of my knowledge
121: Touching her flight.
122: CLOTEN: Let's see't. I will pursue her
123: Even to Augustus' throne.
124: PISANIO: [Aside] Or this, or perish.
125: She's far enough; and what he learns by this
126: May prove his travel, not her danger.
127: CLOTEN: Hum!
128: PISANIO: [Aside] I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,
129: Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!
130: CLOTEN: Sirrah, is this letter true?
131: PISANIO: Sir, as I think.
132: CLOTEN: It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thou
133: wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,
134: undergo those employments wherein I should have
135: cause to use thee with a serious industry, that is,
136: what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform it
137: directly and truly, I would think thee an honest
138: man: thou shouldst neither want my means for thy
139: relief nor my voice for thy preferment.
140: PISANIO: Well, my good lord.
141: CLOTEN: Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently and
142: constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of
143: that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the
144: course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of
145: mine: wilt thou serve me?
146: PISANIO: Sir, I will.
147: CLOTEN: Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thy
148: late master's garments in thy possession?
149: PISANIO: I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he
150: wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.
151: CLOTEN: The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit
152: hither: let it be thy lint service; go.
153: PISANIO: I shall, my lord.
154: CLOTEN: Meet thee at Milford-Haven!--I forgot to ask him one
155: thing; I'll remember't anon:--even there, thou
156: villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these
157: garments were come. She said upon a time--the
158: bitterness of it I now belch from my heart--that she
159: held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect
160: than my noble and natural person together with the
161: adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my
162: back, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in her
163: eyes; there shall she see my valour, which will then
164: be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my
165: speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and
166: when my lust hath dined,--which, as I say, to vex
167: her I will execute in the clothes that she so
168: praised,--to the court I'll knock her back, foot
169: her home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly,
170: and I'll be merry in my revenge.
171: Be those the garments?
172: PISANIO: Ay, my noble lord.
173: CLOTEN: How long is't since she went to Milford-Haven?
174: PISANIO: She can scarce be there yet.
175: CLOTEN: Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second
176: thing that I have commanded thee: the third is,
177: that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be
178: but duteous, and true preferment shall tender itself
179: to thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I had
180: wings to follow it! Come, and be true.
181: PISANIO: Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee
182: Were to prove false, which I will never be,
183: To him that is most true. To Milford go,
184: And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,
185: You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed
186: Be cross'd with slowness; labour be his meed!
ACT 3 SCENE 6

1: IMOGEN: I see a man's life is a tedious one:
2: I have tired myself, and for two nights together
3: Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick,
4: But that my resolution helps me. Milford,
5: When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,
6: Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think
7: Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,
8: Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told me
9: I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,
10: That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis
11: A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,
12: When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness
13: Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood
14: Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!
15: Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,
16: My hunger's gone; but even before, I was
17: At point to sink for food. But what is this?
18: Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:
19: I were best not to call; I dare not call:
20: yet famine,
21: Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant,
22: Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever
23: Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?
24: If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage,
25: Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.
26: Best draw my sword: and if mine enemy
27: But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't.
28: Such a foe, good heavens!
29: BELARIUS: You, Polydote, have proved best woodman and
30: Are master of the feast: Cadwal and I
31: Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match:
32: The sweat of industry would dry and die,
33: But for the end it works to. Come; our stomachs
34: Will make what's homely savoury: weariness
35: Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth
36: Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,
37: Poor house, that keep'st thyself!
38: GUIDERIUS: I am thoroughly weary.
39: ARVIRAGUS: I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.
40: GUIDERIUS: There is cold meat i' the cave; we'll browse on that,
41: Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.
42: BELARIUS: [Looking into the cave]
43: Stay; come not in.
44: But that it eats our victuals, I should think
45: Here were a fairy.
46: GUIDERIUS: What's the matter, sir?
47: BELARIUS: By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,
48: An earthly paragon! Behold divineness
49: No elder than a boy!
50: IMOGEN: Good masters, harm me not:
51: Before I enter'd here, I call'd; and thought
52: To have begg'd or bought what I have took:
53: good troth,
54: I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had found
55: Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat:
56: I would have left it on the board so soon
57: As I had made my meal, and parted
58: With prayers for the provider.
59: GUIDERIUS: Money, youth?
60: ARVIRAGUS: All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!
61: As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of those
62: Who worship dirty gods.
63: IMOGEN: I see you're angry:
64: Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should
65: Have died had I not made it.
66: BELARIUS: Whither bound?
67: IMOGEN: To Milford-Haven.
68: BELARIUS: What's your name?
69: IMOGEN: Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who
70: Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;
71: To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,
72: I am fall'n in this offence.
73: BELARIUS: Prithee, fair youth,
74: Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds
75: By this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd!
76: 'Tis almost night: you shall have better cheer
77: Ere you depart: and thanks to stay and eat it.
78: Boys, bid him welcome.
79: GUIDERIUS: Were you a woman, youth,
80: I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty,
81: I bid for you as I'd buy.
82: ARVIRAGUS: I'll make't my comfort
83: He is a man; I'll love him as my brother:
84: And such a welcome as I'd give to him
85: After long absence, such is yours: most welcome!
86: Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.
87: IMOGEN: 'Mongst friends,
88: If brothers.
89: Would it had been so, that they
90: Had been my father's sons! then had my prize
91: Been less, and so more equal ballasting
92: To thee, Posthumus.
93: BELARIUS: He wrings at some distress.
94: GUIDERIUS: Would I could free't!
95: ARVIRAGUS: Or I, whate'er it be,
96: What pain it cost, what danger. God's!
97: BELARIUS: Hark, boys.
98: IMOGEN: Great men,
99: That had a court no bigger than this cave,
100: That did attend themselves and had the virtue
101: Which their own conscience seal'd them--laying by
102: That nothing-gift of differing multitudes--
103: Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!
104: I'd change my sex to be companion with them,
105: Since Leonatus's false.
106: BELARIUS: It shall be so.
107: Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in:
108: Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp'd,
109: We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story,
110: So far as thou wilt speak it.
111: GUIDERIUS: Pray, draw near.
112: ARVIRAGUS: The night to the owl and morn to the lark
113: less welcome.
114: IMOGEN: Thanks, sir.
115: ARVIRAGUS: I pray, draw near.
ACT 3 SCENE 7

1: First Senator: This is the tenor of the emperor's writ:
2: That since the common men are now in action
3: 'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,
4: And that the legions now in Gallia are
5: Full weak to undertake our wars against
6: The fall'n-off Britons, that we do incite
7: The gentry to this business. He creates
8: Lucius preconsul: and to you the tribunes,
9: For this immediate levy, he commends
10: His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!
11: First Tribune: Is Lucius general of the forces?
12: Second Senator: Ay.
13: First Tribune: Remaining now in Gallia?
14: First Senator: With those legions
15: Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy
16: Must be supplyant: the words of your commission
17: Will tie you to the numbers and the time
18: Of their dispatch.
ACT 4 SCENE 1

1: CLOTEN: I am near to the place where they should meet, if
2: Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments
3: serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by
4: him that made the tailor, not be fit too? the
5: rather--saving reverence of the word--for 'tis said
6: a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must
7: play the workman. I dare speak it to myself--for it
8: is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer
9: in his own chamber--I mean, the lines of my body are
10: as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong,
11: not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the
12: advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike
13: conversant in general services, and more remarkable
14: in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant
15: thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!
16: Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy
17: shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy
18: mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before
19: thy face: and all this done, spurn her home to her
20: father; who may haply be a little angry for my so
21: rough usage; but my mother, having power of his
22: testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My
23: horse is tied up safe: out, sword, and to a sore
24: purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand! This is
25: the very description of their meeting-place; and
26: the fellow dares not deceive me.
ACT 4 SCENE 2

1: BELARIUS: [To IMOGEN] You are not well: remain here in the cave;
2: We'll come to you after hunting.
3: ARVIRAGUS: [To IMOGEN] Brother, stay here
4: Are we not brothers?
5: IMOGEN: So man and man should be;
6: But clay and clay differs in dignity,
7: Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.
8: GUIDERIUS: Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.
9: IMOGEN: So sick I am not, yet I am not well;
10: But not so citizen a wanton as
11: To seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me;
12: Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom
13: Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me
14: Cannot amend me; society is no comfort
15: To one not sociable: I am not very sick,
16: Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here:
17: I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,
18: Stealing so poorly.
19: GUIDERIUS: I love thee; I have spoke it
20: How much the quantity, the weight as much,
21: As I do love my father.
22: BELARIUS: What! how! how!
23: ARVIRAGUS: If it be sin to say so, I yoke me
24: In my good brother's fault: I know not why
25: I love this youth; and I have heard you say,
26: Love's reason's without reason: the bier at door,
27: And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say
28: 'My father, not this youth.'
29: BELARIUS: [Aside] O noble strain!
30: O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!
31: Cowards father cowards and base things sire base:
32: Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.
33: I'm not their father; yet who this should be,
34: Doth miracle itself, loved before me.
35: 'Tis the ninth hour o' the morn.
36: ARVIRAGUS: Brother, farewell.
37: IMOGEN: I wish ye sport.
38: ARVIRAGUS: You health. So please you, sir.
39: IMOGEN: [Aside] These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies
40: I have heard!
41: Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:
42: Experience, O, thou disprovest report!
43: The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dish
44: Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.
45: I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,
46: I'll now taste of thy drug.
47: GUIDERIUS: I could not stir him:
48: He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;
49: Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.
50: ARVIRAGUS: Thus did he answer me: yet said, hereafter
51: I might know more.
52: BELARIUS: To the field, to the field!
53: We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest.
54: ARVIRAGUS: We'll not be long away.
55: BELARIUS: Pray, be not sick,
56: For you must be our housewife.
57: IMOGEN: Well or ill,
58: I am bound to you.
59: BELARIUS: And shalt be ever.
60: This youth, how'er distress'd, appears he hath had
61: Good ancestors.
62: ARVIRAGUS: How angel-like he sings!
63: GUIDERIUS: But his neat cookery! he cut our roots
64: In characters,
65: And sauced our broths, as Juno had been sick
66: And he her dieter.
67: ARVIRAGUS: Nobly he yokes
68: A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
69: Was that it was, for not being such a smile;
70: The smile mocking the sigh, that it would fly
71: From so divine a temple, to commix
72: With winds that sailors rail at.
73: GUIDERIUS: I do note
74: That grief and patience, rooted in him both,
75: Mingle their spurs together.
76: ARVIRAGUS: Grow, patience!
77: And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine
78: His perishing root with the increasing vine!
79: BELARIUS: It is great morning. Come, away!--
80: Who's there?
81: CLOTEN: I cannot find those runagates; that villain
82: Hath mock'd me. I am faint.
83: BELARIUS: 'Those runagates!'
84: Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tis
85: Cloten, the son o' the queen. I fear some ambush.
86: I saw him not these many years, and yet
87: I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws: hence!
88: GUIDERIUS: He is but one: you and my brother search
89: What companies are near: pray you, away;
90: Let me alone with him.
91: CLOTEN: Soft! What are you
92: That fly me thus? some villain mountaineers?
93: I have heard of such. What slave art thou?
94: GUIDERIUS: A thing
95: More slavish did I ne'er than answering
96: A slave without a knock.
97: CLOTEN: Thou art a robber,
98: A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief.
99: GUIDERIUS: To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not I
100: An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?
101: Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not
102: My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,
103: Why I should yield to thee?
104: CLOTEN: Thou villain base,
105: Know'st me not by my clothes?
106: GUIDERIUS: No, nor thy tailor, rascal,
107: Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,
108: Which, as it seems, make thee.
109: CLOTEN: Thou precious varlet,
110: My tailor made them not.
111: GUIDERIUS: Hence, then, and thank
112: The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;
113: I am loath to beat thee.
114: CLOTEN: Thou injurious thief,
115: Hear but my name, and tremble.
116: GUIDERIUS: What's thy name?
117: CLOTEN: Cloten, thou villain.
118: GUIDERIUS: Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,
119: I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad, or
120: Adder, Spider,
121: 'Twould move me sooner.
122: CLOTEN: To thy further fear,
123: Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know
124: I am son to the queen.
125: GUIDERIUS: I am sorry for 't; not seeming
126: So worthy as thy birth.
127: CLOTEN: Art not afeard?
128: GUIDERIUS: Those that I reverence those I fear, the wise:
129: At fools I laugh, not fear them.
130: CLOTEN: Die the death:
131: When I have slain thee with my proper hand,
132: I'll follow those that even now fled hence,
133: And on the gates of Lud's-town set your heads:
134: Yield, rustic mountaineer.
135: BELARIUS: No companies abroad?
136: ARVIRAGUS: None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.
137: BELARIUS: I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,
138: But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour
139: Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice,
140: And burst of speaking, were as his: I am absolute
141: 'Twas very Cloten.
142: ARVIRAGUS: In this place we left them:
143: I wish my brother make good time with him,
144: You say he is so fell.
145: BELARIUS: Being scarce made up,
146: I mean, to man, he had not apprehension
147: Of roaring terrors; for the effect of judgment
148: Is oft the cause of fear. But, see, thy brother.
149: GUIDERIUS: This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;
150: There was no money in't: not Hercules
151: Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none:
152: Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
153: My head as I do his.
154: BELARIUS: What hast thou done?
155: GUIDERIUS: I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,
156: Son to the queen, after his own report;
157: Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore
158: With his own single hand he'ld take us in
159: Displace our heads where--thank the gods!--they grow,
160: And set them on Lud's-town.
161: BELARIUS: We are all undone.
162: GUIDERIUS: Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,
163: But that he swore to take, our lives? The law
164: Protects not us: then why should we be tender
165: To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,
166: Play judge and executioner all himself,
167: For we do fear the law? What company
168: Discover you abroad?
169: BELARIUS: No single soul
170: Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason
171: He must have some attendants. Though his humour
172: Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that
173: From one bad thing to worse; not frenzy, not
174: Absolute madness could so far have raved
175: To bring him here alone; although perhaps
176: It may be heard at court that such as we
177: Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time
178: May make some stronger head; the which he hearing--
179: As it is like him--might break out, and swear
180: He'ld fetch us in; yet is't not probable
181: To come alone, either he so undertaking,
182: Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear,
183: If we do fear this body hath a tail
184: More perilous than the head.
185: ARVIRAGUS: Let ordinance
186: Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,
187: My brother hath done well.
188: BELARIUS: I had no mind
189: To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness
190: Did make my way long forth.
191: GUIDERIUS: With his own sword,
192: Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en
193: His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek
194: Behind our rock; and let it to the sea,
195: And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:
196: That's all I reck.
197: BELARIUS: I fear 'twill be revenged:
198: Would, Polydote, thou hadst not done't! though valour
199: Becomes thee well enough.
200: ARVIRAGUS: Would I had done't
201: So the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore,
202: I love thee brotherly, but envy much
203: Thou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges,
204: That possible strength might meet, would seek us through
205: And put us to our answer.
206: BELARIUS: Well, 'tis done:
207: We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger
208: Where there's no profit. I prithee, to our rock;
209: You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stay
210: Till hasty Polydote return, and bring him
211: To dinner presently.
212: ARVIRAGUS: Poor sick Fidele!
213: I'll weringly to him: to gain his colour
214: I'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood,
215: And praise myself for charity.
216: BELARIUS: O thou goddess,
217: Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st
218: In these two princely boys! They are as gentle
219: As zephyrs blowing below the violet,
220: Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,
221: Their royal blood enchafed, as the rudest wind,
222: That by the top doth take the mountain pine,
223: And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonder
224: That an invisible instinct should frame them
225: To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,
226: Civility not seen from other, valour
227: That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop
228: As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange
229: What Cloten's being here to us portends,
230: Or what his death will bring us.
231: GUIDERIUS: Where's my brother?
232: I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,
233: In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage
234: For his return.
235: BELARIUS: My ingenious instrument!
236: Hark, Polydore, it sounds! But what occasion
237: Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!
238: GUIDERIUS: Is he at home?
239: BELARIUS: He went hence even now.
240: GUIDERIUS: What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother
241: it did not speak before. All solemn things
242: Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?
243: Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
244: Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
245: Is Cadwal mad?
246: BELARIUS: Look, here he comes,
247: And brings the dire occasion in his arms
248: Of what we blame him for.
249: ARVIRAGUS: The bird is dead
250: That we have made so much on. I had rather
251: Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,
252: To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,
253: Than have seen this.
254: GUIDERIUS: O sweetest, fairest lily!
255: My brother wears thee not the one half so well
256: As when thou grew'st thyself.
257: BELARIUS: O melancholy!
258: Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find
259: The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare
260: Might easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!
261: Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,
262: Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.
263: How found you him?
264: ARVIRAGUS: Stark, as you see:
265: Thus smiling, as some fly hid tickled slumber,
266: Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; his
267: right cheek
268: Reposing on a cushion.
269: GUIDERIUS: Where?
270: ARVIRAGUS: O' the floor;
271: His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept, and put
272: My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness
273: Answer'd my steps too loud.
274: GUIDERIUS: Why, he but sleeps:
275: If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed;
276: With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,
277: And worms will not come to thee.
278: ARVIRAGUS: With fairest flowers
279: Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,
280: I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack
281: The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor
282: The azured harebell, like thy veins, no, nor
283: The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,
284: Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,
285: With charitable bill,--O bill, sore-shaming
286: Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie
287: Without a monument!--bring thee all this;
288: Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,
289: To winter-ground thy corse.
290: GUIDERIUS: Prithee, have done;
291: And do not play in wench-like words with that
292: Which is so serious. Let us bury him,
293: And not protract with admiration what
294: Is now due debt. To the grave!
295: ARVIRAGUS: Say, where shall's lay him?
296: GUIDERIUS: By good Euriphile, our mother.
297: ARVIRAGUS: Be't so:
298: And let us, Polydore, though now our voices
299: Have got the mannish crack, sing him to the ground,
300: As once our mother; use like note and words,
301: Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.
302: GUIDERIUS: Cadwal,
303: I cannot sing: I'll weep, and word it with thee;
304: For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
305: Than priests and fanes that lie.
306: ARVIRAGUS: We'll speak it, then.
307: BELARIUS: Great griefs, I see, medicine the less; for Cloten
308: Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;
309: And though he came our enemy, remember
310: He was paid for that: though mean and
311: mighty, rotting
312: Together, have one dust, yet reverence,
313: That angel of the world, doth make distinction
314: Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely
315: And though you took his life, as being our foe,
316: Yet bury him as a prince.
317: GUIDERIUS: Pray You, fetch him hither.
318: Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',
319: When neither are alive.
320: ARVIRAGUS: If you'll go fetch him,
321: We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.
322: GUIDERIUS: Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east;
323: My father hath a reason for't.
324: ARVIRAGUS: 'Tis true.
325: GUIDERIUS: Come on then, and remove him.
326: ARVIRAGUS: So. Begin.
327: GUIDERIUS: Fear no more the heat o' the sun,
328: Nor the furious winter's rages;
329: Thou thy worldly task hast done,
330: Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:
331: Golden lads and girls all must,
332: As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.
333: ARVIRAGUS: Fear no more the frown o' the great;
334: Thou art past the tyrant's stroke;
335: Care no more to clothe and eat;
336: To thee the reed is as the oak:
337: The sceptre, learning, physic, must
338: All follow this, and come to dust.
339: GUIDERIUS: Fear no more the lightning flash,
340: ARVIRAGUS: Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;
341: GUIDERIUS: Fear not slander, censure rash;
342: ARVIRAGUS: Thou hast finish'd joy and moan:
343: All lovers young, all lovers must
344: Consign to thee, and come to dust.
345: GUIDERIUS: No exorciser harm thee!
346: ARVIRAGUS: Nor no witchcraft charm thee!
347: GUIDERIUS: Ghost unlaid forbear thee!
348: ARVIRAGUS: Nothing ill come near thee!
349: Quiet consummation have;
350: And renowned be thy grave!
351: GUIDERIUS: We have done our obsequies: come, lay him down.
352: BELARIUS: Here's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight, more:
353: The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night
354: Are strewings fitt'st for graves. Upon their faces.
355: You were as flowers, now wither'd: even so
356: These herblets shall, which we upon you strew.
357: Come on, away: apart upon our knees.
358: The ground that gave them first has them again:
359: Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.
360: IMOGEN: [Awaking] Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven; which is
361: the way?--
362: I thank you.--By yond bush?--Pray, how far thither?
363: 'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?--
364: I have gone all night. 'Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.
365: But, soft! no bedfellow!--O god s and goddesses!
366: These flowers are like the pleasures of the world;
367: This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream;
368: For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,
369: And cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so;
370: 'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
371: Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyes
372: Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,
373: I tremble stiff with fear: but if there be
374: Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
375: As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!
376: The dream's here still: even when I wake, it is
377: Without me, as within me; not imagined, felt.
378: A headless man! The garments of Posthumus!
379: I know the shape of's leg: this is his hand;
380: His foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh;
381: The brawns of Hercules: but his Jovial face
382: Murder in heaven?--How!--'Tis gone. Pisanio,
383: All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,
384: And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,
385: Conspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten,
386: Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read
387: Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio
388: Hath with his forged letters,--damn'd Pisanio--
389: From this most bravest vessel of the world
390: Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas,
391: Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me!
392: where's that?
393: Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,
394: And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?
395: 'Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them
396: Have laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!
397: The drug he gave me, which he said was precious
398: And cordial to me, have I not found it
399: Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home:
400: This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O!
401: Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,
402: That we the horrider may seem to those
403: Which chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord!
404: Captain: To them the legions garrison'd in Gailia,
405: After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending
406: You here at Milford-Haven with your ships:
407: They are in readiness.
408: CAIUS LUCIUS: But what from Rome?
409: Captain: The senate hath stirr'd up the confiners
410: And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,
411: That promise noble service: and they come
412: Under the conduct of bold Iachimo,
413: Syenna's brother.
414: CAIUS LUCIUS: When expect you them?
415: Captain: With the next benefit o' the wind.
416: CAIUS LUCIUS: This forwardness
417: Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers
418: Be muster'd; bid the captains look to't. Now, sir,
419: What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?
420: Soothsayer: Last night the very gods show'd me a vision--
421: I fast and pray'd for their intelligence--thus:
422: I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd
423: From the spongy south to this part of the west,
424: There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--
425: Unless my sins abuse my divination--
426: Success to the Roman host.
427: CAIUS LUCIUS: Dream often so,
428: And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here
429: Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime
430: It was a worthy building. How! a page!
431: Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather;
432: For nature doth abhor to make his bed
433: With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead.
434: Let's see the boy's face.
435: Captain: He's alive, my lord.
436: CAIUS LUCIUS: He'll then instruct us of this body. Young one,
437: Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems
438: They crave to be demanded. Who is this
439: Thou makest thy bloody pillow? Or who was he
440: That, otherwise than noble nature did,
441: Hath alter'd that good picture? What's thy interest
442: In this sad wreck? How came it? Who is it?
443: What art thou?
444: IMOGEN: I am nothing: or if not,
445: Nothing to be were better. This was my master,
446: A very valiant Briton and a good,
447: That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!
448: There is no more such masters: I may wander
449: From east to occident, cry out for service,
450: Try many, all good, serve truly, never
451: Find such another master.
452: CAIUS LUCIUS: 'Lack, good youth!
453: Thou movest no less with thy complaining than
454: Thy master in bleeding: say his name, good friend.
455: IMOGEN: Richard du Champ.
456: If I do lie and do
457: No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
458: They'll pardon it.--Say you, sir?
459: CAIUS LUCIUS: Thy name?
460: IMOGEN: Fidele, sir.
461: CAIUS LUCIUS: Thou dost approve thyself the very same:
462: Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.
463: Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say
464: Thou shalt be so well master'd, but, be sure,
465: No less beloved. The Roman emperor's letters,
466: Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner
467: Than thine own worth prefer thee: go with me.
468: IMOGEN: I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods,
469: I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep
470: As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when
471: With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave,
472: And on it said a century of prayers,
473: Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;
474: And leaving so his service, follow you,
475: So please you entertain me.
476: CAIUS LUCIUS: Ay, good youth!
477: And rather father thee than master thee.
478: My friends,
479: The boy hath taught us manly duties: let us
480: Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,
481: And make him with our pikes and partisans
482: A grave: come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd
483: By thee to us, and he shall be interr'd
484: As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes
485: Some falls are means the happier to arise.
ACT 4 SCENE 3

1: CYMBELINE: Again; and bring me word how 'tis with her.
2: A fever with the absence of her son,
3: A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,
4: How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,
5: The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen
6: Upon a desperate bed, and in a time
7: When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,
8: So needful for this present: it strikes me, past
9: The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,
10: Who needs must know of her departure and
11: Dost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from thee
12: By a sharp torture.
13: PISANIO: Sir, my life is yours;
14: I humbly set it at your will; but, for my mistress,
15: I nothing know where she remains, why gone,
16: Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your highness,
17: Hold me your loyal servant.
18: First Lord: Good my liege,
19: The day that she was missing he was here:
20: I dare be bound he's true and shall perform
21: All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,
22: There wants no diligence in seeking him,
23: And will, no doubt, be found.
24: CYMBELINE: The time is troublesome.
25: We'll slip you for a season; but our jealousy
26: Does yet depend.
27: First Lord: So please your majesty,
28: The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
29: Are landed on your coast, with a supply
30: Of Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.
31: CYMBELINE: Now for the counsel of my son and queen!
32: I am amazed with matter.
33: First Lord: Good my liege,
34: Your preparation can affront no less
35: Than what you hear of: come more, for more
36: you're ready:
37: The want is but to put those powers in motion
38: That long to move.
39: CYMBELINE: I thank you. Let's withdraw;
40: And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not
41: What can from Italy annoy us; but
42: We grieve at chances here. Away!
43: PISANIO: I heard no letter from my master since
44: I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:
45: Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise
46: To yield me often tidings: neither know I
47: What is betid to Cloten; but remain
48: Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.
49: Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.
50: These present wars shall find I love my country,
51: Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them.
52: All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:
53: Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.
ACT 4 SCENE 4

1: GUIDERIUS: The noise is round about us.
2: BELARIUS: Let us from it.
3: ARVIRAGUS: What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it
4: From action and adventure?
5: GUIDERIUS: Nay, what hope
6: Have we in hiding us? This way, the Romans
7: Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us
8: For barbarous and unnatural revolts
9: During their use, and slay us after.
10: BELARIUS: Sons,
11: We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us.
12: To the king's party there's no going: newness
13: Of Cloten's death--we being not known, not muster'd
14: Among the bands--may drive us to a render
15: Where we have lived, and so extort from's that
16: Which we have done, whose answer would be death
17: Drawn on with torture.
18: GUIDERIUS: This is, sir, a doubt
19: In such a time nothing becoming you,
20: Nor satisfying us.
21: ARVIRAGUS: It is not likely
22: That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,
23: Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes
24: And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,
25: That they will waste their time upon our note,
26: To know from whence we are.
27: BELARIUS: O, I am known
28: Of many in the army: many years,
29: Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him
30: From my remembrance. And, besides, the king
31: Hath not deserved my service nor your loves;
32: Who find in my exile the want of breeding,
33: The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless
34: To have the courtesy your cradle promised,
35: But to be still hot summer's tamings and
36: The shrinking slaves of winter.
37: GUIDERIUS: Than be so
38: Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army:
39: I and my brother are not known; yourself
40: So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,
41: Cannot be question'd.
42: ARVIRAGUS: By this sun that shines,
43: I'll thither: what thing is it that I never
44: Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,
45: But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!
46: Never bestrid a horse, save one that had
47: A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel
48: Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed
49: To look upon the holy sun, to have
50: The benefit of his blest beams, remaining
51: So long a poor unknown.
52: GUIDERIUS: By heavens, I'll go:
53: If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,
54: I'll take the better care, but if you will not,
55: The hazard therefore due fall on me by
56: The hands of Romans!
57: ARVIRAGUS: So say I amen.
ACT 5 SCENE 1

1: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd
2: Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,
3: If each of you should take this course, how many
4: Must murder wives much better than themselves
5: For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!
6: Every good servant does not all commands:
7: No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you
8: Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never
9: Had lived to put on this: so had you saved
10: The noble Imogen to repent, and struck
11: Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,
12: You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,
13: To have them fall no more: you some permit
14: To second ills with ills, each elder worse,
15: And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.
16: But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,
17: And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither
18: Among the Italian gentry, and to fight
19: Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough
20: That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!
21: I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,
22: Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me
23: Of these Italian weeds and suit myself
24: As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight
25: Against the part I come with; so I'll die
26: For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life
27: Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,
28: Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril
29: Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know
30: More valour in me than my habits show.
31: Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!
32: To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin
33: The fashion, less without and more within.
ACT 5 SCENE 2

1: IACHIMO: The heaviness and guilt within my bosom
2: Takes off my manhood: I have belied a lady,
3: The princess of this country, and the air on't
4: Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,
5: A very drudge of nature's, have subdued me
6: In my profession? Knighthoods and honours, borne
7: As I wear mine, are titles but of scorn.
8: If that thy gentry, Britain, go before
9: This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds
10: Is that we scarce are men and you are gods.
11: BELARIUS: Stand, stand! We have the advantage of the ground;
12: The lane is guarded: nothing routs us but
13: The villany of our fears.
14: ARVIRAGUS: Stand, stand, and fight!
15: CAIUS LUCIUS: Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself;
16: For friends kill friends, and the disorder's such
17: As war were hoodwink'd.
18: IACHIMO: 'Tis their fresh supplies.
19: CAIUS LUCIUS: It is a day turn'd strangely: or betimes
20: Let's reinforce, or fly.
ACT 5 SCENE 3

1: Lord: Camest thou from where they made the stand?
2: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: I did.
3: Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.
4: Lord: I did.
5: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,
6: But that the heavens fought: the king himself
7: Of his wings destitute, the army broken,
8: And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying
9: Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted,
10: Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work
11: More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down
12: Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling
13: Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'd
14: With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living
15: To die with lengthen'd shame.
16: Lord: Where was this lane?
17: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;
18: Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,
19: An honest one, I warrant; who deserved
20: So long a breeding as his white beard came to,
21: In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,
22: He, with two striplings-lads more like to run
23: The country base than to commit such slaughter
24: With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer
25: Than those for preservation cased, or shame--
26: Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,
27: 'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:
28: To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;
29: Or we are Romans and will give you that
30: Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,
31: But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'
32: These three,
33: Three thousand confident, in act as many--
34: For three performers are the file when all
35: The rest do nothing--with this word 'Stand, stand,'
36: Accommodated by the place, more charming
37: With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd
38: A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,
39: Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some,
40: turn'd coward
41: But by example--O, a sin in war,
42: Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look
43: The way that they did, and to grin like lions
44: Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began
45: A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon
46: A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly
47: Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,
48: The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,
49: Like fragments in hard voyages, became
50: The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open
51: Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!
52: Some slain before; some dying; some their friends
53: O'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,
54: Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:
55: Those that would die or ere resist are grown
56: The mortal bugs o' the field.
57: Lord: This was strange chance
58: A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.
59: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made
60: Rather to wonder at the things you hear
61: Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,
62: And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:
63: 'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,
64: Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'
65: Lord: Nay, be not angry, sir.
66: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: 'Lack, to what end?
67: Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;
68: For if he'll do as he is made to do,
69: I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.
70: You have put me into rhyme.
71: Lord: Farewell; you're angry.
72: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Still going?
73: This is a lord! O noble misery,
74: To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!
75: To-day how many would have given their honours
76: To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,
77: And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,
78: Could not find death where I did hear him groan,
79: Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,
80: 'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,
81: Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we
82: That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him
83: For being now a favourer to the Briton,
84: No more a Briton, I have resumed again
85: The part I came in: fight I will no more,
86: But yield me to the veriest hind that shall
87: Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
88: Here made by the Roman; great the answer be
89: Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death;
90: On either side I come to spend my breath;
91: Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,
92: But end it by some means for Imogen.
93: First Captain: Great Jupiter be praised! Lucius is taken.
94: 'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.
95: Second Captain: There was a fourth man, in a silly habit,
96: That gave the affront with them.
97: First Captain: So 'tis reported:
98: But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?
99: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: A Roman,
100: Who had not now been drooping here, if seconds
101: Had answer'd him.
102: Second Captain: Lay hands on him; a dog!
103: A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
104: What crows have peck'd them here. He brags
105: his service
106: As if he were of note: bring him to the king.
ACT 5 SCENE 4

1: First Gaoler: You shall not now be stol'n, you have locks upon you;
2: So graze as you find pasture.
3: Second Gaoler: Ay, or a stomach.
4: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Most welcome, bondage! for thou art away,
5: think, to liberty: yet am I better
6: Than one that's sick o' the gout; since he had rather
7: Groan so in perpetuity than be cured
8: By the sure physician, death, who is the key
9: To unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd
10: More than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give me
11: The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,
12: Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?
13: So children temporal fathers do appease;
14: Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?
15: I cannot do it better than in gyves,
16: Desired more than constrain'd: to satisfy,
17: If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take
18: No stricter render of me than my all.
19: I know you are more clement than vile men,
20: Who of their broken debtors take a third,
21: A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
22: On their abatement: that's not my desire:
23: For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though
24: 'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it:
25: 'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;
26: Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake:
27: You rather mine, being yours: and so, great powers,
28: If you will take this audit, take this life,
29: And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!
30: I'll speak to thee in silence.
31: Sicilius Leonatus: No more, thou thunder-master, show
32: Thy spite on mortal flies:
33: With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,
34: That thy adulteries
35: Rates and revenges.
36: Hath my poor boy done aught but well,
37: Whose face I never saw?
38: I died whilst in the womb he stay'd
39: Attending nature's law:
40: Whose father then, as men report
41: Thou orphans' father art,
42: Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him
43: From this earth-vexing smart.
44: Mother: Lucina lent not me her aid,
45: But took me in my throes;
46: That from me was Posthumus ript,
47: Came crying 'mongst his foes,
48: A thing of pity!
49: Sicilius Leonatus: Great nature, like his ancestry,
50: Moulded the stuff so fair,
51: That he deserved the praise o' the world,
52: As great Sicilius' heir.
53: First Brother: When once he was mature for man,
54: In Britain where was he
55: That could stand up his parallel;
56: Or fruitful object be
57: In eye of Imogen, that best
58: Could deem his dignity?
59: Mother: With marriage wherefore was he mock'd,
60: To be exiled, and thrown
61: From Leonati seat, and cast
62: From her his dearest one,
63: Sweet Imogen?
64: Sicilius Leonatus: Why did you suffer Iachimo,
65: Slight thing of Italy,
66: To taint his nobler heart and brain
67: With needless jealosy;
68: And to become the geck and scorn
69: O' th' other's villany?
70: Second Brother: For this from stiller seats we came,
71: Our parents and us twain,
72: That striking in our country's cause
73: Fell bravely and were slain,
74: Our fealty and Tenantius' right
75: With honour to maintain.
76: First Brother: Like hardiment Posthumus hath
77: To Cymbeline perform'd:
78: Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,
79: Why hast thou thus adjourn'd
80: The graces for his merits due,
81: Being all to dolours turn'd?
82: Sicilius Leonatus: Thy crystal window ope; look out;
83: No longer exercise
84: Upon a valiant race thy harsh
85: And potent injuries.
86: Mother: Since, Jupiter, our son is good,
87: Take off his miseries.
88: Sicilius Leonatus: Peep through thy marble mansion; help;
89: Or we poor ghosts will cry
90: To the shining synod of the rest
91: Against thy deity.
92: Second Brother: Help, Jupiter; or we appeal,
93: And from thy justice fly.
94: Jupiter: No more, you petty spirits of region low,
95: Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghosts
96: Accuse the thunderer, whose bolt, you know,
97: Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?
98: Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and rest
99: Upon your never-withering banks of flowers:
100: Be not with mortal accidents opprest;
101: No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours.
102: Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,
103: The more delay'd, delighted. Be content;
104: Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift:
105: His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.
106: Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth, and in
107: Our temple was he married. Rise, and fade.
108: He shall be lord of lady Imogen,
109: And happier much by his affliction made.
110: This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein
111: Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine:
112: and so, away: no further with your din
113: Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
114: Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.
115: Sicilius Leonatus: He came in thunder; his celestial breath
116: Was sulphurous to smell: the holy eagle
117: Stoop'd as to foot us: his ascension is
118: More sweet than our blest fields: his royal bird
119: Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,
120: As when his god is pleased.
121: All: Thanks, Jupiter!
122: Sicilius Leonatus: The marble pavement closes, he is enter'd
123: His radiant root. Away! and, to be blest,
124: Let us with care perform his great behest.
125: Posthumus Leonatus: [Waking] Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begot
126: A father to me; and thou hast created
127: A mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!
128: Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:
129: And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend
130: On greatness' favour dream as I have done,
131: Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve:
132: Many dream not to find, neither deserve,
133: And yet are steep'd in favours: so am I,
134: That have this golden chance and know not why.
135: What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!
136: Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment
137: Nobler than that it covers: let thy effects
138: So follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,
139: As good as promise.
140: 'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown,
141: without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of
142: tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be
143: lopped branches, which, being dead many years,
144: shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock and
145: freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries,
146: Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.'
147: 'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen
148: Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing;
149: Or senseless speaking or a speaking such
150: As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,
151: The action of my life is like it, which
152: I'll keep, if but for sympathy.
153: First Gaoler: Come, sir, are you ready for death?
154: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.
155: First Gaoler: Hanging is the word, sir: if
156: you be ready for that, you are well cooked.
157: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: So, if I prove a good repast to the
158: spectators, the dish pays the shot.
159: First Gaoler: A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is,
160: you shall be called to no more payments, fear no
161: more tavern-bills; which are often the sadness of
162: parting, as the procuring of mirth: you come in
163: flint for want of meat, depart reeling with too
164: much drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and
165: sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain
166: both empty; the brain the heavier for being too
167: light, the purse too light, being drawn of
168: heaviness: of this contradiction you shall now be
169: quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up
170: thousands in a trice: you have no true debitor and
171: creditor but it; of what's past, is, and to come,
172: the discharge: your neck, sir, is pen, book and
173: counters; so the acquittance follows.
174: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: I am merrier to die than thou art to live.
175: First Gaoler: Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the
176: tooth-ache: but a man that were to sleep your
177: sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he
178: would change places with his officer; for, look you,
179: sir, you know not which way you shall go.
180: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Yes, indeed do I, fellow.
181: First Gaoler: Your death has eyes in 's head then; I have not seen
182: him so pictured: you must either be directed by
183: some that take upon them to know, or do take upon
184: yourself that which I am sure you do not know, or
185: jump the after inquiry on your own peril: and how
186: you shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'll
187: never return to tell one.
188: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to
189: direct them the way I am going, but such as wink and
190: will not use them.
191: First Gaoler: What an infinite mock is this, that a man should
192: have the best use of eyes to see the way of
193: blindness! I am sure hanging's the way of winking.
194: Messenger: Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the king.
195: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Thou bring'st good news; I am called to be made free.
196: First Gaoler: I'll be hang'd then.
197: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead.
198: First Gaoler: Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young
199: gibbets, I never saw one so prone. Yet, on my
200: conscience, there are verier knaves desire to live,
201: for all he be a Roman: and there be some of them
202: too that die against their wills; so should I, if I
203: were one. I would we were all of one mind, and one
204: mind good; O, there were desolation of gaolers and
205: gallowses! I speak against my present profit, but
206: my wish hath a preferment in 't.
ACT 5 SCENE 5

1: CYMBELINE: Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
2: Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart
3: That the poor soldier that so richly fought,
4: Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breast
5: Stepp'd before larges of proof, cannot be found:
6: He shall be happy that can find him, if
7: Our grace can make him so.
8: BELARIUS: I never saw
9: Such noble fury in so poor a thing;
10: Such precious deeds in one that promises nought
11: But beggary and poor looks.
12: CYMBELINE: No tidings of him?
13: PISANIO: He hath been search'd among the dead and living,
14: But no trace of him.
15: CYMBELINE: To my grief, I am
16: The heir of his reward;
17: which I will add
18: To you, the liver, heart and brain of Britain,
19: By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the time
20: To ask of whence you are. Report it.
21: BELARIUS: Sir,
22: In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen:
23: Further to boast were neither true nor modest,
24: Unless I add, we are honest.
25: CYMBELINE: Bow your knees.
26: Arise my knights o' the battle: I create you
27: Companions to our person and will fit you
28: With dignities becoming your estates.
29: There's business in these faces. Why so sadly
30: Greet you our victory? you look like Romans,
31: And not o' the court of Britain.
32: CORNELIUS: Hail, great king!
33: To sour your happiness, I must report
34: The queen is dead.
35: CYMBELINE: Who worse than a physician
36: Would this report become? But I consider,
37: By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet death
38: Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?
39: CORNELIUS: With horror, madly dying, like her life,
40: Which, being cruel to the world, concluded
41: Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd
42: I will report, so please you: these her women
43: Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks
44: Were present when she finish'd.
45: CYMBELINE: Prithee, say.
46: CORNELIUS: First, she confess'd she never loved you, only
47: Affected greatness got by you, not you:
48: Married your royalty, was wife to your place;
49: Abhorr'd your person.
50: CYMBELINE: She alone knew this;
51: And, but she spoke it dying, I would not
52: Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.
53: CORNELIUS: Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love
54: With such integrity, she did confess
55: Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,
56: But that her flight prevented it, she had
57: Ta'en off by poison.
58: CYMBELINE: O most delicate fiend!
59: Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?
60: CORNELIUS: More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had
61: For you a mortal mineral; which, being took,
62: Should by the minute feed on life and lingering
63: By inches waste you: in which time she purposed,
64: By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to
65: O'ercome you with her show, and in time,
66: When she had fitted you with her craft, to work
67: Her son into the adoption of the crown:
68: But, failing of her end by his strange absence,
69: Grew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despite
70: Of heaven and men, her purposes; repented
71: The evils she hatch'd were not effected; so
72: Despairing died.
73: CYMBELINE: Heard you all this, her women?
74: First Lady: We did, so please your highness.
75: CYMBELINE: Mine eyes
76: Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;
77: Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,
78: That thought her like her seeming; it had
79: been vicious
80: To have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!
81: That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,
82: And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!
83: Thou comest not, Caius, now for tribute that
84: The Britons have razed out, though with the loss
85: Of many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suit
86: That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter
87: Of you their captives, which ourself have granted:
88: So think of your estate.
89: CAIUS LUCIUS: Consider, sir, the chance of war: the day
90: Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,
91: We should not, when the blood was cool,
92: have threaten'd
93: Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods
94: Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives
95: May be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficeth
96: A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:
97: Augustus lives to think on't: and so much
98: For my peculiar care. This one thing only
99: I will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,
100: Let him be ransom'd: never master had
101: A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
102: So tender over his occasions, true,
103: So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue join
104: With my request, which I make bold your highness
105: Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,
106: Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,
107: And spare no blood beside.
108: CYMBELINE: I have surely seen him:
109: His favour is familiar to me. Boy,
110: Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,
111: And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,
112: To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:
113: And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,
114: Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;
115: Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,
116: The noblest ta'en.
117: IMOGEN: I humbly thank your highness.
118: CAIUS LUCIUS: I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;
119: And yet I know thou wilt.
120: IMOGEN: No, no: alack,
121: There's other work in hand: I see a thing
122: Bitter to me as death: your life, good master,
123: Must shuffle for itself.
124: CAIUS LUCIUS: The boy disdains me,
125: He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys
126: That place them on the truth of girls and boys.
127: Why stands he so perplex'd?
128: CYMBELINE: What wouldst thou, boy?
129: I love thee more and more: think more and more
130: What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,
131: Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?
132: IMOGEN: He is a Roman; no more kin to me
133: Than I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,
134: Am something nearer.
135: CYMBELINE: Wherefore eyest him so?
136: IMOGEN: I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please
137: To give me hearing.
138: CYMBELINE: Ay, with all my heart,
139: And lend my best attention. What's thy name?
140: IMOGEN: Fidele, sir.
141: CYMBELINE: Thou'rt my good youth, my page;
142: I'll be thy master: walk with me; speak freely.
143: BELARIUS: Is not this boy revived from death?
144: ARVIRAGUS: One sand another
145: Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
146: Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?
147: GUIDERIUS: The same dead thing alive.
148: BELARIUS: Peace, peace! see further; he eyes us not; forbear;
149: Creatures may be alike: were 't he, I am sure
150: He would have spoke to us.
151: GUIDERIUS: But we saw him dead.
152: BELARIUS: Be silent; let's see further.
153: PISANIO: [Aside] It is my mistress:
154: Since she is living, let the time run on
155: To good or bad.
156: CYMBELINE: Come, stand thou by our side;
157: Make thy demand aloud.
158: Sir, step you forth;
159: Give answer to this boy, and do it freely;
160: Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,
161: Which is our honour, bitter torture shall
162: Winnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.
163: IMOGEN: My boon is, that this gentleman may render
164: Of whom he had this ring.
165: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: [Aside] What's that to him?
166: CYMBELINE: That diamond upon your finger, say
167: How came it yours?
168: IACHIMO: Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
169: Which, to be spoke, would torture thee.
170: CYMBELINE: How! me?
171: IACHIMO: I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that
172: Which torments me to conceal. By villany
173: I got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel;
174: Whom thou didst banish; and--which more may
175: grieve thee,
176: As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived
177: 'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?
178: CYMBELINE: All that belongs to this.
179: IACHIMO: That paragon, thy daughter,--
180: For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits
181: Quail to remember--Give me leave; I faint.
182: CYMBELINE: My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:
183: I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
184: Than die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.
185: IACHIMO: Upon a time,--unhappy was the clock
186: That struck the hour!--it was in Rome,--accursed
187: The mansion where!--'twas at a feast,--O, would
188: Our viands had been poison'd, or at least
189: Those which I heaved to head!--the good Posthumus--
190: What should I say? he was too good to be
191: Where ill men were; and was the best of all
192: Amongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly,
193: Hearing us praise our loves of Italy
194: For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast
195: Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming
196: The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.
197: Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,
198: A shop of all the qualities that man
199: Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,
200: Fairness which strikes the eye--
201: CYMBELINE: I stand on fire:
202: Come to the matter.
203: IACHIMO: All too soon I shall,
204: Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,
205: Most like a noble lord in love and one
206: That had a royal lover, took his hint;
207: And, not dispraising whom we praised,--therein
208: He was as calm as virtue--he began
209: His mistress' picture; which by his tongue
210: being made,
211: And then a mind put in't, either our brags
212: Were crack'd of kitchen-trolls, or his description
213: Proved us unspeaking sots.
214: CYMBELINE: Nay, nay, to the purpose.
215: IACHIMO: Your daughter's chastity--there it begins.
216: He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,
217: And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,
218: Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him
219: Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore
220: Upon his honour'd finger, to attain
221: In suit the place of's bed and win this ring
222: By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,
223: No lesser of her honour confident
224: Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;
225: And would so, had it been a carbuncle
226: Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it
227: Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain
228: Post I in this design: well may you, sir,
229: Remember me at court; where I was taught
230: Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
231: 'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd
232: Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain
233: 'Gan in your duller Britain operate
234: Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent:
235: And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,
236: That I return'd with simular proof enough
237: To make the noble Leonatus mad,
238: By wounding his belief in her renown
239: With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes
240: Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,--
241: O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks
242: Of secret on her person, that he could not
243: But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,
244: I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon--
245: Methinks, I see him now--
246: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: [Advancing] Ay, so thou dost,
247: Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,
248: Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
249: That's due to all the villains past, in being,
250: To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,
251: Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send out
252: For torturers ingenious: it is I
253: That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend
254: By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,
255: That kill'd thy daughter:--villain-like, I lie--
256: That caused a lesser villain than myself,
257: A sacrilegious thief, to do't: the temple
258: Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.
259: Spit, and throw stone s, cast mire upon me, set
260: The dogs o' the street to bay me: every villain
261: Be call'd Posthumus Leonitus; and
262: Be villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!
263: My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,
264: Imogen, Imogen!
265: IMOGEN: Peace, my lord; hear, hear--
266: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,
267: There lie thy part.
268: PISANIO: O, gentlemen, help!
269: Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!
270: You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help, help!
271: Mine honour'd lady!
272: CYMBELINE: Does the world go round?
273: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: How come these staggers on me?
274: PISANIO: Wake, my mistress!
275: CYMBELINE: If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me
276: To death with mortal joy.
277: PISANIO: How fares thy mistress?
278: IMOGEN: O, get thee from my sight;
279: Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!
280: Breathe not where princes are.
281: CYMBELINE: The tune of Imogen!
282: PISANIO: Lady,
283: The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if
284: That box I gave you was not thought by me
285: A precious thing: I had it from the queen.
286: CYMBELINE: New matter still?
287: IMOGEN: It poison'd me.
288: CORNELIUS: O gods!
289: I left out one thing which the queen confess'd.
290: Which must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio
291: Have,' said she, 'given his mistress that confection
292: Which I gave him for cordial, she is served
293: As I would serve a rat.'
294: CYMBELINE: What's this, Comelius?
295: CORNELIUS: The queen, sir, very oft importuned me
296: To temper poisons for her, still pretending
297: The satisfaction of her knowledge only
298: In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,
299: Of no esteem: I, dreading that her purpose
300: Was of more danger, did compound for her
301: A certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would cease
302: The present power of life, but in short time
303: All offices of nature should again
304: Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?
305: IMOGEN: Most like I did, for I was dead.
306: BELARIUS: My boys,
307: There was our error.
308: GUIDERIUS: This is, sure, Fidele.
309: IMOGEN: Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?
310: Think that you are upon a rock; and now
311: Throw me again.
312: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Hang there like a fruit, my soul,
313: Till the tree die!
314: CYMBELINE: How now, my flesh, my child!
315: What, makest thou me a dullard in this act?
316: Wilt thou not speak to me?
317: IMOGEN: [Kneeling] Your blessing, sir.
318: BELARIUS: [To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS] Though you did love
319: this youth, I blame ye not:
320: You had a motive for't.
321: CYMBELINE: My tears that fall
322: Prove holy water on thee! Imogen,
323: Thy mother's dead.
324: IMOGEN: I am sorry for't, my lord.
325: CYMBELINE: O, she was nought; and long of her it was
326: That we meet here so strangely: but her son
327: Is gone, we know not how nor where.
328: PISANIO: My lord,
329: Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,
330: Upon my lady's missing, came to me
331: With his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,
332: If I discover'd not which way she was gone,
333: It was my instant death. By accident,
334: had a feigned letter of my master's
335: Then in my pocket; which directed him
336: To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;
337: Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,
338: Which he enforced from me, away he posts
339: With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
340: My lady's honour: what became of him
341: I further know not.
342: GUIDERIUS: Let me end the story:
343: I slew him there.
344: CYMBELINE: Marry, the gods forfend!
345: I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
346: Pluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,
347: Deny't again.
348: GUIDERIUS: I have spoke it, and I did it.
349: CYMBELINE: He was a prince.
350: GUIDERIUS: A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me
351: Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me
352: With language that would make me spurn the sea,
353: If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;
354: And am right glad he is not standing here
355: To tell this tale of mine.
356: CYMBELINE: I am sorry for thee:
357: By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must
358: Endure our law: thou'rt dead.
359: IMOGEN: That headless man
360: I thought had been my lord.
361: CYMBELINE: Bind the offender,
362: And take him from our presence.
363: BELARIUS: Stay, sir king:
364: This man is better than the man he slew,
365: As well descended as thyself; and hath
366: More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
367: Had ever scar for.
368: Let his arms alone;
369: They were not born for bondage.
370: CYMBELINE: Why, old soldier,
371: Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,
372: By tasting of our wrath? How of descent
373: As good as we?
374: ARVIRAGUS: In that he spake too far.
375: CYMBELINE: And thou shalt die for't.
376: BELARIUS: We will die all three:
377: But I will prove that two on's are as good
378: As I have given out him. My sons, I must,
379: For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,
380: Though, haply, well for you.
381: ARVIRAGUS: Your danger's ours.
382: GUIDERIUS: And our good his.
383: BELARIUS: Have at it then, by leave.
384: Thou hadst, great king, a subject who
385: Was call'd Belarius.
386: CYMBELINE: What of him? he is
387: A banish'd traitor.
388: BELARIUS: He it is that hath
389: Assumed this age; indeed a banish'd man;
390: I know not how a traitor.
391: CYMBELINE: Take him hence:
392: The whole world shall not save him.
393: BELARIUS: Not too hot:
394: First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;
395: And let it be confiscate all, so soon
396: As I have received it.
397: CYMBELINE: Nursing of my sons!
398: BELARIUS: I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:
399: Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
400: Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,
401: These two young gentlemen, that call me father
402: And think they are my sons, are none of mine;
403: They are the issue of your loins, my liege,
404: And blood of your begetting.
405: CYMBELINE: How! my issue!
406: BELARIUS: So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,
407: Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:
408: Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment
409: Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd
410: Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes--
411: For such and so they are--these twenty years
412: Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I
413: Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as
414: Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,
415: Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children
416: Upon my banishment: I moved her to't,
417: Having received the punishment before,
418: For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty
419: Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
420: The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped
421: Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,
422: Here are your sons again; and I must lose
423: Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.
424: The benediction of these covering heavens
425: Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy
426: To inlay heaven with stars.
427: CYMBELINE: Thou weep'st, and speak'st.
428: The service that you three have done is more
429: Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:
430: If these be they, I know not how to wish
431: A pair of worthier sons.
432: BELARIUS: Be pleased awhile.
433: This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,
434: Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:
435: This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,
436: Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd
437: In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand
438: Of his queen mother, which for more probation
439: I can with ease produce.
440: CYMBELINE: Guiderius had
441: Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
442: It was a mark of wonder.
443: BELARIUS: This is he;
444: Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:
445: It was wise nature's end in the donation,
446: To be his evidence now.
447: CYMBELINE: O, what, am I
448: A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
449: Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,
450: That, after this strange starting from your orbs,
451: may reign in them now! O Imogen,
452: Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.
453: IMOGEN: No, my lord;
454: I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,
455: Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter
456: But I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,
457: When I was but your sister; I you brothers,
458: When ye were so indeed.
459: CYMBELINE: Did you e'er meet?
460: ARVIRAGUS: Ay, my good lord.
461: GUIDERIUS: And at first meeting loved;
462: Continued so, until we thought he died.
463: CORNELIUS: By the queen's dram she swallow'd.
464: CYMBELINE: O rare instinct!
465: When shall I hear all through? This fierce
466: abridgement
467: Hath to it circumstantial branches, which
468: Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?
469: And when came you to serve our Roman captive?
470: How parted with your brothers? how first met them?
471: Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,
472: And your three motives to the battle, with
473: I know not how much more, should be demanded;
474: And all the other by-dependencies,
475: From chance to chance: but nor the time nor place
476: Will serve our long inter'gatories. See,
477: Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,
478: And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye
479: On him, her brother, me, her master, hitting
480: Each object with a joy: the counterchange
481: Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,
482: And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.
483: Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.
484: IMOGEN: You are my father too, and did relieve me,
485: To see this gracious season.
486: CYMBELINE: All o'erjoy'd,
487: Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,
488: For they shall taste our comfort.
489: IMOGEN: My good master,
490: I will yet do you service.
491: CAIUS LUCIUS: Happy be you!
492: CYMBELINE: The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,
493: He would have well becomed this place, and graced
494: The thankings of a king.
495: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: I am, sir,
496: The soldier that did company these three
497: In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for
498: The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,
499: Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and might
500: Have made you finish.
501: IACHIMO: [Kneeling] I am down again:
502: But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,
503: As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,
504: Which I so often owe: but your ring first;
505: And here the bracelet of the truest princess
506: That ever swore her faith.
507: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Kneel not to me:
508: The power that I have on you is, to spare you;
509: The malice towards you to forgive you: live,
510: And deal with others better.
511: CYMBELINE: Nobly doom'd!
512: We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;
513: Pardon's the word to all.
514: ARVIRAGUS: You holp us, sir,
515: As you did mean indeed to be our brother;
516: Joy'd are we that you are.
517: POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,
518: Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methought
519: Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,
520: Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows
521: Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found
522: This label on my bosom; whose containing
523: Is so from sense in hardness, that I can
524: Make no collection of it: let him show
525: His skill in the construction.
526: CAIUS LUCIUS: Philarmonus!
527: Soothsayer: Here, my good lord.
528: CAIUS LUCIUS: Read, and declare the meaning.
529: Soothsayer: [Reads] 'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself
530: unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a
531: piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar
532: shall be lopped branches, which, being dead many
533: years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old
534: stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end
535: his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in
536: peace and plenty.'
537: Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;
538: The fit and apt construction of thy name,
539: Being Leonatus, doth import so much.
540: The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,
541: Which we call 'mollis aer;' and 'mollis aer'
542: We term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divine
543: Is this most constant wife; who, even now,
544: Answering the letter of the oracle,
545: Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about
546: With this most tender air.
547: CYMBELINE: This hath some seeming.
548: Soothsayer: The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,
549: Personates thee: and thy lopp'd branches point
550: Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,
551: For many years thought dead, are now revived,
552: To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue
553: Promises Britain peace and plenty.
554: CYMBELINE: Well
555: My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,
556: Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,
557: And to the Roman empire; promising
558: To pay our wonted tribute, from the which
559: We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;
560: Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,
561: Have laid most heavy hand.
562: Soothsayer: The fingers of the powers above do tune
563: The harmony of this peace. The vision
564: Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke
565: Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant
566: Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,
567: From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
568: Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun
569: So vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,
570: The imperial Caesar, should again unite
571: His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,
572: Which shines here in the west.
