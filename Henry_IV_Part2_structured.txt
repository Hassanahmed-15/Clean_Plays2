ACT 1 SCENE 1

1: LORD BARDOLPH: Who keeps the gate here, ho?
2: Where is the earl?
3: Porter: What shall I say you are?
4: LORD BARDOLPH: Tell thou the earl
5: That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.
6: Porter: His lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard;
7: Please it your honour, knock but at the gate,
8: And he himself wilt answer.
9: LORD BARDOLPH: Here comes the earl.
10: NORTHUMBERLAND: What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now
11: Should be the father of some stratagem:
12: The times are wild: contention, like a horse
13: Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose
14: And bears down all before him.
15: LORD BARDOLPH: Noble earl,
16: I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.
17: NORTHUMBERLAND: Good, an God will!
18: LORD BARDOLPH: As good as heart can wish:
19: The king is almost wounded to the death;
20: And, in the fortune of my lord your son,
21: Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts
22: Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John
23: And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;
24: And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,
25: Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day,
26: So fought, so follow'd and so fairly won,
27: Came not till now to dignify the times,
28: Since Caesar's fortunes!
29: NORTHUMBERLAND: How is this derived?
30: Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?
31: LORD BARDOLPH: I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,
32: A gentleman well bred and of good name,
33: That freely render'd me these news for true.
34: NORTHUMBERLAND: Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent
35: On Tuesday last to listen after news.
36: LORD BARDOLPH: My lord, I over-rode him on the way;
37: And he is furnish'd with no certainties
38: More than he haply may retail from me.
39: NORTHUMBERLAND: Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?
40: TRAVERS: My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back
41: With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,
42: Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
43: A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
44: That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.
45: He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him
46: I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:
47: He told me that rebellion had bad luck
48: And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.
49: With that, he gave his able horse the head,
50: And bending forward struck his armed heels
51: Against the panting sides of his poor jade
52: Up to the rowel-head, and starting so
53: He seem'd in running to devour the way,
54: Staying no longer question.
55: NORTHUMBERLAND: Ha! Again:
56: Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?
57: Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion
58: Had met ill luck?
59: LORD BARDOLPH: My lord, I'll tell you what;
60: If my young lord your son have not the day,
61: Upon mine honour, for a silken point
62: I'll give my barony: never talk of it.
63: NORTHUMBERLAND: Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers
64: Give then such instances of loss?
65: LORD BARDOLPH: Who, he?
66: He was some hilding fellow that had stolen
67: The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,
68: Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.
69: NORTHUMBERLAND: Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,
70: Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:
71: So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
72: Hath left a witness'd usurpation.
73: Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?
74: MORTON: I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;
75: Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
76: To fright our party.
77: NORTHUMBERLAND: How doth my son and brother?
78: Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek
79: Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.
80: Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,
81: So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,
82: Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,
83: And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;
84: But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,
85: And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.
86: This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;
87: Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'
88: Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:
89: But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,
90: Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,
91: Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'
92: MORTON: Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;
93: But, for my lord your son--
94: NORTHUMBERLAND: Why, he is dead.
95: See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!
96: He that but fears the thing he would not know
97: Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes
98: That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;
99: Tell thou an earl his divination lies,
100: And I will take it as a sweet disgrace
101: And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.
102: MORTON: You are too great to be by me gainsaid:
103: Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.
104: NORTHUMBERLAND: Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.
105: I see a strange confession in thine eye:
106: Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin
107: To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;
108: The tongue offends not that reports his death:
109: And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,
110: Not he which says the dead is not alive.
111: Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
112: Hath but a losing office, and his tongue
113: Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,
114: Remember'd tolling a departing friend.
115: LORD BARDOLPH: I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.
116: MORTON: I am sorry I should force you to believe
117: That which I would to God I had not seen;
118: But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,
119: Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,
120: To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down
121: The never-daunted Percy to the earth,
122: From whence with life he never more sprung up.
123: In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire
124: Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,
125: Being bruited once, took fire and heat away
126: From the best temper'd courage in his troops;
127: For from his metal was his party steel'd;
128: Which once in him abated, all the rest
129: Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:
130: And as the thing that's heavy in itself,
131: Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,
132: So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,
133: Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
134: That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
135: Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,
136: Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester
137: Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,
138: The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword
139: Had three times slain the appearance of the king,
140: 'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
141: Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,
142: Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all
143: Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out
144: A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
145: Under the conduct of young Lancaster
146: And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.
147: NORTHUMBERLAND: For this I shall have time enough to mourn.
148: In poison there is physic; and these news,
149: Having been well, that would have made me sick,
150: Being sick, have in some measure made me well:
151: And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,
152: Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,
153: Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire
154: Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,
155: Weaken'd with grief, being now enraged with grief,
156: Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!
157: A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
158: Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!
159: Thou art a guard too wanton for the head
160: Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.
161: Now bind my brows with iron; and approach
162: The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring
163: To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!
164: Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand
165: Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!
166: And let this world no longer be a stage
167: To feed contention in a lingering act;
168: But let one spirit of the first-born Cain
169: Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set
170: On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,
171: And darkness be the burier of the dead!
172: TRAVERS: This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.
173: LORD BARDOLPH: Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.
174: MORTON: The lives of all your loving complices
175: Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er
176: To stormy passion, must perforce decay.
177: You cast the event of war, my noble lord,
178: And summ'd the account of chance, before you said
179: 'Let us make head.' It was your presurmise,
180: That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:
181: You knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge,
182: More likely to fall in than to get o'er;
183: You were advised his flesh was capable
184: Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit
185: Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:
186: Yet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this,
187: Though strongly apprehended, could restrain
188: The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,
189: Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,
190: More than that being which was like to be?
191: LORD BARDOLPH: We all that are engaged to this loss
192: Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
193: That if we wrought our life 'twas ten to one;
194: And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed
195: Choked the respect of likely peril fear'd;
196: And since we are o'erset, venture again.
197: Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.
198: MORTON: 'Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,
199: I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,
200: The gentle Archbishop of York is up
201: With well-appointed powers: he is a man
202: Who with a double surety binds his followers.
203: My lord your son had only but the corpse,
204: But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;
205: For that same word, rebellion, did divide
206: The action of their bodies from their souls;
207: And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,
208: As men drink potions, that their weapons only
209: Seem'd on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,
210: This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,
211: As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop
212: Turns insurrection to religion:
213: Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,
214: He's followed both with body and with mind;
215: And doth enlarge his rising with the blood
216: Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;
217: Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;
218: Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,
219: Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;
220: And more and less do flock to follow him.
221: NORTHUMBERLAND: I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,
222: This present grief had wiped it from my mind.
223: Go in with me; and counsel every man
224: The aptest way for safety and revenge:
225: Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:
226: Never so few, and never yet more need.
ACT 1 SCENE 2

1: FALSTAFF: Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?
2: Page: He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy
3: water; but, for the party that owed it, he might
4: have more diseases than he knew for.
5: FALSTAFF: Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the
6: brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not
7: able to invent anything that tends to laughter, more
8: than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only
9: witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other
10: men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that
11: hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the
12: prince put thee into my service for any other reason
13: than to set me off, why then I have no judgment.
14: Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn
15: in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never
16: manned with an agate till now: but I will inset you
17: neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and
18: send you back again to your master, for a jewel,--
19: the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is
20: not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in
21: the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his
22: cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is
23: a face-royal: God may finish it when he will, 'tis
24: not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at a
25: face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence
26: out of it; and yet he'll be crowing as if he had
27: writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He
28: may keep his own grace, but he's almost out of mine,
29: I can assure him. What said Master Dombledon about
30: the satin for my short cloak and my slops?
31: Page: He said, sir, you should procure him better
32: assurance than Bardolph: he would not take his
33: band and yours; he liked not the security.
34: FALSTAFF: Let him be damned, like the glutton! pray God his
35: tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! a rascally
36: yea-forsooth knave! to bear a gentleman in hand,
37: and then stand upon security! The whoreson
38: smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and
39: bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is
40: through with them in honest taking up, then they
41: must stand upon security. I had as lief they would
42: put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with
43: security. I looked a' should have sent me two and
44: twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he
45: sends me security. Well, he may sleep in security;
46: for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness
47: of his wife shines through it: and yet cannot he
48: see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him.
49: Where's Bardolph?
50: Page: He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse.
51: FALSTAFF: I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse in
52: Smithfield: an I could get me but a wife in the
53: stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived.
54: Page: Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the
55: Prince for striking him about Bardolph.
56: FALSTAFF: Wait, close; I will not see him.
57: Lord Chief-Justice What's he that goes there?
58: Servant: Falstaff, an't please your lordship.
59: Lord Chief-Justice He that was in question for the robbery?
60: He, my lord: but he hath since done good service at
61: Shrewsbury; and, as I hear, is now going with some
62: charge to the Lord John of Lancaster.
63: Lord Chief-Justice What, to York? Call him back again.
64: Sir John Falstaff!
65: FALSTAFF: Boy, tell him I am deaf.
66: Page: You must speak louder; my master is deaf.
67: Lord Chief-Justice I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing good.
68: Go, pluck him by the elbow; I must speak with him.
69: Servant: Sir John!
70: FALSTAFF: What! a young knave, and begging! Is there not
71: wars? is there not employment? doth not the king
72: lack subjects? do not the rebels need soldiers?
73: Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it
74: is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side,
75: were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell
76: how to make it.
77: Servant: You mistake me, sir.
78: FALSTAFF: Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? setting
79: my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied
80: in my throat, if I had said so.
81: Servant: I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and our
82: soldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you,
83: you lie in your throat, if you say I am any other
84: than an honest man.
85: FALSTAFF: I give thee leave to tell me so! I lay aside that
86: which grows to me! if thou gettest any leave of me,
87: hang me; if thou takest leave, thou wert better be
88: hanged. You hunt counter: hence! avaunt!
89: Servant: Sir, my lord would speak with you.
90: Lord Chief-Justice Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.
91: FALSTAFF: My good lord! God give your lordship good time of
92: day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heard
93: say your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship
94: goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not
95: clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in
96: you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I must
97: humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care
98: of your health.
99: Lord Chief-Justice Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to
100: Shrewsbury.
101: An't please your lordship, I hear his majesty is
102: returned with some discomfort from Wales.
103: Lord Chief-Justice I talk not of his majesty: you would not come when
104: I sent for you.
105: And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into
106: this same whoreson apoplexy.
107: Lord Chief-Justice Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak with
108: you.
109: This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy,
110: an't please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the
111: blood, a whoreson tingling.
112: Lord Chief-Justice What tell you me of it? be it as it is.
113: It hath its original from much grief, from study and
114: perturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of
115: his effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.
116: Lord Chief-Justice I think you are fallen into the disease; for you
117: hear not what I say to you.
118: Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an't please
119: you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady
120: of not marking, that I am troubled withal.
121: Lord Chief-Justice To punish you by the heels would amend the
122: attention of your ears; and I care not if I do
123: become your physician.
124: I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:
125: your lordship may minister the potion of
126: imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how
127: should I be your patient to follow your
128: prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a
129: scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.
130: Lord Chief-Justice I sent for you, when there were matters against you
131: for your life, to come speak with me.
132: As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the
133: laws of this land-service, I did not come.
134: Lord Chief-Justice Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.
135: He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less.
136: Lord Chief-Justice Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.
137: I would it were otherwise; I would my means were
138: greater, and my waist slenderer.
139: Lord Chief-Justice You have misled the youthful prince.
140: The young prince hath misled me: I am the fellow
141: with the great belly, and he my dog.
142: Lord Chief-Justice Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: your
143: day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded
144: over your night's exploit on Gad's-hill: you may
145: thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'er-posting
146: that action.
147: My lord?
148: Lord Chief-Justice But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a
149: sleeping wolf.
150: To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.
151: Lord Chief-Justice What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt
152: out.
153: A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did say
154: of wax, my growth would approve the truth.
155: Lord Chief-Justice There is not a white hair on your face but should
156: have his effect of gravity.
157: His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.
158: Lord Chief-Justice You follow the young prince up and down, like his
159: ill angel.
160: Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope
161: he that looks upon me will take me without weighing:
162: and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I
163: cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these
164: costermonger times that true valour is turned
165: bear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath
166: his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all the
167: other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of
168: this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry.
169: You that are old consider not the capacities of us
170: that are young; you do measure the heat of our
171: livers with the bitterness of your galls: and we
172: that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess,
173: are wags too.
174: Lord Chief-Justice Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth,
175: that are written down old with all the characters of
176: age? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a
177: yellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an
178: increasing belly? is not your voice broken? your
179: wind short? your chin double? your wit single? and
180: every part about you blasted with antiquity? and
181: will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!
182: My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the
183: afternoon, with a white head and something a round
184: belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing
185: and singing of anthems. To approve my youth
186: further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in
187: judgment and understanding; and he that will caper
188: with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the
189: money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that
190: the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,
191: and you took it like a sensible lord. I have
192: chequed him for it, and the young lion repents;
193: marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk
194: and old sack.
195: Lord Chief-Justice Well, God send the prince a better companion!
196: God send the companion a better prince! I cannot
197: rid my hands of him.
198: Lord Chief-Justice Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry: I
199: hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster
200: against the Archbishop and the Earl of
201: Northumberland.
202: Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look
203: you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,
204: that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the
205: Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean
206: not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day,
207: and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I
208: might never spit white again. There is not a
209: dangerous action can peep out his head but I am
210: thrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it
211: was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if
212: they have a good thing, to make it too common. If
213: ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give
214: me rest. I would to God my name were not so
215: terrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to be
216: eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to
217: nothing with perpetual motion.
218: Lord Chief-Justice Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless your
219: expedition!
220: Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to
221: furnish me forth?
222: Lord Chief-Justice Not a penny, not a penny; you are too impatient to
223: bear crosses. Fare you well: commend me to my
224: cousin Westmoreland.
225: If I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle. A man
226: can no more separate age and covetousness than a'
227: can part young limbs and lechery: but the gout
228: galls the one, and the pox pinches the other; and
229: so both the degrees prevent my curses. Boy!
230: Page: Sir?
231: FALSTAFF: What money is in my purse?
232: Page: Seven groats and two pence.
233: FALSTAFF: I can get no remedy against this consumption of the
234: purse: borrowing only lingers and lingers it out,
235: but the disease is incurable. Go bear this letter
236: to my Lord of Lancaster; this to the prince; this
237: to the Earl of Westmoreland; and this to old
238: Mistress Ursula, whom I have weekly sworn to marry
239: since I perceived the first white hair on my chin.
240: About it: you know where to find me.
241: A pox of this gout! or, a gout of this pox! for
242: the one or the other plays the rogue with my great
243: toe. 'Tis no matter if I do halt; I have the wars
244: for my colour, and my pension shall seem the more
245: reasonable. A good wit will make use of any thing:
246: I will turn diseases to commodity.
ACT 1 SCENE 3

1: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;
2: And, my most noble friends, I pray you all,
3: Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes:
4: And first, lord marshal, what say you to it?
5: MOWBRAY: I well allow the occasion of our arms;
6: But gladly would be better satisfied
7: How in our means we should advance ourselves
8: To look with forehead bold and big enough
9: Upon the power and puissance of the king.
10: HASTINGS: Our present musters grow upon the file
11: To five and twenty thousand men of choice;
12: And our supplies live largely in the hope
13: Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns
14: With an incensed fire of injuries.
15: LORD BARDOLPH: The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus;
16: Whether our present five and twenty thousand
17: May hold up head without Northumberland?
18: HASTINGS: With him, we may.
19: LORD BARDOLPH: Yea, marry, there's the point:
20: But if without him we be thought too feeble,
21: My judgment is, we should not step too far
22: Till we had his assistance by the hand;
23: For in a theme so bloody-faced as this
24: Conjecture, expectation, and surmise
25: Of aids incertain should not be admitted.
26: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: 'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeed
27: It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.
28: LORD BARDOLPH: It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,
29: Eating the air on promise of supply,
30: Flattering himself in project of a power
31: Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts:
32: And so, with great imagination
33: Proper to madmen, led his powers to death
34: And winking leap'd into destruction.
35: HASTINGS: But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt
36: To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.
37: LORD BARDOLPH: Yes, if this present quality of war,
38: Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot
39: Lives so in hope as in an early spring
40: We see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit,
41: Hope gives not so much warrant as despair
42: That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,
43: We first survey the plot, then draw the model;
44: And when we see the figure of the house,
45: Then must we rate the cost of the erection;
46: Which if we find outweighs ability,
47: What do we then but draw anew the model
48: In fewer offices, or at last desist
49: To build at all? Much more, in this great work,
50: Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
51: And set another up, should we survey
52: The plot of situation and the model,
53: Consent upon a sure foundation,
54: Question surveyors, know our own estate,
55: How able such a work to undergo,
56: To weigh against his opposite; or else
57: We fortify in paper and in figures,
58: Using the names of men instead of men:
59: Like one that draws the model of a house
60: Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,
61: Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost
62: A naked subject to the weeping clouds
63: And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.
64: HASTINGS: Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth,
65: Should be still-born, and that we now possess'd
66: The utmost man of expectation,
67: I think we are a body strong enough,
68: Even as we are, to equal with the king.
69: LORD BARDOLPH: What, is the king but five and twenty thousand?
70: HASTINGS: To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph.
71: For his divisions, as the times do brawl,
72: Are in three heads: one power against the French,
73: And one against Glendower; perforce a third
74: Must take up us: so is the unfirm king
75: In three divided; and his coffers sound
76: With hollow poverty and emptiness.
77: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: That he should draw his several strengths together
78: And come against us in full puissance,
79: Need not be dreaded.
80: HASTINGS: If he should do so,
81: He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh
82: Baying him at the heels: never fear that.
83: LORD BARDOLPH: Who is it like should lead his forces hither?
84: HASTINGS: The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;
85: Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth:
86: But who is substituted 'gainst the French,
87: I have no certain notice.
88: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: Let us on,
89: And publish the occasion of our arms.
90: The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;
91: Their over-greedy love hath surfeited:
92: An habitation giddy and unsure
93: Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.
94: O thou fond many, with what loud applause
95: Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,
96: Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!
97: And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,
98: Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,
99: That thou provokest thyself to cast him up.
100: So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge
101: Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard;
102: And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,
103: And howl'st to find it. What trust is in
104: these times?
105: They that, when Richard lived, would have him die,
106: Are now become enamour'd on his grave:
107: Thou, that threw'st dust upon his goodly head
108: When through proud London he came sighing on
109: After the admired heels of Bolingbroke,
110: Criest now 'O earth, yield us that king again,
111: And take thou this!' O thoughts of men accursed!
112: Past and to come seems best; things present worst.
113: MOWBRAY: Shall we go draw our numbers and set on?
ACT 2 SCENE 1

1: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Master Fang, have you entered the action?
2: FANG: It is entered.
3: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Where's your yeoman? Is't a lusty yeoman? will a'
4: stand to 't?
5: FANG: Sirrah, where's Snare?
6: MISTRESS QUICKLY: O Lord, ay! good Master Snare.
7: SNARE: Here, here.
8: FANG: Snare, we must arrest Sir John Falstaff.
9: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Yea, good Master Snare; I have entered him and all.
10: SNARE: It may chance cost some of us our lives, for he will stab.
11: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Alas the day! take heed of him; he stabbed me in
12: mine own house, and that most beastly: in good
13: faith, he cares not what mischief he does. If his
14: weapon be out: he will foin like any devil; he will
15: spare neither man, woman, nor child.
16: FANG: If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.
17: MISTRESS QUICKLY: No, nor I neither: I'll be at your elbow.
18: FANG: An I but fist him once; an a' come but within my vice,--
19: MISTRESS QUICKLY: I am undone by his going; I warrant you, he's an
20: infinitive thing upon my score. Good Master Fang,
21: hold him sure: good Master Snare, let him not
22: 'scape. A' comes continuantly to Pie-corner--saving
23: your manhoods--to buy a saddle; and he is indited to
24: dinner to the Lubber's-head in Lumbert street, to
25: Master Smooth's the silkman: I pray ye, since my
26: exion is entered and my case so openly known to the
27: world, let him be brought in to his answer. A
28: hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to
29: bear: and I have borne, and borne, and borne, and
30: have been fubbed off, and fubbed off, and fubbed
31: off, from this day to that day, that it is a shame
32: to be thought on. There is no honesty in such
33: dealing; unless a woman should be made an ass and a
34: beast, to bear every knave's wrong. Yonder he
35: comes; and that errant malmsey-nose knave, Bardolph,
36: with him. Do your offices, do your offices: Master
37: Fang and Master Snare, do me, do me, do me your offices.
38: FALSTAFF: How now! whose mare's dead? what's the matter?
39: FANG: Sir John, I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly.
40: FALSTAFF: Away, varlets! Draw, Bardolph: cut me off the
41: villain's head: throw the quean in the channel.
42: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Throw me in the channel! I'll throw thee in the
43: channel. Wilt thou? wilt thou? thou bastardly
44: rogue! Murder, murder! Ah, thou honeysuckle
45: villain! wilt thou kill God's officers and the
46: king's? Ah, thou honey-seed rogue! thou art a
47: honey-seed, a man-queller, and a woman-queller.
48: FALSTAFF: Keep them off, Bardolph.
49: FANG: A rescue! a rescue!
50: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Good people, bring a rescue or two. Thou wo't, wo't
51: thou? Thou wo't, wo't ta? do, do, thou rogue! do,
52: thou hemp-seed!
53: FALSTAFF: Away, you scullion! you rampallion! You
54: fustilarian! I'll tickle your catastrophe.
55: Lord Chief-Justice What is the matter? keep the peace here, ho!
56: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Good my lord, be good to me. I beseech you, stand to me.
57: Lord Chief-Justice How now, Sir John! what are you brawling here?
58: Doth this become your place, your time and business?
59: You should have been well on your way to York.
60: Stand from him, fellow: wherefore hang'st upon him?
61: O most worshipful lord, an't please your grace, I am
62: a poor widow of Eastcheap, and he is arrested at my suit.
63: Lord Chief-Justice For what sum?
64: It is more than for some, my lord; it is for all,
65: all I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home;
66: he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of
67: his: but I will have some of it out again, or I
68: will ride thee o' nights like the mare.
69: FALSTAFF: I think I am as like to ride the mare, if I have
70: any vantage of ground to get up.
71: Lord Chief-Justice How comes this, Sir John? Fie! what man of good
72: temper would endure this tempest of exclamation?
73: Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so
74: rough a course to come by her own?
75: What is the gross sum that I owe thee?
76: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the
77: money too. Thou didst swear to me upon a
78: parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin-chamber,
79: at the round table, by a sea-coal fire, upon
80: Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the prince broke
81: thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of
82: Windsor, thou didst swear to me then, as I was
83: washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady
84: thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife
85: Keech, the butcher's wife, come in then and call me
86: gossip Quickly? coming in to borrow a mess of
87: vinegar; telling us she had a good dish of prawns;
88: whereby thou didst desire to eat some; whereby I
89: told thee they were ill for a green wound? And
90: didst thou not, when she was gone down stairs,
91: desire me to be no more so familiarity with such
92: poor people; saying that ere long they should call
93: me madam? And didst thou not kiss me and bid me
94: fetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy
95: book-oath: deny it, if thou canst.
96: FALSTAFF: My lord, this is a poor mad soul; and she says up
97: and down the town that the eldest son is like you:
98: she hath been in good case, and the truth is,
99: poverty hath distracted her. But for these foolish
100: officers, I beseech you I may have redress against them.
101: Lord Chief-Justice Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your
102: manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It
103: is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words
104: that come with such more than impudent sauciness
105: from you, can thrust me from a level consideration:
106: you have, as it appears to me, practised upon the
107: easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made her
108: serve your uses both in purse and in person.
109: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Yea, in truth, my lord.
110: Lord Chief-Justice Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her, and
111: unpay the villany you have done her: the one you
112: may do with sterling money, and the other with
113: current repentance.
114: FALSTAFF: My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without
115: reply. You call honourable boldness impudent
116: sauciness: if a man will make courtesy and say
117: nothing, he is virtuous: no, my lord, my humble
118: duty remembered, I will not be your suitor. I say
119: to you, I do desire deliverance from these officers,
120: being upon hasty employment in the king's affairs.
121: Lord Chief-Justice You speak as having power to do wrong: but answer
122: in the effect of your reputation, and satisfy this
123: poor woman.
124: Come hither, hostess.
125: Lord Chief-Justice Now, Master Gower, what news?
126: GOWER: The king, my lord, and Harry Prince of Wales
127: Are near at hand: the rest the paper tells.
128: FALSTAFF: As I am a gentleman.
129: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Faith, you said so before.
130: FALSTAFF: As I am a gentleman. Come, no more words of it.
131: MISTRESS QUICKLY: By this heavenly ground I tread on, I must be fain
132: to pawn both my plate and the tapestry of my
133: dining-chambers.
134: FALSTAFF: Glasses, glasses is the only drinking: and for thy
135: walls, a pretty slight drollery, or the story of
136: the Prodigal, or the German hunting in water-work,
137: is worth a thousand of these bed-hangings and these
138: fly-bitten tapestries. Let it be ten pound, if thou
139: canst. Come, an 'twere not for thy humours, there's
140: not a better wench in England. Go, wash thy face,
141: and draw the action. Come, thou must not be in
142: this humour with me; dost not know me? come, come, I
143: know thou wast set on to this.
144: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Pray thee, Sir John, let it be but twenty nobles: i'
145: faith, I am loath to pawn my plate, so God save me,
146: la!
147: FALSTAFF: Let it alone; I'll make other shift: you'll be a
148: fool still.
149: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Well, you shall have it, though I pawn my gown. I
150: hope you'll come to supper. You'll pay me all together?
151: FALSTAFF: Will I live?
152: Go, with her, with her; hook on, hook on.
153: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at supper?
154: FALSTAFF: No more words; let's have her.
155: Lord Chief-Justice I have heard better news.
156: What's the news, my lord?
157: Lord Chief-Justice Where lay the king last night?
158: GOWER: At Basingstoke, my lord.
159: FALSTAFF: I hope, my lord, all's well: what is the news, my lord?
160: Lord Chief-Justice Come all his forces back?
161: GOWER: No; fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse,
162: Are marched up to my lord of Lancaster,
163: Against Northumberland and the Archbishop.
164: FALSTAFF: Comes the king back from Wales, my noble lord?
165: Lord Chief-Justice You shall have letters of me presently:
166: Come, go along with me, good Master Gower.
167: My lord!
168: Lord Chief-Justice What's the matter?
169: Master Gower, shall I entreat you with me to dinner?
170: GOWER: I must wait upon my good lord here; I thank you,
171: good Sir John.
172: Lord Chief-Justice Sir John, you loiter here too long, being you are to
173: take soldiers up in counties as you go.
174: FALSTAFF: Will you sup with me, Master Gower?
175: Lord Chief-Justice What foolish master taught you these manners, Sir John?
176: Master Gower, if they become me not, he was a fool
177: that taught them me. This is the right fencing
178: grace, my lord; tap for tap, and so part fair.
179: Lord Chief-Justice Now the Lord lighten thee! thou art a great fool.
ACT 2 SCENE 2

1: PRINCE HENRY: Before God, I am exceeding weary.
2: POINS: Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst not
3: have attached one of so high blood.
4: PRINCE HENRY: Faith, it does me; though it discolours the
5: complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth
6: it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?
7: POINS: Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as
8: to remember so weak a composition.
9: PRINCE HENRY: Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,
10: by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,
11: small beer. But, indeed, these humble
12: considerations make me out of love with my
13: greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember
14: thy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to
15: take note how many pair of silk stockings thou
16: hast, viz. these, and those that were thy
17: peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy
18: shirts, as, one for superfluity, and another for
19: use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better
20: than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when
21: thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done
22: a great while, because the rest of thy low
23: countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:
24: and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruins
25: of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the
26: midwives say the children are not in the fault;
27: whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are
28: mightily strengthened.
29: POINS: How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,
30: you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good
31: young princes would do so, their fathers being so
32: sick as yours at this time is?
33: PRINCE HENRY: Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?
34: POINS: Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.
35: PRINCE HENRY: It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.
36: POINS: Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that you
37: will tell.
38: PRINCE HENRY: Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should be
39: sad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell
40: thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a
41: better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad
42: indeed too.
43: POINS: Very hardly upon such a subject.
44: PRINCE HENRY: By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's
45: book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and
46: persistency: let the end try the man. But I tell
47: thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so
48: sick: and keeping such vile company as thou art
49: hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.
50: POINS: The reason?
51: PRINCE HENRY: What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?
52: POINS: I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.
53: PRINCE HENRY: It would be every man's thought; and thou art a
54: blessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never
55: a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way
56: better than thine: every man would think me an
57: hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most
58: worshipful thought to think so?
59: POINS: Why, because you have been so lewd and so much
60: engraffed to Falstaff.
61: PRINCE HENRY: And to thee.
62: POINS: By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it
63: with my own ears: the worst that they can say of
64: me is that I am a second brother and that I am a
65: proper fellow of my hands; and those two things, I
66: confess, I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph.
67: PRINCE HENRY: And the boy that I gave Falstaff: a' had him from
68: me Christian; and look, if the fat villain have not
69: transformed him ape.
70: BARDOLPH: God save your grace!
71: PRINCE HENRY: And yours, most noble Bardolph!
72: BARDOLPH: Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must you
73: be blushing? wherefore blush you now? What a
74: maidenly man-at-arms are you become! Is't such a
75: matter to get a pottle-pot's maidenhead?
76: Page: A' calls me e'en now, my lord, through a red
77: lattice, and I could discern no part of his face
78: from the window: at last I spied his eyes, and
79: methought he had made two holes in the ale-wife's
80: new petticoat and so peeped through.
81: PRINCE HENRY: Has not the boy profited?
82: BARDOLPH: Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!
83: Page: Away, you rascally Althaea's dream, away!
84: PRINCE HENRY: Instruct us, boy; what dream, boy?
85: Page: Marry, my lord, Althaea dreamed she was delivered
86: of a fire-brand; and therefore I call him her dream.
87: PRINCE HENRY: A crown's worth of good interpretation: there 'tis,
88: boy.
89: POINS: O, that this good blossom could be kept from
90: cankers! Well, there is sixpence to preserve thee.
91: BARDOLPH: An you do not make him hanged among you, the
92: gallows shall have wrong.
93: PRINCE HENRY: And how doth thy master, Bardolph?
94: BARDOLPH: Well, my lord. He heard of your grace's coming to
95: town: there's a letter for you.
96: POINS: Delivered with good respect. And how doth the
97: martlemas, your master?
98: BARDOLPH: In bodily health, sir.
99: POINS: Marry, the immortal part needs a physician; but
100: that moves not him: though that be sick, it dies
101: not.
102: PRINCE HENRY: I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my
103: dog; and he holds his place; for look you how be writes.
104: POINS: [Reads] 'John Falstaff, knight,'--every man must
105: know that, as oft as he has occasion to name
106: himself: even like those that are kin to the king;
107: for they never prick their finger but they say,
108: 'There's some of the king's blood spilt.' 'How
109: comes that?' says he, that takes upon him not to
110: conceive. The answer is as ready as a borrower's
111: cap, 'I am the king's poor cousin, sir.'
112: PRINCE HENRY: Nay, they will be kin to us, or they will fetch it
113: from Japhet. But to the letter.
114: POINS: [Reads] 'Sir John Falstaff, knight, to the son of
115: the king, nearest his father, Harry Prince of
116: Wales, greeting.' Why, this is a certificate.
117: PRINCE HENRY: Peace!
118: POINS: [Reads] 'I will imitate the honourable Romans in
119: brevity:' he sure means brevity in breath,
120: short-winded. 'I commend me to thee, I commend
121: thee, and I leave thee. Be not too familiar with
122: Poins; for he misuses thy favours so much, that he
123: swears thou art to marry his sister Nell. Repent
124: at idle times as thou mayest; and so, farewell.
125: Thine, by yea and no, which is as much as to
126: say, as thou usest him, JACK FALSTAFF with my
127: familiars, JOHN with my brothers and sisters,
128: and SIR JOHN with all Europe.'
129: My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.
130: PRINCE HENRY: That's to make him eat twenty of his words. But do
131: you use me thus, Ned? must I marry your sister?
132: POINS: God send the wench no worse fortune! But I never said so.
133: PRINCE HENRY: Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and the
134: spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.
135: Is your master here in London?
136: BARDOLPH: Yea, my lord.
137: PRINCE HENRY: Where sups he? doth the old boar feed in the old frank?
138: BARDOLPH: At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.
139: PRINCE HENRY: What company?
140: Page: Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
141: PRINCE HENRY: Sup any women with him?
142: Page: None, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly and
143: Mistress Doll Tearsheet.
144: PRINCE HENRY: What pagan may that be?
145: Page: A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master's.
146: PRINCE HENRY: Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town
147: bull. Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?
148: POINS: I am your shadow, my lord; I'll follow you.
149: PRINCE HENRY: Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to your
150: master that I am yet come to town: there's for
151: your silence.
152: BARDOLPH: I have no tongue, sir.
153: Page: And for mine, sir, I will govern it.
154: PRINCE HENRY: Fare you well; go.
155: This Doll Tearsheet should be some road.
156: POINS: I warrant you, as common as the way between Saint
157: Alban's and London.
158: PRINCE HENRY: How might we see Falstaff bestow himself to-night
159: in his true colours, and not ourselves be seen?
160: POINS: Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and wait
161: upon him at his table as drawers.
162: PRINCE HENRY: From a God to a bull? a heavy decension! it was
163: Jove's case. From a prince to a prentice? a low
164: transformation! that shall be mine; for in every
165: thing the purpose must weigh with the folly.
166: Follow me, Ned.
ACT 2 SCENE 3

1: NORTHUMBERLAND: I pray thee, loving wife, and gentle daughter,
2: Give even way unto my rough affairs:
3: Put not you on the visage of the times
4: And be like them to Percy troublesome.
5: LADY
6: I have given over, I will speak no more:
7: Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.
8: Alas, sweet wife, my honour is at pawn;
9: And, but my going, nothing can redeem it.
10: LADY PERCY: O yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!
11: The time was, father, that you broke your word,
12: When you were more endeared to it than now;
13: When your own Percy, when my heart's dear Harry,
14: Threw many a northward look to see his father
15: Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.
16: Who then persuaded you to stay at home?
17: There were two honours lost, yours and your son's.
18: For yours, the God of heaven brighten it!
19: For his, it stuck upon him as the sun
20: In the grey vault of heaven, and by his light
21: Did all the chivalry of England move
22: To do brave acts: he was indeed the glass
23: Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves:
24: He had no legs that practised not his gait;
25: And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,
26: Became the accents of the valiant;
27: For those that could speak low and tardily
28: Would turn their own perfection to abuse,
29: To seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,
30: In diet, in affections of delight,
31: In military rules, humours of blood,
32: He was the mark and glass, copy and book,
33: That fashion'd others. And him, O wondrous him!
34: O miracle of men! him did you leave,
35: Second to none, unseconded by you,
36: To look upon the hideous god of war
37: In disadvantage; to abide a field
38: Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name
39: Did seem defensible: so you left him.
40: Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong
41: To hold your honour more precise and nice
42: With others than with him! let them alone:
43: The marshal and the archbishop are strong:
44: Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,
45: To-day might I, hanging on Hotspur's neck,
46: Have talk'd of Monmouth's grave.
47: NORTHUMBERLAND: Beshrew your heart,
48: Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from me
49: With new lamenting ancient oversights.
50: But I must go and meet with danger there,
51: Or it will seek me in another place
52: And find me worse provided.
53: LADY
54: O, fly to Scotland,
55: Till that the nobles and the armed commons
56: Have of their puissance made a little taste.
57: LADY PERCY: If they get ground and vantage of the king,
58: Then join you with them, like a rib of steel,
59: To make strength stronger; but, for all our loves,
60: First let them try themselves. So did your son;
61: He was so suffer'd: so came I a widow;
62: And never shall have length of life enough
63: To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes,
64: That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven,
65: For recordation to my noble husband.
66: NORTHUMBERLAND: Come, come, go in with me. 'Tis with my mind
67: As with the tide swell'd up unto his height,
68: That makes a still-stand, running neither way:
69: Fain would I go to meet the archbishop,
70: But many thousand reasons hold me back.
71: I will resolve for Scotland: there am I,
72: Till time and vantage crave my company.
ACT 2 SCENE 4

1: First Drawer: What the devil hast thou brought there? apple-johns?
2: thou knowest Sir John cannot endure an apple-john.
3: Second Drawer: Mass, thou sayest true. The prince once set a dish
4: of apple-johns before him, and told him there were
5: five more Sir Johns, and, putting off his hat, said
6: 'I will now take my leave of these six dry, round,
7: old, withered knights.' It angered him to the
8: heart: but he hath forgot that.
9: First Drawer: Why, then, cover, and set them down: and see if
10: thou canst find out Sneak's noise; Mistress
11: Tearsheet would fain hear some music. Dispatch: the
12: room where they supped is too hot; they'll come in straight.
13: Second Drawer: Sirrah, here will be the prince and Master Poins
14: anon; and they will put on two of our jerkins and
15: aprons; and Sir John must not know of it: Bardolph
16: hath brought word.
17: First Drawer: By the mass, here will be old Utis: it will be an
18: excellent stratagem.
19: Second Drawer: I'll see if I can find out Sneak.
20: MISTRESS QUICKLY: I' faith, sweetheart, methinks now you are in an
21: excellent good temperality: your pulsidge beats as
22: extraordinarily as heart would desire; and your
23: colour, I warrant you, is as red as any rose, in good
24: truth, la! But, i' faith, you have drunk too much
25: canaries; and that's a marvellous searching wine,
26: and it perfumes the blood ere one can say 'What's
27: this?' How do you now?
28: DOLL TEARSHEET: Better than I was: hem!
29: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Why, that's well said; a good heart's worth gold.
30: Lo, here comes Sir John.
31: FALSTAFF: [Singing] 'When Arthur first in court,'
32: --Empty the jordan.
33: --'And was a worthy king.' How now, Mistress Doll!
34: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Sick of a calm; yea, good faith.
35: FALSTAFF: So is all her sect; an they be once in a calm, they are sick.
36: DOLL TEARSHEET: You muddy rascal, is that all the comfort you give me?
37: FALSTAFF: You make fat rascals, Mistress Doll.
38: DOLL TEARSHEET: I make them! gluttony and diseases make them; I
39: make them not.
40: FALSTAFF: If the cook help to make the gluttony, you help to
41: make the diseases, Doll: we catch of you, Doll, we
42: catch of you; grant that, my poor virtue grant that.
43: DOLL TEARSHEET: Yea, joy, our chains and our jewels.
44: FALSTAFF: 'Your broaches, pearls, and ouches:' for to serve
45: bravely is to come halting off, you know: to come
46: off the breach with his pike bent bravely, and to
47: surgery bravely; to venture upon the charged
48: chambers bravely,--
49: DOLL TEARSHEET: Hang yourself, you muddy conger, hang yourself!
50: MISTRESS QUICKLY: By my troth, this is the old fashion; you two never
51: meet but you fall to some discord: you are both,
52: i' good truth, as rheumatic as two dry toasts; you
53: cannot one bear with another's confirmities. What
54: the good-year! one must bear, and that must be
55: you: you are the weaker vessel, as they say, the
56: emptier vessel.
57: DOLL TEARSHEET: Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full
58: hogshead? there's a whole merchant's venture of
59: Bourdeaux stuff in him; you have not seen a hulk
60: better stuffed in the hold. Come, I'll be friends
61: with thee, Jack: thou art going to the wars; and
62: whether I shall ever see thee again or no, there is
63: nobody cares.
64: First Drawer: Sir, Ancient Pistol's below, and would speak with
65: you.
66: DOLL TEARSHEET: Hang him, swaggering rascal! let him not come
67: hither: it is the foul-mouthed'st rogue in England.
68: MISTRESS QUICKLY: If he swagger, let him not come here: no, by my
69: faith; I must live among my neighbours: I'll no
70: swaggerers: I am in good name and fame with the
71: very best: shut the door; there comes no swaggerers
72: here: I have not lived all this while, to have
73: swaggering now: shut the door, I pray you.
74: FALSTAFF: Dost thou hear, hostess?
75: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Pray ye, pacify yourself, Sir John: there comes no
76: swaggerers here.
77: FALSTAFF: Dost thou hear? it is mine ancient.
78: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Tilly-fally, Sir John, ne'er tell me: your ancient
79: swaggerer comes not in my doors. I was before Master
80: Tisick, the debuty, t'other day; and, as he said to
81: me, 'twas no longer ago than Wednesday last, 'I'
82: good faith, neighbour Quickly,' says he; Master
83: Dumbe, our minister, was by then; 'neighbour
84: Quickly,' says he, 'receive those that are civil;
85: for,' said he, 'you are in an ill name:' now a'
86: said so, I can tell whereupon; 'for,' says he, 'you
87: are an honest woman, and well thought on; therefore
88: take heed what guests you receive: receive,' says
89: he, 'no swaggering companions.' There comes none
90: here: you would bless you to hear what he said:
91: no, I'll no swaggerers.
92: FALSTAFF: He's no swaggerer, hostess; a tame cheater, i'
93: faith; you may stroke him as gently as a puppy
94: greyhound: he'll not swagger with a Barbary hen, if
95: her feathers turn back in any show of resistance.
96: Call him up, drawer.
97: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Cheater, call you him? I will bar no honest man my
98: house, nor no cheater: but I do not love
99: swaggering, by my troth; I am the worse, when one
100: says swagger: feel, masters, how I shake; look you,
101: I warrant you.
102: DOLL TEARSHEET: So you do, hostess.
103: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Do I? yea, in very truth, do I, an 'twere an aspen
104: leaf: I cannot abide swaggerers.
105: PISTOL: God save you, Sir John!
106: FALSTAFF: Welcome, Ancient Pistol. Here, Pistol, I charge
107: you with a cup of sack: do you discharge upon mine hostess.
108: PISTOL: I will discharge upon her, Sir John, with two bullets.
109: FALSTAFF: She is Pistol-proof, sir; you shall hardly offend
110: her.
111: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Come, I'll drink no proofs nor no bullets: I'll
112: drink no more than will do me good, for no man's
113: pleasure, I.
114: PISTOL: Then to you, Mistress Dorothy; I will charge you.
115: DOLL TEARSHEET: Charge me! I scorn you, scurvy companion. What!
116: you poor, base, rascally, cheating, lack-linen
117: mate! Away, you mouldy rogue, away! I am meat for
118: your master.
119: PISTOL: I know you, Mistress Dorothy.
120: DOLL TEARSHEET: Away, you cut-purse rascal! you filthy bung, away!
121: by this wine, I'll thrust my knife in your mouldy
122: chaps, an you play the saucy cuttle with me. Away,
123: you bottle-ale rascal! you basket-hilt stale
124: juggler, you! Since when, I pray you, sir? God's
125: light, with two points on your shoulder? much!
126: PISTOL: God let me not live, but I will murder your ruff for this.
127: FALSTAFF: No more, Pistol; I would not have you go off here:
128: discharge yourself of our company, Pistol.
129: MISTRESS QUICKLY: No, Good Captain Pistol; not here, sweet captain.
130: DOLL TEARSHEET: Captain! thou abominable damned cheater, art thou
131: not ashamed to be called captain? An captains were
132: of my mind, they would truncheon you out, for
133: taking their names upon you before you have earned
134: them. You a captain! you slave, for what? for
135: tearing a poor whore's ruff in a bawdy-house? He a
136: captain! hang him, rogue! he lives upon mouldy
137: stewed prunes and dried cakes. A captain! God's
138: light, these villains will make the word as odious
139: as the word 'occupy;' which was an excellent good
140: word before it was ill sorted: therefore captains
141: had need look to 't.
142: BARDOLPH: Pray thee, go down, good ancient.
143: FALSTAFF: Hark thee hither, Mistress Doll.
144: PISTOL: Not I I tell thee what, Corporal Bardolph, I could
145: tear her: I'll be revenged of her.
146: Page: Pray thee, go down.
147: PISTOL: I'll see her damned first; to Pluto's damned lake,
148: by this hand, to the infernal deep, with Erebus and
149: tortures vile also. Hold hook and line, say I.
150: Down, down, dogs! down, faitors! Have we not
151: Hiren here?
152: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Good Captain Peesel, be quiet; 'tis very late, i'
153: faith: I beseek you now, aggravate your choler.
154: PISTOL: These be good humours, indeed! Shall pack-horses
155: And hollow pamper'd jades of Asia,
156: Which cannot go but thirty mile a-day,
157: Compare with Caesars, and with Cannibals,
158: And Trojan Greeks? nay, rather damn them with
159: King Cerberus; and let the welkin roar.
160: Shall we fall foul for toys?
161: MISTRESS QUICKLY: By my troth, captain, these are very bitter words.
162: BARDOLPH: Be gone, good ancient: this will grow to abrawl anon.
163: PISTOL: Die men like dogs! give crowns like pins! Have we
164: not Heren here?
165: MISTRESS QUICKLY: O' my word, captain, there's none such here. What
166: the good-year! do you think I would deny her? For
167: God's sake, be quiet.
168: PISTOL: Then feed, and be fat, my fair Calipolis.
169: Come, give's some sack.
170: 'Si fortune me tormente, sperato me contento.'
171: Fear we broadsides? no, let the fiend give fire:
172: Give me some sack: and, sweetheart, lie thou there.
173: Come we to full points here; and are etceteras nothing?
174: FALSTAFF: Pistol, I would be quiet.
175: PISTOL: Sweet knight, I kiss thy neaf: what! we have seen
176: the seven stars.
177: DOLL TEARSHEET: For God's sake, thrust him down stairs: I cannot
178: endure such a fustian rascal.
179: PISTOL: Thrust him down stairs! know we not Galloway nags?
180: FALSTAFF: Quoit him down, Bardolph, like a shove-groat
181: shilling: nay, an a' do nothing but speak nothing,
182: a' shall be nothing here.
183: BARDOLPH: Come, get you down stairs.
184: PISTOL: What! shall we have incision? shall we imbrue?
185: Then death rock me asleep, abridge my doleful days!
186: Why, then, let grievous, ghastly, gaping wounds
187: Untwine the Sisters Three! Come, Atropos, I say!
188: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Here's goodly stuff toward!
189: FALSTAFF: Give me my rapier, boy.
190: DOLL TEARSHEET: I pray thee, Jack, I pray thee, do not draw.
191: FALSTAFF: Get you down stairs.
192: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Here's a goodly tumult! I'll forswear keeping
193: house, afore I'll be in these tirrits and frights.
194: So; murder, I warrant now. Alas, alas! put up
195: your naked weapons, put up your naked weapons.
196: DOLL TEARSHEET: I pray thee, Jack, be quiet; the rascal's gone.
197: Ah, you whoreson little valiant villain, you!
198: MISTRESS QUICKLY: He you not hurt i' the groin? methought a' made a
199: shrewd thrust at your belly.
200: FALSTAFF: Have you turned him out o' doors?
201: BARDOLPH: Yea, sir. The rascal's drunk: you have hurt him,
202: sir, i' the shoulder.
203: FALSTAFF: A rascal! to brave me!
204: DOLL TEARSHEET: Ah, you sweet little rogue, you! alas, poor ape,
205: how thou sweatest! come, let me wipe thy face;
206: come on, you whoreson chops: ah, rogue! i'faith, I
207: love thee: thou art as valorous as Hector of Troy,
208: worth five of Agamemnon, and ten times better than
209: the Nine Worthies: ah, villain!
210: FALSTAFF: A rascally slave! I will toss the rogue in a blanket.
211: DOLL TEARSHEET: Do, an thou darest for thy heart: an thou dost,
212: I'll canvass thee between a pair of sheets.
213: Page: The music is come, sir.
214: FALSTAFF: Let them play. Play, sirs. Sit on my knee, Doll.
215: A rascal bragging slave! the rogue fled from me
216: like quicksilver.
217: DOLL TEARSHEET: I' faith, and thou followedst him like a church.
218: Thou whoreson little tidy Bartholomew boar-pig,
219: when wilt thou leave fighting o' days and foining
220: o' nights, and begin to patch up thine old body for heaven?
221: FALSTAFF: Peace, good Doll! do not speak like a death's-head;
222: do not bid me remember mine end.
223: DOLL TEARSHEET: Sirrah, what humour's the prince of?
224: FALSTAFF: A good shallow young fellow: a' would have made a
225: good pantler, a' would ha' chipp'd bread well.
226: DOLL TEARSHEET: They say Poins has a good wit.
227: FALSTAFF: He a good wit? hang him, baboon! his wit's as thick
228: as Tewksbury mustard; there's no more conceit in him
229: than is in a mallet.
230: DOLL TEARSHEET: Why does the prince love him so, then?
231: FALSTAFF: Because their legs are both of a bigness, and a'
232: plays at quoits well, and eats conger and fennel,
233: and drinks off candles' ends for flap-dragons, and
234: rides the wild-mare with the boys, and jumps upon
235: joined-stools, and swears with a good grace, and
236: wears his boots very smooth, like unto the sign of
237: the leg, and breeds no bate with telling of discreet
238: stories; and such other gambol faculties a' has,
239: that show a weak mind and an able body, for the
240: which the prince admits him: for the prince himself
241: is such another; the weight of a hair will turn the
242: scales between their avoirdupois.
243: PRINCE HENRY: Would not this nave of a wheel have his ears cut off?
244: POINS: Let's beat him before his whore.
245: PRINCE HENRY: Look, whether the withered elder hath not his poll
246: clawed like a parrot.
247: POINS: Is it not strange that desire should so many years
248: outlive performance?
249: FALSTAFF: Kiss me, Doll.
250: PRINCE HENRY: Saturn and Venus this year in conjunction! what
251: says the almanac to that?
252: POINS: And look, whether the fiery Trigon, his man, be not
253: lisping to his master's old tables, his note-book,
254: his counsel-keeper.
255: FALSTAFF: Thou dost give me flattering busses.
256: DOLL TEARSHEET: By my troth, I kiss thee with a most constant heart.
257: FALSTAFF: I am old, I am old.
258: DOLL TEARSHEET: I love thee better than I love e'er a scurvy young
259: boy of them all.
260: FALSTAFF: What stuff wilt have a kirtle of? I shall receive
261: money o' Thursday: shalt have a cap to-morrow. A
262: merry song, come: it grows late; we'll to bed.
263: Thou'lt forget me when I am gone.
264: DOLL TEARSHEET: By my troth, thou'lt set me a-weeping, an thou
265: sayest so: prove that ever I dress myself handsome
266: till thy return: well, harken at the end.
267: FALSTAFF: Some sack, Francis.
268: POINS: Anon, anon, sir.
269: FALSTAFF: Ha! a bastard son of the king's? And art not thou
270: Poins his brother?
271: PRINCE HENRY: Why, thou globe of sinful continents! what a life
272: dost thou lead!
273: FALSTAFF: A better than thou: I am a gentleman; thou art a drawer.
274: PRINCE HENRY: Very true, sir; and I come to draw you out by the ears.
275: MISTRESS QUICKLY: O, the Lord preserve thy good grace! by my troth,
276: welcome to London. Now, the Lord bless that sweet
277: face of thine! O, Jesu, are you come from Wales?
278: FALSTAFF: Thou whoreson mad compound of majesty, by this light
279: flesh and corrupt blood, thou art welcome.
280: DOLL TEARSHEET: How, you fat fool! I scorn you.
281: POINS: My lord, he will drive you out of your revenge and
282: turn all to a merriment, if you take not the heat.
283: PRINCE HENRY: You whoreson candle-mine, you, how vilely did you
284: speak of me even now before this honest, virtuous,
285: civil gentlewoman!
286: MISTRESS QUICKLY: God's blessing of your good heart! and so she is,
287: by my troth.
288: FALSTAFF: Didst thou hear me?
289: PRINCE HENRY: Yea, and you knew me, as you did when you ran away
290: by Gad's-hill: you knew I was at your back, and
291: spoke it on purpose to try my patience.
292: FALSTAFF: No, no, no; not so; I did not think thou wast within hearing.
293: PRINCE HENRY: I shall drive you then to confess the wilful abuse;
294: and then I know how to handle you.
295: FALSTAFF: No abuse, Hal, o' mine honour, no abuse.
296: PRINCE HENRY: Not to dispraise me, and call me pantier and
297: bread-chipper and I know not what?
298: FALSTAFF: No abuse, Hal.
299: POINS: No abuse?
300: FALSTAFF: No abuse, Ned, i' the world; honest Ned, none. I
301: dispraised him before the wicked, that the wicked
302: might not fall in love with him; in which doing, I
303: have done the part of a careful friend and a true
304: subject, and thy father is to give me thanks for it.
305: No abuse, Hal: none, Ned, none: no, faith, boys, none.
306: PRINCE HENRY: See now, whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth
307: not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to
308: close with us? is she of the wicked? is thine
309: hostess here of the wicked? or is thy boy of the
310: wicked? or honest Bardolph, whose zeal burns in his
311: nose, of the wicked?
312: POINS: Answer, thou dead elm, answer.
313: FALSTAFF: The fiend hath pricked down Bardolph irrecoverable;
314: and his face is Lucifer's privy-kitchen, where he
315: doth nothing but roast malt-worms. For the boy,
316: there is a good angel about him; but the devil
317: outbids him too.
318: PRINCE HENRY: For the women?
319: FALSTAFF: For one of them, she is in hell already, and burns
320: poor souls. For the other, I owe her money, and
321: whether she be damned for that, I know not.
322: MISTRESS QUICKLY: No, I warrant you.
323: FALSTAFF: No, I think thou art not; I think thou art quit for
324: that. Marry, there is another indictment upon thee,
325: for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house,
326: contrary to the law; for the which I think thou wilt howl.
327: MISTRESS QUICKLY: All victuallers do so; what's a joint of mutton or
328: two in a whole Lent?
329: PRINCE HENRY: You, gentlewoman,-
330: DOLL TEARSHEET: What says your grace?
331: FALSTAFF: His grace says that which his flesh rebels against.
332: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Who knocks so loud at door? Look to the door there, Francis.
333: PRINCE HENRY: Peto, how now! what news?
334: PETO: The king your father is at Westminster:
335: And there are twenty weak and wearied posts
336: Come from the north: and, as I came along,
337: I met and overtook a dozen captains,
338: Bare-headed, sweating, knocking at the taverns,
339: And asking every one for Sir John Falstaff.
340: PRINCE HENRY: By heaven, Poins, I feel me much to blame,
341: So idly to profane the precious time,
342: When tempest of commotion, like the south
343: Borne with black vapour, doth begin to melt
344: And drop upon our bare unarmed heads.
345: Give me my sword and cloak. Falstaff, good night.
346: FALSTAFF: Now comes in the sweetest morsel of the night, and
347: we must hence and leave it unpicked.
348: More knocking at the door!
349: How now! what's the matter?
350: BARDOLPH: You must away to court, sir, presently;
351: A dozen captains stay at door for you.
352: FALSTAFF: [To the Page] Pay the musicians, sirrah. Farewell,
353: hostess; farewell, Doll. You see, my good wenches,
354: how men of merit are sought after: the undeserver
355: may sleep, when the man of action is called on.
356: Farewell good wenches: if I be not sent away post,
357: I will see you again ere I go.
358: DOLL TEARSHEET: I cannot speak; if my heart be not read to burst,--
359: well, sweet Jack, have a care of thyself.
360: FALSTAFF: Farewell, farewell.
361: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Well, fare thee well: I have known thee these
362: twenty-nine years, come peascod-time; but an
363: honester and truer-hearted man,--well, fare thee well.
364: BARDOLPH: [Within] Mistress Tearsheet!
365: MISTRESS QUICKLY: What's the matter?
366: BARDOLPH: [Within] Good Mistress Tearsheet, come to my master.
ACT 3 SCENE 1

1: KING HENRY IV: Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick;
2: But, ere they come, bid them o'er-read these letters,
3: And well consider of them; make good speed.
4: How many thousand of my poorest subjects
5: Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,
6: Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,
7: That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down
8: And steep my senses in forgetfulness?
9: Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,
10: Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee
11: And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,
12: Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,
13: Under the canopies of costly state,
14: And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody?
15: O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile
16: In loathsome beds, and leavest the kingly couch
17: A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?
18: Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
19: Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains
20: In cradle of the rude imperious surge
21: And in the visitation of the winds,
22: Who take the ruffian billows by the top,
23: Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
24: With deafening clamour in the slippery clouds,
25: That, with the hurly, death itself awakes?
26: Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose
27: To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,
28: And in the calmest and most stillest night,
29: With all appliances and means to boot,
30: Deny it to a king? Then happy low, lie down!
31: Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
32: WARWICK: Many good morrows to your majesty!
33: KING HENRY IV: Is it good morrow, lords?
34: WARWICK: 'Tis one o'clock, and past.
35: KING HENRY IV: Why, then, good morrow to you all, my lords.
36: Have you read o'er the letters that I sent you?
37: WARWICK: We have, my liege.
38: KING HENRY IV: Then you perceive the body of our kingdom
39: How foul it is; what rank diseases grow
40: And with what danger, near the heart of it.
41: WARWICK: It is but as a body yet distemper'd;
42: Which to his former strength may be restored
43: With good advice and little medicine:
44: My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool'd.
45: KING HENRY IV: O God! that one might read the book of fate,
46: And see the revolution of the times
47: Make mountains level, and the continent,
48: Weary of solid firmness, melt itself
49: Into the sea! and, other times, to see
50: The beachy girdle of the ocean
51: Too wide for Neptune's hips; how chances mock,
52: And changes fill the cup of alteration
53: With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,
54: The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,
55: What perils past, what crosses to ensue,
56: Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.
57: 'Tis not 'ten years gone
58: Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,
59: Did feast together, and in two years after
60: Were they at wars: it is but eight years since
61: This Percy was the man nearest my soul,
62: Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs
63: And laid his love and life under my foot,
64: Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard
65: Gave him defiance. But which of you was by--
66: You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember--
67: When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,
68: Then cheque'd and rated by Northumberland,
69: Did speak these words, now proved a prophecy?
70: 'Northumberland, thou ladder by the which
71: My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne;'
72: Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,
73: But that necessity so bow'd the state
74: That I and greatness were compell'd to kiss:
75: 'The time shall come,' thus did he follow it,
76: 'The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,
77: Shall break into corruption:' so went on,
78: Foretelling this same time's condition
79: And the division of our amity.
80: WARWICK: There is a history in all men's lives,
81: Figuring the nature of the times deceased;
82: The which observed, a man may prophesy,
83: With a near aim, of the main chance of things
84: As yet not come to life, which in their seeds
85: And weak beginnings lie intreasured.
86: Such things become the hatch and brood of time;
87: And by the necessary form of this
88: King Richard might create a perfect guess
89: That great Northumberland, then false to him,
90: Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness;
91: Which should not find a ground to root upon,
92: Unless on you.
93: KING HENRY IV: Are these things then necessities?
94: Then let us meet them like necessities:
95: And that same word even now cries out on us:
96: They say the bishop and Northumberland
97: Are fifty thousand strong.
98: WARWICK: It cannot be, my lord;
99: Rumour doth double, like the voice and echo,
100: The numbers of the fear'd. Please it your grace
101: To go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord,
102: The powers that you already have sent forth
103: Shall bring this prize in very easily.
104: To comfort you the more, I have received
105: A certain instance that Glendower is dead.
106: Your majesty hath been this fortnight ill,
107: And these unseason'd hours perforce must add
108: Unto your sickness.
109: KING HENRY IV: I will take your counsel:
110: And were these inward wars once out of hand,
111: We would, dear lords, unto the Holy Land.
ACT 3 SCENE 2

1: SHALLOW: Come on, come on, come on, sir; give me your hand,
2: sir, give me your hand, sir: an early stirrer, by
3: the rood! And how doth my good cousin Silence?
4: SILENCE: Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.
5: SHALLOW: And how doth my cousin, your bedfellow? and your
6: fairest daughter and mine, my god-daughter Ellen?
7: SILENCE: Alas, a black ousel, cousin Shallow!
8: SHALLOW: By yea and nay, sir, I dare say my cousin William is
9: become a good scholar: he is at Oxford still, is he not?
10: SILENCE: Indeed, sir, to my cost.
11: SHALLOW: A' must, then, to the inns o' court shortly. I was
12: once of Clement's Inn, where I think they will
13: talk of mad Shallow yet.
14: SILENCE: You were called 'lusty Shallow' then, cousin.
15: SHALLOW: By the mass, I was called any thing; and I would
16: have done any thing indeed too, and roundly too.
17: There was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire,
18: and black George Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, and
19: Will Squele, a Cotswold man; you had not four such
20: swinge-bucklers in all the inns o' court again: and
21: I may say to you, we knew where the bona-robas were
22: and had the best of them all at commandment. Then
23: was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy, and page to
24: Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.
25: SILENCE: This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about soldiers?
26: SHALLOW: The same Sir John, the very same. I see him break
27: Skogan's head at the court-gate, when a' was a
28: crack not thus high: and the very same day did I
29: fight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer,
30: behind Gray's Inn. Jesu, Jesu, the mad days that I
31: have spent! and to see how many of my old
32: acquaintance are dead!
33: SILENCE: We shall all follow, cousin.
34: SHADOW: Certain, 'tis certain; very sure, very sure: death,
35: as the Psalmist saith, is certain to all; all shall
36: die. How a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford fair?
37: SILENCE: By my troth, I was not there.
38: SHALLOW: Death is certain. Is old Double of your town living
39: yet?
40: SILENCE: Dead, sir.
41: SHALLOW: Jesu, Jesu, dead! a' drew a good bow; and dead! a'
42: shot a fine shoot: John a Gaunt loved him well, and
43: betted much money on his head. Dead! a' would have
44: clapped i' the clout at twelve score; and carried
45: you a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen and a
46: half, that it would have done a man's heart good to
47: see. How a score of ewes now?
48: SILENCE: Thereafter as they be: a score of good ewes may be
49: worth ten pounds.
50: SHALLOW: And is old Double dead?
51: SILENCE: Here come two of Sir John Falstaff's men, as I think.
52: BARDOLPH: Good morrow, honest gentlemen: I beseech you, which
53: is Justice Shallow?
54: SHALLOW: I am Robert Shallow, sir; a poor esquire of this
55: county, and one of the king's justices of th e peace:
56: What is your good pleasure with me?
57: BARDOLPH: My captain, sir, commends him to you; my captain,
58: Sir John Falstaff, a tall gentleman, by heaven, and
59: a most gallant leader.
60: SHALLOW: He greets me well, sir. I knew him a good backsword
61: man. How doth the good knight? may I ask how my
62: lady his wife doth?
63: BARDOLPH: Sir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated than
64: with a wife.
65: SHALLOW: It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well said
66: indeed too. Better accommodated! it is good; yea,
67: indeed, is it: good phrases are surely, and ever
68: were, very commendable. Accommodated! it comes of
69: 'accommodo' very good; a good phrase.
70: BARDOLPH: Pardon me, sir; I have heard the word. Phrase call
71: you it? by this good day, I know not the phrase;
72: but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a
73: soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good
74: command, by heaven. Accommodated; that is, when a
75: man is, as they say, accommodated; or when a man is,
76: being, whereby a' may be thought to be accommodated;
77: which is an excellent thing.
78: SHALLOW: It is very just.
79: Look, here comes good Sir John. Give me your good
80: hand, give me your worship's good hand: by my
81: troth, you like well and bear your years very well:
82: welcome, good Sir John.
83: FALSTAFF: I am glad to see you well, good Master Robert
84: Shallow: Master Surecard, as I think?
85: SHALLOW: No, Sir John; it is my cousin Silence, in commission with me.
86: FALSTAFF: Good Master Silence, it well befits you should be of
87: the peace.
88: SILENCE: Your good-worship is welcome.
89: FALSTAFF: Fie! this is hot weather, gentlemen. Have you
90: provided me here half a dozen sufficient men?
91: SHALLOW: Marry, have we, sir. Will you sit?
92: FALSTAFF: Let me see them, I beseech you.
93: SHALLOW: Where's the roll? where's the roll? where's the
94: roll? Let me see, let me see, let me see. So, so:
95: yea, marry, sir: Ralph Mouldy! Let them appear as
96: I call; let them do so, let them do so. Let me
97: see; where is Mouldy?
98: MOULDY: Here, an't please you.
99: SHALLOW: What think you, Sir John? a good-limbed fellow;
100: young, strong, and of good friends.
101: FALSTAFF: Is thy name Mouldy?
102: MOULDY: Yea, an't please you.
103: FALSTAFF: 'Tis the more time thou wert used.
104: SHALLOW: Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i' faith! Things that
105: are mouldy lack use: very singular good! in faith,
106: well said, Sir John, very well said.
107: FALSTAFF: Prick him.
108: MOULDY: I was pricked well enough before, an you could have
109: let me alone: my old dame will be undone now for
110: one to do her husbandry and her drudgery: you need
111: not to have pricked me; there are other men fitter
112: to go out than I.
113: FALSTAFF: Go to: peace, Mouldy; you shall go. Mouldy, it is
114: time you were spent.
115: MOULDY: Spent!
116: SHALLOW: Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside: know you where
117: you are? For the other, Sir John: let me see:
118: Simon Shadow!
119: FALSTAFF: Yea, marry, let me have him to sit under: he's like
120: to be a cold soldier.
121: SHALLOW: Where's Shadow?
122: SHADOW: Here, sir.
123: FALSTAFF: Shadow, whose son art thou?
124: SHADOW: My mother's son, sir.
125: FALSTAFF: Thy mother's son! like enough, and thy father's
126: shadow: so the son of the female is the shadow of
127: the male: it is often so, indeed; but much of the
128: father's substance!
129: SHALLOW: Do you like him, Sir John?
130: FALSTAFF: Shadow will serve for summer; prick him, for we have
131: a number of shadows to fill up the muster-book.
132: SHALLOW: Thomas Wart!
133: FALSTAFF: Where's he?
134: WART: Here, sir.
135: FALSTAFF: Is thy name Wart?
136: WART: Yea, sir.
137: FALSTAFF: Thou art a very ragged wart.
138: SHALLOW: Shall I prick him down, Sir John?
139: FALSTAFF: It were superfluous; for his apparel is built upon
140: his back and the whole frame stands upon pins:
141: prick him no more.
142: SHALLOW: Ha, ha, ha! you can do it, sir; you can do it: I
143: commend you well. Francis Feeble!
144: FEEBLE: Here, sir.
145: FALSTAFF: What trade art thou, Feeble?
146: FEEBLE: A woman's tailor, sir.
147: SHALLOW: Shall I prick him, sir?
148: FALSTAFF: You may: but if he had been a man's tailor, he'ld
149: ha' pricked you. Wilt thou make as many holes in
150: an enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?
151: FEEBLE: I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.
152: FALSTAFF: Well said, good woman's tailor! well said,
153: courageous Feeble! thou wilt be as valiant as the
154: wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick the
155: woman's tailor: well, Master Shallow; deep, Master Shallow.
156: FEEBLE: I would Wart might have gone, sir.
157: FALSTAFF: I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightst
158: mend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him
159: to a private soldier that is the leader of so many
160: thousands: let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.
161: FEEBLE: It shall suffice, sir.
162: FALSTAFF: I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble. Who is next?
163: SHALLOW: Peter Bullcalf o' the green!
164: FALSTAFF: Yea, marry, let's see Bullcalf.
165: BULLCALF: Here, sir.
166: FALSTAFF: 'Fore God, a likely fellow! Come, prick me Bullcalf
167: till he roar again.
168: BULLCALF: O Lord! good my lord captain,--
169: FALSTAFF: What, dost thou roar before thou art pricked?
170: BULLCALF: O Lord, sir! I am a diseased man.
171: FALSTAFF: What disease hast thou?
172: BULLCALF: A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught
173: with ringing in the king's affairs upon his
174: coronation-day, sir.
175: FALSTAFF: Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown; we wilt
176: have away thy cold; and I will take such order that
177: my friends shall ring for thee. Is here all?
178: SHALLOW: Here is two more called than your number, you must
179: have but four here, sir: and so, I pray you, go in
180: with me to dinner.
181: FALSTAFF: Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry
182: dinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.
183: SHALLOW: O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night
184: in the windmill in Saint George's field?
185: FALSTAFF: No more of that, good Master Shallow, no more of that.
186: SHALLOW: Ha! 'twas a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork alive?
187: FALSTAFF: She lives, Master Shallow.
188: SHALLOW: She never could away with me.
189: FALSTAFF: Never, never; she would always say she could not
190: abide Master Shallow.
191: SHALLOW: By the mass, I could anger her to the heart. She
192: was then a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own well?
193: FALSTAFF: Old, old, Master Shallow.
194: SHALLOW: Nay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be old;
195: certain she's old; and had Robin Nightwork by old
196: Nightwork before I came to Clement's Inn.
197: SILENCE: That's fifty-five year ago.
198: SHALLOW: Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that
199: this knight and I have seen! Ha, Sir John, said I well?
200: FALSTAFF: We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.
201: SHALLOW: That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith,
202: Sir John, we have: our watch-word was 'Hem boys!'
203: Come, let's to dinner; come, let's to dinner:
204: Jesus, the days that we have seen! Come, come.
205: BULLCALF: Good Master Corporate Bardolph, stand my friend;
206: and here's four Harry ten shillings in French crowns
207: for you. In very truth, sir, I had as lief be
208: hanged, sir, as go: and yet, for mine own part, sir,
209: I do not care; but rather, because I am unwilling,
210: and, for mine own part, have a desire to stay with
211: my friends; else, sir, I did not care, for mine own
212: part, so much.
213: BARDOLPH: Go to; stand aside.
214: MOULDY: And, good master corporal captain, for my old
215: dame's sake, stand my friend: she has nobody to do
216: any thing about her when I am gone; and she is old,
217: and cannot help herself: You shall have forty, sir.
218: BARDOLPH: Go to; stand aside.
219: FEEBLE: By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once: we
220: owe God a death: I'll ne'er bear a base mind:
221: an't be my destiny, so; an't be not, so: no man is
222: too good to serve's prince; and let it go which way
223: it will, he that dies this year is quit for the next.
224: BARDOLPH: Well said; thou'rt a good fellow.
225: FEEBLE: Faith, I'll bear no base mind.
226: FALSTAFF: Come, sir, which men shall I have?
227: SHALLOW: Four of which you please.
228: BARDOLPH: Sir, a word with you: I have three pound to free
229: Mouldy and Bullcalf.
230: FALSTAFF: Go to; well.
231: SHALLOW: Come, Sir John, which four will you have?
232: FALSTAFF: Do you choose for me.
233: SHALLOW: Marry, then, Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble and Shadow.
234: FALSTAFF: Mouldy and Bullcalf: for you, Mouldy, stay at home
235: till you are past service: and for your part,
236: Bullcalf, grow till you come unto it: I will none of you.
237: SHALLOW: Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong: they are
238: your likeliest men, and I would have you served with the best.
239: FALSTAFF: Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a
240: man? Care I for the limb, the thewes, the stature,
241: bulk, and big assemblance of a man! Give me the
242: spirit, Master Shallow. Here's Wart; you see what a
243: ragged appearance it is; a' shall charge you and
244: discharge you with the motion of a pewterer's
245: hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets
246: on the brewer's bucket. And this same half-faced
247: fellow, Shadow; give me this man: he presents no
248: mark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aim
249: level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat;
250: how swiftly will this Feeble the woman's tailor run
251: off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the
252: great ones. Put me a caliver into Wart's hand, Bardolph.
253: BARDOLPH: Hold, Wart, traverse; thus, thus, thus.
254: FALSTAFF: Come, manage me your caliver. So: very well: go
255: to: very good, exceeding good. O, give me always a
256: little, lean, old, chapt, bald shot. Well said, i'
257: faith, Wart; thou'rt a good scab: hold, there's a
258: tester for thee.
259: SHALLOW: He is not his craft's master; he doth not do it
260: right. I remember at Mile-end Green, when I lay at
261: Clement's Inn--I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's
262: show,--there was a little quiver fellow, and a'
263: would manage you his piece thus; and a' would about
264: and about, and come you in and come you in: 'rah,
265: tah, tah,' would a' say; 'bounce' would a' say; and
266: away again would a' go, and again would a' come: I
267: shall ne'er see such a fellow.
268: FALSTAFF: These fellows will do well, Master Shallow. God
269: keep you, Master Silence: I will not use many words
270: with you. Fare you well, gentlemen both: I thank
271: you: I must a dozen mile to-night. Bardolph, give
272: the soldiers coats.
273: SHALLOW: Sir John, the Lord bless you! God prosper your
274: affairs! God send us peace! At your return visit
275: our house; let our old acquaintance be renewed;
276: peradventure I will with ye to the court.
277: FALSTAFF: 'Fore God, I would you would, Master Shallow.
278: SHALLOW: Go to; I have spoke at a word. God keep you.
ACT 4 SCENE 1

1: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: What is this forest call'd?
2: HASTINGS: 'Tis Gaultree Forest, an't shall please your grace.
3: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: Here stand, my lords; and send discoverers forth
4: To know the numbers of our enemies.
5: HASTINGS: We have sent forth already.
6: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: 'Tis well done.
7: My friends and brethren in these great affairs,
8: I must acquaint you that I have received
9: New-dated letters from Northumberland;
10: Their cold intent, tenor and substance, thus:
11: Here doth he wish his person, with such powers
12: As might hold sortance with his quality,
13: The which he could not levy; whereupon
14: He is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,
15: To Scotland: and concludes in hearty prayers
16: That your attempts may overlive the hazard
17: And fearful melting of their opposite.
18: MOWBRAY: Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
19: And dash themselves to pieces.
20: HASTINGS: Now, what news?
21: Messenger: West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,
22: In goodly form comes on the enemy;
23: And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number
24: Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand.
25: MOWBRAY: The just proportion that we gave them out
26: Let us sway on and face them in the field.
27: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: What well-appointed leader fronts us here?
28: MOWBRAY: I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.
29: WESTMORELAND: Health and fair greeting from our general,
30: The prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.
31: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace:
32: What doth concern your coming?
33: WESTMORELAND: Then, my lord,
34: Unto your grace do I in chief address
35: The substance of my speech. If that rebellion
36: Came like itself, in base and abject routs,
37: Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,
38: And countenanced by boys and beggary,
39: I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,
40: In his true, native and most proper shape,
41: You, reverend father, and these noble lords
42: Had not been here, to dress the ugly form
43: Of base and bloody insurrection
44: With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,
45: Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,
46: Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,
47: Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,
48: Whose white investments figure innocence,
49: The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,
50: Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself
51: Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,
52: Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;
53: Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,
54: Your pens to lances and your tongue divine
55: To a trumpet and a point of war?
56: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.
57: Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,
58: And with our surfeiting and wanton hours
59: Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,
60: And we must bleed for it; of which disease
61: Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.
62: But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,
63: I take not on me here as a physician,
64: Nor do I as an enemy to peace
65: Troop in the throngs of military men;
66: But rather show awhile like fearful war,
67: To diet rank minds sick of happiness
68: And purge the obstructions which begin to stop
69: Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.
70: I have in equal balance justly weigh'd
71: What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,
72: And find our griefs heavier than our offences.
73: We see which way the stream of time doth run,
74: And are enforced from our most quiet there
75: By the rough torrent of occasion;
76: And have the summary of all our griefs,
77: When time shall serve, to show in articles;
78: Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,
79: And might by no suit gain our audience:
80: When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,
81: We are denied access unto his person
82: Even by those men that most have done us wrong.
83: The dangers of the days but newly gone,
84: Whose memory is written on the earth
85: With yet appearing blood, and the examples
86: Of every minute's instance, present now,
87: Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,
88: Not to break peace or any branch of it,
89: But to establish here a peace indeed,
90: Concurring both in name and quality.
91: WESTMORELAND: When ever yet was your appeal denied?
92: Wherein have you been galled by the king?
93: What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,
94: That you should seal this lawless bloody book
95: Of forged rebellion with a seal divine
96: And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?
97: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: My brother general, the commonwealth,
98: To brother born an household cruelty,
99: I make my quarrel in particular.
100: WESTMORELAND: There is no need of any such redress;
101: Or if there were, it not belongs to you.
102: MOWBRAY: Why not to him in part, and to us all
103: That feel the bruises of the days before,
104: And suffer the condition of these times
105: To lay a heavy and unequal hand
106: Upon our honours?
107: WESTMORELAND: O, my good Lord Mowbray,
108: Construe the times to their necessities,
109: And you shall say indeed, it is the time,
110: And not the king, that doth you injuries.
111: Yet for your part, it not appears to me
112: Either from the king or in the present time
113: That you should have an inch of any ground
114: To build a grief on: were you not restored
115: To all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,
116: Your noble and right well remember'd father's?
117: MOWBRAY: What thing, in honour, had my father lost,
118: That need to be revived and breathed in me?
119: The king that loved him, as the state stood then,
120: Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:
121: And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,
122: Being mounted and both roused in their seats,
123: Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,
124: Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,
125: Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel
126: And the loud trumpet blowing them together,
127: Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd
128: My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,
129: O when the king did throw his warder down,
130: His own life hung upon the staff he threw;
131: Then threw he down himself and all their lives
132: That by indictment and by dint of sword
133: Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.
134: WESTMORELAND: You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.
135: The Earl of Hereford was reputed then
136: In England the most valiant gentlemen:
137: Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?
138: But if your father had been victor there,
139: He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:
140: For all the country in a general voice
141: Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love
142: Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on
143: And bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king.
144: But this is mere digression from my purpose.
145: Here come I from our princely general
146: To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace
147: That he will give you audience; and wherein
148: It shall appear that your demands are just,
149: You shall enjoy them, every thing set off
150: That might so much as think you enemies.
151: MOWBRAY: But he hath forced us to compel this offer;
152: And it proceeds from policy, not love.
153: WESTMORELAND: Mowbray, you overween to take it so;
154: This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:
155: For, lo! within a ken our army lies,
156: Upon mine honour, all too confident
157: To give admittance to a thought of fear.
158: Our battle is more full of names than yours,
159: Our men more perfect in the use of arms,
160: Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;
161: Then reason will our heart should be as good
162: Say you not then our offer is compell'd.
163: MOWBRAY: Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.
164: WESTMORELAND: That argues but the shame of your offence:
165: A rotten case abides no handling.
166: HASTINGS: Hath the Prince John a full commission,
167: In very ample virtue of his father,
168: To hear and absolutely to determine
169: Of what conditions we shall stand upon?
170: WESTMORELAND: That is intended in the general's name:
171: I muse you make so slight a question.
172: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,
173: For this contains our general grievances:
174: Each several article herein redress'd,
175: All members of our cause, both here and hence,
176: That are insinew'd to this action,
177: Acquitted by a true substantial form
178: And present execution of our wills
179: To us and to our purposes confined,
180: We come within our awful banks again
181: And knit our powers to the arm of peace.
182: WESTMORELAND: This will I show the general. Please you, lords,
183: In sight of both our battles we may meet;
184: And either end in peace, which God so frame!
185: Or to the place of difference call the swords
186: Which must decide it.
187: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: My lord, we will do so.
188: MOWBRAY: There is a thing within my bosom tells me
189: That no conditions of our peace can stand.
190: HASTINGS: Fear you not that: if we can make our peace
191: Upon such large terms and so absolute
192: As our conditions shall consist upon,
193: Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.
194: MOWBRAY: Yea, but our valuation shall be such
195: That every slight and false-derived cause,
196: Yea, every idle, nice and wanton reason
197: Shall to the king taste of this action;
198: That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,
199: We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind
200: That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff
201: And good from bad find no partition.
202: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary
203: Of dainty and such picking grievances:
204: For he hath found to end one doubt by death
205: Revives two greater in the heirs of life,
206: And therefore will he wipe his tables clean
207: And keep no tell-tale to his memory
208: That may repeat and history his loss
209: To new remembrance; for full well he knows
210: He cannot so precisely weed this land
211: As his misdoubts present occasion:
212: His foes are so enrooted with his friends
213: That, plucking to unfix an enemy,
214: He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:
215: So that this land, like an offensive wife
216: That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,
217: As he is striking, holds his infant up
218: And hangs resolved correction in the arm
219: That was uprear'd to execution.
220: HASTINGS: Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods
221: On late offenders, that he now doth lack
222: The very instruments of chastisement:
223: So that his power, like to a fangless lion,
224: May offer, but not hold.
225: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: 'Tis very true:
226: And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,
227: If we do now make our atonement well,
228: Our peace will, like a broken limb united,
229: Grow stronger for the breaking.
230: MOWBRAY: Be it so.
231: Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland.
232: WESTMORELAND: The prince is here at hand: pleaseth your lordship
233: To meet his grace just distance 'tween our armies.
234: MOWBRAY: Your grace of York, in God's name then, set forward.
235: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: Before, and greet his grace: my lord, we come.
ACT 4 SCENE 2

1: LANCASTER: You are well encounter'd here, my cousin Mowbray:
2: Good day to you, gentle lord archbishop;
3: And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.
4: My Lord of York, it better show'd with you
5: When that your flock, assembled by the bell,
6: Encircled you to hear with reverence
7: Your exposition on the holy text
8: Than now to see you here an iron man,
9: Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,
10: Turning the word to sword and life to death.
11: That man that sits within a monarch's heart,
12: And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,
13: Would he abuse the countenance of the king,
14: Alack, what mischiefs might he set abrooch
15: In shadow of such greatness! With you, lord bishop,
16: It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken
17: How deep you were within the books of God?
18: To us the speaker in his parliament;
19: To us the imagined voice of God himself;
20: The very opener and intelligencer
21: Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven
22: And our dull workings. O, who shall believe
23: But you misuse the reverence of your place,
24: Employ the countenance and grace of heaven,
25: As a false favourite doth his prince's name,
26: In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,
27: Under the counterfeited zeal of God,
28: The subjects of his substitute, my father,
29: And both against the peace of heaven and him
30: Have here up-swarm'd them.
31: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: Good my Lord of Lancaster,
32: I am not here against your father's peace;
33: But, as I told my lord of Westmoreland,
34: The time misorder'd doth, in common sense,
35: Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,
36: To hold our safety up. I sent your grace
37: The parcels and particulars of our grief,
38: The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,
39: Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;
40: Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep
41: With grant of our most just and right desires,
42: And true obedience, of this madness cured,
43: Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.
44: MOWBRAY: If not, we ready are to try our fortunes
45: To the last man.
46: HASTINGS: And though we here fall down,
47: We have supplies to second our attempt:
48: If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;
49: And so success of mischief shall be born
50: And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
51: Whiles England shall have generation.
52: LANCASTER: You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow,
53: To sound the bottom of the after-times.
54: WESTMORELAND: Pleaseth your grace to answer them directly
55: How far forth you do like their articles.
56: LANCASTER: I like them all, and do allow them well,
57: And swear here, by the honour of my blood,
58: My father's purposes have been mistook,
59: And some about him have too lavishly
60: Wrested his meaning and authority.
61: My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;
62: Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,
63: Discharge your powers unto their several counties,
64: As we will ours: and here between the armies
65: Let's drink together friendly and embrace,
66: That all their eyes may bear those tokens home
67: Of our restored love and amity.
68: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: I take your princely word for these redresses.
69: LANCASTER: I give it you, and will maintain my word:
70: And thereupon I drink unto your grace.
71: HASTINGS: Go, captain, and deliver to the army
72: This news of peace: let them have pay, and part:
73: I know it will well please them. Hie thee, captain.
74: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.
75: WESTMORELAND: I pledge your grace; and, if you knew what pains
76: I have bestow'd to breed this present peace,
77: You would drink freely: but my love to ye
78: Shall show itself more openly hereafter.
79: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: I do not doubt you.
80: WESTMORELAND: I am glad of it.
81: Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.
82: MOWBRAY: You wish me health in very happy season;
83: For I am, on the sudden, something ill.
84: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: Against ill chances men are ever merry;
85: But heaviness foreruns the good event.
86: WESTMORELAND: Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrow
87: Serves to say thus, 'some good thing comes
88: to-morrow.'
89: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.
90: MOWBRAY: So much the worse, if your own rule be true.
91: LANCASTER: The word of peace is render'd: hark, how they shout!
92: MOWBRAY: This had been cheerful after victory.
93: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: A peace is of the nature of a conquest;
94: For then both parties nobly are subdued,
95: And neither party loser.
96: LANCASTER: Go, my lord,
97: And let our army be discharged too.
98: And, good my lord, so please you, let our trains
99: March, by us, that we may peruse the men
100: We should have coped withal.
101: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: Go, good Lord Hastings,
102: And, ere they be dismissed, let them march by.
103: LANCASTER: I trust, lords, we shall lie to-night together.
104: Now, cousin, wherefore stands our army still?
105: WESTMORELAND: The leaders, having charge from you to stand,
106: Will not go off until they hear you speak.
107: LANCASTER: They know their duties.
108: HASTINGS: My lord, our army is dispersed already;
109: Like youthful steers unyoked, they take their courses
110: East, west, north, south; or, like a school broke up,
111: Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.
112: WESTMORELAND: Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which
113: I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason:
114: And you, lord archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,
115: Of capitol treason I attach you both.
116: MOWBRAY: Is this proceeding just and honourable?
117: WESTMORELAND: Is your assembly so?
118: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: Will you thus break your faith?
119: LANCASTER: I pawn'd thee none:
120: I promised you redress of these same grievances
121: Whereof you did complain; which, by mine honour,
122: I will perform with a most Christian care.
123: But for you, rebels, look to taste the due
124: Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours.
125: Most shallowly did you these arms commence,
126: Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence.
127: Strike up our drums, pursue the scatter'd stray:
128: God, and not we, hath safely fought to-day.
129: Some guard these traitors to the block of death,
130: Treason's true bed and yielder up of breath.
ACT 4 SCENE 3

1: FALSTAFF: What's your name, sir? of what condition are you,
2: and of what place, I pray?
3: COLEVILE: I am a knight, sir, and my name is Colevile of the dale.
4: FALSTAFF: Well, then, Colevile is your name, a knight is your
5: degree, and your place the dale: Colevile shall be
6: still your name, a traitor your degree, and the
7: dungeon your place, a place deep enough; so shall
8: you be still Colevile of the dale.
9: COLEVILE: Are not you Sir John Falstaff?
10: FALSTAFF: As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do ye
11: yield, sir? or shall I sweat for you? if I do
12: sweat, they are the drops of thy lovers, and they
13: weep for thy death: therefore rouse up fear and
14: trembling, and do observance to my mercy.
15: COLEVILE: I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that
16: thought yield me.
17: FALSTAFF: I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of
18: mine, and not a tongue of them all speaks any other
19: word but my name. An I had but a belly of any
20: indifference, I were simply the most active fellow
21: in Europe: my womb, my womb, my womb, undoes me.
22: Here comes our general.
23: LANCASTER: The heat is past; follow no further now:
24: Call in the powers, good cousin Westmoreland.
25: Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?
26: When every thing is ended, then you come:
27: These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,
28: One time or other break some gallows' back.
29: FALSTAFF: I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus: I
30: never knew yet but rebuke and cheque was the reward
31: of valour. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a
32: bullet? have I, in my poor and old motion, the
33: expedition of thought? I have speeded hither with
34: the very extremest inch of possibility; I have
35: foundered nine score and odd posts: and here,
36: travel-tainted as I am, have in my pure and
37: immaculate valour, taken Sir John Colevile of the
38: dale, a most furious knight and valorous enemy.
39: But what of that? he saw me, and yielded; that I
40: may justly say, with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome,
41: 'I came, saw, and overcame.'
42: LANCASTER: It was more of his courtesy than your deserving.
43: FALSTAFF: I know not: here he is, and here I yield him: and
44: I beseech your grace, let it be booked with the
45: rest of this day's deeds; or, by the Lord, I will
46: have it in a particular ballad else, with mine own
47: picture on the top on't, Colevile kissing my foot:
48: to the which course if I be enforced, if you do not
49: all show like gilt twopences to me, and I in the
50: clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full
51: moon doth the cinders of the element, which show
52: like pins' heads to her, believe not the word of
53: the noble: therefore let me have right, and let
54: desert mount.
55: LANCASTER: Thine's too heavy to mount.
56: FALSTAFF: Let it shine, then.
57: LANCASTER: Thine's too thick to shine.
58: FALSTAFF: Let it do something, my good lord, that may do me
59: good, and call it what you will.
60: LANCASTER: Is thy name Colevile?
61: COLEVILE: It is, my lord.
62: LANCASTER: A famous rebel art thou, Colevile.
63: FALSTAFF: And a famous true subject took him.
64: COLEVILE: I am, my lord, but as my betters are
65: That led me hither: had they been ruled by me,
66: You should have won them dearer than you have.
67: FALSTAFF: I know not how they sold themselves: but thou, like
68: a kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis; and I
69: thank thee for thee.
70: LANCASTER: Now, have you left pursuit?
71: WESTMORELAND: Retreat is made and execution stay'd.
72: LANCASTER: Send Colevile with his confederates
73: To York, to present execution:
74: Blunt, lead him hence; and see you guard him sure.
75: And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords:
76: I hear the king my father is sore sick:
77: Our news shall go before us to his majesty,
78: Which, cousin, you shall bear to comfort him,
79: And we with sober speed will follow you.
80: FALSTAFF: My lord, I beseech you, give me leave to go
81: Through Gloucestershire: and, when you come to court,
82: Stand my good lord, pray, in your good report.
83: LANCASTER: Fare you well, Falstaff: I, in my condition,
84: Shall better speak of you than you deserve.
85: FALSTAFF: I would you had but the wit: 'twere better than
86: your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-
87: blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make
88: him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine.
89: There's never none of these demure boys come to any
90: proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,
91: and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a
92: kind of male green-sickness; and then when they
93: marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools
94: and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for
95: inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold
96: operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;
97: dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy
98: vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,
99: quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and
100: delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the
101: voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes
102: excellent wit. The second property of your
103: excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;
104: which, before cold and settled, left the liver
105: white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity
106: and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes
107: it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:
108: it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives
109: warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,
110: man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and
111: inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,
112: the heart, who, great and puffed up with this
113: retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour
114: comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is
115: nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and
116: learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till
117: sack commences it and sets it in act and use.
118: Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for
119: the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his
120: father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,
121: manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent
122: endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile
123: sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If
124: I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I
125: would teach them should be, to forswear thin
126: potations and to addict themselves to sack.
127: How now Bardolph?
128: BARDOLPH: The army is discharged all and gone.
129: FALSTAFF: Let them go. I'll through Gloucestershire; and
130: there will I visit Master Robert Shallow, esquire:
131: I have him already tempering between my finger and
132: my thumb, and shortly will I seal with him. Come away.
ACT 4 SCENE 4

1: KING HENRY IV: Now, lords, if God doth give successful end
2: To this debate that bleedeth at our doors,
3: We will our youth lead on to higher fields
4: And draw no swords but what are sanctified.
5: Our navy is address'd, our power collected,
6: Our substitutes in absence well invested,
7: And every thing lies level to our wish:
8: Only, we want a little personal strength;
9: And pause us, till these rebels, now afoot,
10: Come underneath the yoke of government.
11: WARWICK: Both which we doubt not but your majesty
12: Shall soon enjoy.
13: KING HENRY IV: Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,
14: Where is the prince your brother?
15: GLOUCESTER: I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.
16: KING HENRY IV: And how accompanied?
17: GLOUCESTER: I do not know, my lord.
18: KING HENRY IV: Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?
19: GLOUCESTER: No, my good lord; he is in presence here.
20: CLARENCE: What would my lord and father?
21: KING HENRY IV: Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.
22: How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?
23: He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas;
24: Thou hast a better place in his affection
25: Than all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,
26: And noble offices thou mayst effect
27: Of mediation, after I am dead,
28: Between his greatness and thy other brethren:
29: Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,
30: Nor lose the good advantage of his grace
31: By seeming cold or careless of his will;
32: For he is gracious, if he be observed:
33: He hath a tear for pity and a hand
34: Open as day for melting charity:
35: Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he's flint,
36: As humorous as winter and as sudden
37: As flaws congealed in the spring of day.
38: His temper, therefore, must be well observed:
39: Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,
40: When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth;
41: But, being moody, give him line and scope,
42: Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,
43: Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,
44: And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,
45: A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,
46: That the united vessel of their blood,
47: Mingled with venom of suggestion--
48: As, force perforce, the age will pour it in--
49: Shall never leak, though it do work as strong
50: As aconitum or rash gunpowder.
51: CLARENCE: I shall observe him with all care and love.
52: KING HENRY IV: Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?
53: CLARENCE: He is not there to-day; he dines in London.
54: KING HENRY IV: And how accompanied? canst thou tell that?
55: CLARENCE: With Poins, and other his continual followers.
56: KING HENRY IV: Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;
57: And he, the noble image of my youth,
58: Is overspread with them: therefore my grief
59: Stretches itself beyond the hour of death:
60: The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape
61: In forms imaginary the unguided days
62: And rotten times that you shall look upon
63: When I am sleeping with my ancestors.
64: For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,
65: When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,
66: When means and lavish manners meet together,
67: O, with what wings shall his affections fly
68: Towards fronting peril and opposed decay!
69: WARWICK: My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite:
70: The prince but studies his companions
71: Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,
72: 'Tis needful that the most immodest word
73: Be look'd upon and learn'd; which once attain'd,
74: Your highness knows, comes to no further use
75: But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,
76: The prince will in the perfectness of time
77: Cast off his followers; and their memory
78: Shall as a pattern or a measure live,
79: By which his grace must mete the lives of others,
80: Turning past evils to advantages.
81: KING HENRY IV: 'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb
82: In the dead carrion.
83: Who's here? Westmoreland?
84: WESTMORELAND: Health to my sovereign, and new happiness
85: Added to that that I am to deliver!
86: Prince John your son doth kiss your grace's hand:
87: Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop, Hastings and all
88: Are brought to the correction of your law;
89: There is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'd
90: But peace puts forth her olive every where.
91: The manner how this action hath been borne
92: Here at more leisure may your highness read,
93: With every course in his particular.
94: KING HENRY IV: O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,
95: Which ever in the haunch of winter sings
96: The lifting up of day.
97: Look, here's more news.
98: HARCOURT: From enemies heaven keep your majesty;
99: And, when they stand against you, may they fall
100: As those that I am come to tell you of!
101: The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph,
102: With a great power of English and of Scots
103: Are by the sheriff of Yorkshire overthrown:
104: The manner and true order of the fight
105: This packet, please it you, contains at large.
106: KING HENRY IV: And wherefore should these good news make me sick?
107: Will fortune never come with both hands full,
108: But write her fair words still in foulest letters?
109: She either gives a stomach and no food;
110: Such are the poor, in health; or else a feast
111: And takes away the stomach; such are the rich,
112: That have abundance and enjoy it not.
113: I should rejoice now at this happy news;
114: And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy:
115: O me! come near me; now I am much ill.
116: GLOUCESTER: Comfort, your majesty!
117: CLARENCE: O my royal father!
118: WESTMORELAND: My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look up.
119: WARWICK: Be patient, princes; you do know, these fits
120: Are with his highness very ordinary.
121: Stand from him. Give him air; he'll straight be well.
122: CLARENCE: No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs:
123: The incessant care and labour of his mind
124: Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in
125: So thin that life looks through and will break out.
126: GLOUCESTER: The people fear me; for they do observe
127: Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature:
128: The seasons change their manners, as the year
129: Had found some months asleep and leap'd them over.
130: CLARENCE: The river hath thrice flow'd, no ebb between;
131: And the old folk, time's doting chronicles,
132: Say it did so a little time before
133: That our great-grandsire, Edward, sick'd and died.
134: WARWICK: Speak lower, princes, for the king recovers.
135: GLOUCESTER: This apoplexy will certain be his end.
136: KING HENRY IV: I pray you, take me up, and bear me hence
137: Into some other chamber: softly, pray.
ACT 4 SCENE 5

1: KING HENRY IV: Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends;
2: Unless some dull and favourable hand
3: Will whisper music to my weary spirit.
4: WARWICK: Call for the music in the other room.
5: KING HENRY IV: Set me the crown upon my pillow here.
6: CLARENCE: His eye is hollow, and he changes much.
7: WARWICK: Less noise, less noise!
8: PRINCE HENRY: Who saw the Duke of Clarence?
9: CLARENCE: I am here, brother, full of heaviness.
10: PRINCE HENRY: How now! rain within doors, and none abroad!
11: How doth the king?
12: GLOUCESTER: Exceeding ill.
13: PRINCE HENRY: Heard he the good news yet?
14: Tell it him.
15: GLOUCESTER: He alter'd much upon the hearing it.
16: PRINCE HENRY: If he be sick with joy, he'll recover without physic.
17: WARWICK: Not so much noise, my lords: sweet prince,
18: speak low;
19: The king your father is disposed to sleep.
20: CLARENCE: Let us withdraw into the other room.
21: WARWICK: Will't please your grace to go along with us?
22: PRINCE HENRY: No; I will sit and watch here by the king.
23: Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,
24: Being so troublesome a bedfellow?
25: O polish'd perturbation! golden care!
26: That keep'st the ports of slumber open wide
27: To many a watchful night! sleep with it now!
28: Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet
29: As he whose brow with homely biggen bound
30: Snores out the watch of night. O majesty!
31: When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit
32: Like a rich armour worn in heat of day,
33: That scalds with safety. By his gates of breath
34: There lies a downy feather which stirs not:
35: Did he suspire, that light and weightless down
36: Perforce must move. My gracious lord! my father!
37: This sleep is sound indeed, this is a sleep
38: That from this golden rigol hath divorced
39: So many English kings. Thy due from me
40: Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,
41: Which nature, love, and filial tenderness,
42: Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously:
43: My due from thee is this imperial crown,
44: Which, as immediate as thy place and blood,
45: Derives itself to me. Lo, here it sits,
46: Which God shall guard: and put the world's whole strength
47: Into one giant arm, it shall not force
48: This lineal honour from me: this from thee
49: Will I to mine leave, as 'tis left to me.
50: KING HENRY IV: Warwick! Gloucester! Clarence!
51: CLARENCE: Doth the king call?
52: WARWICK: What would your majesty? How fares your grace?
53: KING HENRY IV: Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?
54: CLARENCE: We left the prince my brother here, my liege,
55: Who undertook to sit and watch by you.
56: KING HENRY IV: The Prince of Wales! Where is he? let me see him:
57: He is not here.
58: WARWICK: This door is open; he is gone this way.
59: GLOUCESTER: He came not through the chamber where we stay'd.
60: KING HENRY IV: Where is the crown? who took it from my pillow?
61: WARWICK: When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.
62: KING HENRY IV: The prince hath ta'en it hence: go, seek him out.
63: Is he so hasty that he doth suppose
64: My sleep my death?
65: Find him, my Lord of Warwick; chide him hither.
66: This part of his conjoins with my disease,
67: And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are!
68: How quickly nature falls into revolt
69: When gold becomes her object!
70: For this the foolish over-careful fathers
71: Have broke their sleep with thoughts, their brains with care,
72: Their bones with industry;
73: For this they have engrossed and piled up
74: The canker'd heaps of strange-achieved gold;
75: For this they have been thoughtful to invest
76: Their sons with arts and martial exercises:
77: When, like the bee, culling from every flower
78: The virtuous sweets,
79: Our thighs pack'd with wax, our mouths with honey,
80: We bring it to the hive, and, like the bees,
81: Are murdered for our pains. This bitter taste
82: Yield his engrossments to the ending father.
83: Now, where is he that will not stay so long
84: Till his friend sickness hath determined me?
85: WARWICK: My lord, I found the prince in the next room,
86: Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks,
87: With such a deep demeanor in great sorrow
88: That tyranny, which never quaff'd but blood,
89: Would, by beholding him, have wash'd his knife
90: With gentle eye-drops. He is coming hither.
91: KING HENRY IV: But wherefore did he take away the crown?
92: Lo, where he comes. Come hither to me, Harry.
93: Depart the chamber, leave us here alone.
94: PRINCE HENRY: I never thought to hear you speak again.
95: KING HENRY IV: Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought:
96: I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.
97: Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair
98: That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours
99: Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!
100: Thou seek'st the greatness that will o'erwhelm thee.
101: Stay but a little; for my cloud of dignity
102: Is held from falling with so weak a wind
103: That it will quickly drop: my day is dim.
104: Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours
105: Were thine without offence; and at my death
106: Thou hast seal'd up my expectation:
107: Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not,
108: And thou wilt have me die assured of it.
109: Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,
110: Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,
111: To stab at half an hour of my life.
112: What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?
113: Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,
114: And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
115: That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.
116: Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
117: Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head:
118: Only compound me with forgotten dust
119: Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
120: Pluck down my officers, break my decrees;
121: For now a time is come to mock at form:
122: Harry the Fifth is crown'd: up, vanity!
123: Down, royal state! all you sage counsellors, hence!
124: And to the English court assemble now,
125: From every region, apes of idleness!
126: Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum:
127: Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance,
128: Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit
129: The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?
130: Be happy, he will trouble you no more;
131: England shall double gild his treble guilt,
132: England shall give him office, honour, might;
133: For the fifth Harry from curb'd licence plucks
134: The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog
135: Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.
136: O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!
137: When that my care could not withhold thy riots,
138: What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?
139: O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,
140: Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!
141: PRINCE HENRY: O, pardon me, my liege! but for my tears,
142: The moist impediments unto my speech,
143: I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke
144: Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
145: The course of it so far. There is your crown;
146: And He that wears the crown immortally
147: Long guard it yours! If I affect it more
148: Than as your honour and as your renown,
149: Let me no more from this obedience rise,
150: Which my most inward true and duteous spirit
151: Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.
152: God witness with me, when I here came in,
153: And found no course of breath within your majesty,
154: How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,
155: O, let me in my present wildness die
156: And never live to show the incredulous world
157: The noble change that I have purposed!
158: Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,
159: And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,
160: I spake unto this crown as having sense,
161: And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending
162: Hath fed upon the body of my father;
163: Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:
164: Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,
165: Preserving life in medicine potable;
166: But thou, most fine, most honour'd: most renown'd,
167: Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,
168: Accusing it, I put it on my head,
169: To try with it, as with an enemy
170: That had before my face murder'd my father,
171: The quarrel of a true inheritor.
172: But if it did infect my blood with joy,
173: Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;
174: If any rebel or vain spirit of mine
175: Did with the least affection of a welcome
176: Give entertainment to the might of it,
177: Let God for ever keep it from my head
178: And make me as the poorest vassal is
179: That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!
180: KING HENRY IV: O my son,
181: God put it in thy mind to take it hence,
182: That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,
183: Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!
184: Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;
185: And hear, I think, the very latest counsel
186: That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,
187: By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways
188: I met this crown; and I myself know well
189: How troublesome it sat upon my head.
190: To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,
191: Better opinion, better confirmation;
192: For all the soil of the achievement goes
193: With me into the earth. It seem'd in me
194: But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,
195: And I had many living to upbraid
196: My gain of it by their assistances;
197: Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,
198: Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears
199: Thou see'st with peril I have answered;
200: For all my reign hath been but as a scene
201: Acting that argument: and now my death
202: Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,
203: Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;
204: So thou the garland wear'st successively.
205: Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,
206: Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;
207: And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,
208: Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;
209: By whose fell working I was first advanced
210: And by whose power I well might lodge a fear
211: To be again displaced: which to avoid,
212: I cut them off; and had a purpose now
213: To lead out many to the Holy Land,
214: Lest rest and lying still might make them look
215: Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,
216: Be it thy course to busy giddy minds
217: With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,
218: May waste the memory of the former days.
219: More would I, but my lungs are wasted so
220: That strength of speech is utterly denied me.
221: How I came by the crown, O God forgive;
222: And grant it may with thee in true peace live!
223: PRINCE HENRY: My gracious liege,
224: You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me;
225: Then plain and right must my possession be:
226: Which I with more than with a common pain
227: 'Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain.
228: KING HENRY IV: Look, look, here comes my John of Lancaster.
229: LANCASTER: Health, peace, and happiness to my royal father!
230: KING HENRY IV: Thou bring'st me happiness and peace, son John;
231: But health, alack, with youthful wings is flown
232: From this bare wither'd trunk: upon thy sight
233: My worldly business makes a period.
234: Where is my Lord of Warwick?
235: PRINCE HENRY: My Lord of Warwick!
236: KING HENRY IV: Doth any name particular belong
237: Unto the lodging where I first did swoon?
238: WARWICK: 'Tis call'd Jerusalem, my noble lord.
ACT 5 SCENE 1

1: SHALLOW: By cock and pie, sir, you shall not away to-night.
2: What, Davy, I say!
3: FALSTAFF: You must excuse me, Master Robert Shallow.
4: SHALLOW: I will not excuse you; you shall not be excused;
5: excuses shall not be admitted; there is no excuse
6: shall serve; you shall not be excused. Why, Davy!
7: DAVY: Here, sir.
8: SHALLOW: Davy, Davy, Davy, Davy, let me see, Davy; let me
9: see, Davy; let me see: yea, marry, William cook,
10: bid him come hither. Sir John, you shall not be excused.
11: DAVY: Marry, sir, thus; those precepts cannot be served:
12: and, again, sir, shall we sow the headland with wheat?
13: SHALLOW: With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook: are
14: there no young pigeons?
15: DAVY: Yes, sir. Here is now the smith's note for shoeing
16: and plough-irons.
17: SHALLOW: Let it be cast and paid. Sir John, you shall not be excused.
18: DAVY: Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must need be
19: had: and, sir, do you mean to stop any of William's
20: wages, about the sack he lost the other day at
21: Hinckley fair?
22: SHALLOW: A' shall answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a couple
23: of short-legged hens, a joint of mutton, and any
24: pretty little tiny kickshaws, tell William cook.
25: DAVY: Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?
26: SHALLOW: Yea, Davy. I will use him well: a friend i' the
27: court is better than a penny in purse. Use his men
28: well, Davy; for they are arrant knaves, and will backbite.
29: DAVY: No worse than they are backbitten, sir; for they
30: have marvellous foul linen.
31: SHALLOW: Well conceited, Davy: about thy business, Davy.
32: DAVY: I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor of
33: Woncot against Clement Perkes of the hill.
34: SHALLOW: There is many complaints, Davy, against that Visor:
35: that Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge.
36: DAVY: I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but
37: yet, God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some
38: countenance at his friend's request. An honest
39: man, sir, is able to speak for himself, when a knave
40: is not. I have served your worship truly, sir,
41: this eight years; and if I cannot once or twice in
42: a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I
43: have but a very little credit with your worship. The
44: knave is mine honest friend, sir; therefore, I
45: beseech your worship, let him be countenanced.
46: SHALLOW: Go to; I say he shall have no wrong. Look about, Davy.
47: Where are you, Sir John? Come, come, come, off
48: with your boots. Give me your hand, Master Bardolph.
49: BARDOLPH: I am glad to see your worship.
50: SHALLOW: I thank thee with all my heart, kind
51: Master Bardolph: and welcome, my tall fellow.
52: Come, Sir John.
53: FALSTAFF: I'll follow you, good Master Robert Shallow.
54: Bardolph, look to our horses.
55: If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four
56: dozen of such bearded hermits' staves as Master
57: Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to see the
58: semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his:
59: they, by observing of him, do bear themselves like
60: foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is
61: turned into a justice-like serving-man: their
62: spirits are so married in conjunction with the
63: participation of society that they flock together in
64: consent, like so many wild-geese. If I had a suit
65: to Master Shallow, I would humour his men with the
66: imputation of being near their master: if to his
67: men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man
68: could better command his servants. It is certain
69: that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is
70: caught, as men take diseases, one of another:
71: therefore let men take heed of their company. I
72: will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to
73: keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing
74: out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two
75: actions, and a' shall laugh without intervallums. O,
76: it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest
77: with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never
78: had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see him
79: laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up!
80: SHALLOW: [Within] Sir John!
81: FALSTAFF: I come, Master Shallow; I come, Master Shallow.
ACT 5 SCENE 2

1: WARWICK: How now, my lord chief-justice! whither away?
2: Lord Chief-Justice How doth the king?
3: Exceeding well; his cares are now all ended.
4: Lord Chief-Justice I hope, not dead.
5: He's walk'd the way of nature;
6: And to our purposes he lives no more.
7: Lord Chief-Justice I would his majesty had call'd me with him:
8: The service that I truly did his life
9: Hath left me open to all injuries.
10: Indeed I think the young king loves you not.
11: Lord Chief-Justice I know he doth not, and do arm myself
12: To welcome the condition of the time,
13: Which cannot look more hideously upon me
14: Than I have drawn it in my fantasy.
15: Here come the heavy issue of dead Harry:
16: O that the living Harry had the temper
17: Of him, the worst of these three gentlemen!
18: How many nobles then should hold their places
19: That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!
20: Lord Chief-Justice O God, I fear all will be overturn'd!
21: LANCASTER: Good morrow, cousin Warwick, good morrow.
22: CLARENCE: Good morrow, cousin.
23: LANCASTER: We meet like men that had forgot to speak.
24: WARWICK: We do remember; but our argument
25: Is all too heavy to admit much talk.
26: LANCASTER: Well, peace be with him that hath made us heavy.
27: Lord Chief-Justice Peace be with us, lest we be heavier!
28: GLOUCESTER: O, good my lord, you have lost a friend indeed;
29: And I dare swear you borrow not that face
30: Of seeming sorrow, it is sure your own.
31: LANCASTER: Though no man be assured what grace to find,
32: You stand in coldest expectation:
33: I am the sorrier; would 'twere otherwise.
34: CLARENCE: Well, you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair;
35: Which swims against your stream of quality.
36: Lord Chief-Justice Sweet princes, what I did, I did in honour,
37: Led by the impartial conduct of my soul:
38: And never shall you see that I will beg
39: A ragged and forestall'd remission.
40: If truth and upright innocency fail me,
41: I'll to the king my master that is dead,
42: And tell him who hath sent me after him.
43: WARWICK: Here comes the prince.
44: Lord Chief-Justice Good morrow; and God save your majesty!
45: KING HENRY V: This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,
46: Sits not so easy on me as you think.
47: Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear:
48: This is the English, not the Turkish court;
49: Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
50: But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,
51: For, by my faith, it very well becomes you:
52: Sorrow so royally in you appears
53: That I will deeply put the fashion on
54: And wear it in my heart: why then, be sad;
55: But entertain no more of it, good brothers,
56: Than a joint burden laid upon us all.
57: For me, by heaven, I bid you be assured,
58: I'll be your father and your brother too;
59: Let me but bear your love, I 'll bear your cares:
60: Yet weep that Harry's dead; and so will I;
61: But Harry lives, that shall convert those tears
62: By number into hours of happiness.
63: Princes: We hope no other from your majesty.
64: KING HENRY V: You all look strangely on me: and you most;
65: You are, I think, assured I love you not.
66: Lord Chief-Justice I am assured, if I be measured rightly,
67: Your majesty hath no just cause to hate me.
68: No!
69: How might a prince of my great hopes forget
70: So great indignities you laid upon me?
71: What! rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison
72: The immediate heir of England! Was this easy?
73: May this be wash'd in Lethe, and forgotten?
74: Lord Chief-Justice I then did use the person of your father;
75: The image of his power lay then in me:
76: And, in the administration of his law,
77: Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,
78: Your highness pleased to forget my place,
79: The majesty and power of law and justice,
80: The image of the king whom I presented,
81: And struck me in my very seat of judgment;
82: Whereon, as an offender to your father,
83: I gave bold way to my authority
84: And did commit you. If the deed were ill,
85: Be you contented, wearing now the garland,
86: To have a son set your decrees at nought,
87: To pluck down justice from your awful bench,
88: To trip the course of law and blunt the sword
89: That guards the peace and safety of your person;
90: Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal image
91: And mock your workings in a second body.
92: Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;
93: Be now the father and propose a son,
94: Hear your own dignity so much profaned,
95: See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,
96: Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd;
97: And then imagine me taking your part
98: And in your power soft silencing your son:
99: After this cold considerance, sentence me;
100: And, as you are a king, speak in your state
101: What I have done that misbecame my place,
102: My person, or my liege's sovereignty.
103: You are right, justice, and you weigh this well;
104: Therefore still bear the balance and the sword:
105: And I do wish your honours may increase,
106: Till you do live to see a son of mine
107: Offend you and obey you, as I did.
108: So shall I live to speak my father's words:
109: 'Happy am I, that have a man so bold,
110: That dares do justice on my proper son;
111: And not less happy, having such a son,
112: That would deliver up his greatness so
113: Into the hands of justice.' You did commit me:
114: For which, I do commit into your hand
115: The unstained sword that you have used to bear;
116: With this remembrance, that you use the same
117: With the like bold, just and impartial spirit
118: As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand.
119: You shall be as a father to my youth:
120: My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,
121: And I will stoop and humble my intents
122: To your well-practised wise directions.
123: And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;
124: My father is gone wild into his grave,
125: For in his tomb lie my affections;
126: And with his spirit sadly I survive,
127: To mock the expectation of the world,
128: To frustrate prophecies and to raze out
129: Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down
130: After my seeming. The tide of blood in me
131: Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now:
132: Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,
133: Where it shall mingle with the state of floods
134: And flow henceforth in formal majesty.
135: Now call we our high court of parliament:
136: And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,
137: That the great body of our state may go
138: In equal rank with the best govern'd nation;
139: That war, or peace, or both at once, may be
140: As things acquainted and familiar to us;
141: In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.
142: Our coronation done, we will accite,
143: As I before remember'd, all our state:
144: And, God consigning to my good intents,
145: No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,
146: God shorten Harry's happy life one day!
ACT 5 SCENE 3

1: SHALLOW: Nay, you shall see my orchard, where, in an arbour,
2: we will eat a last year's pippin of my own graffing,
3: with a dish of caraways, and so forth: come,
4: cousin Silence: and then to bed.

11: SHALLOW: A good varlet, a good varlet, a very good varlet,
12: Sir John: by the mass, I have drunk too much sack
13: at supper: a good varlet. Now sit down, now sit
14: down: come, cousin.
15: SILENCE: Ah, sirrah! quoth-a, we shall
16: Do nothing but eat, and make good cheer,
17: And praise God for the merry year;
18: When flesh is cheap and females dear,
19: And lusty lads roam here and there
20: So merrily,
21: And ever among so merrily.
22: FALSTAFF: There's a merry heart! Good Master Silence, I'll
23: give you a health for that anon.
24: SHALLOW: Give Master Bardolph some wine, Davy.
25: DAVY: Sweet sir, sit; I'll be with you anon. most sweet
26: sir, sit. Master page, good master page, sit.
27: Proface! What you want in meat, we'll have in drink:
28: but you must bear; the heart's all.
29: SHALLOW: Be merry, Master Bardolph; and, my little soldier
30: there, be merry.
31: SILENCE: Be merry, be merry, my wife has all;
32: For women are shrews, both short and tall:
33: 'Tis merry in hall when beards wag all,
34: And welcome merry Shrove-tide.
35: Be merry, be merry.
36: FALSTAFF: I did not think Master Silence had been a man of
37: this mettle.
38: SILENCE: Who, I? I have been merry twice and once ere now.
39: DAVY: There's a dish of leather-coats for you.
40: SHALLOW: Davy!
41: DAVY: Your worship! I'll be with you straight.
42: A cup of wine, sir?
43: SILENCE: A cup of wine that's brisk and fine,
44: And drink unto the leman mine;
45: And a merry heart lives long-a.
46: FALSTAFF: Well said, Master Silence.
47: SILENCE: An we shall be merry, now comes in the sweet o' the night.
48: FALSTAFF: Health and long life to you, Master Silence.
49: SILENCE: Fill the cup, and let it come;
50: I'll pledge you a mile to the bottom.
51: SHALLOW: Honest Bardolph, welcome: if thou wantest any
52: thing, and wilt not call, beshrew thy heart.
53: Welcome, my little tiny thief.
54: And welcome indeed too. I'll drink to Master
55: Bardolph, and to all the cavaleros about London.
56: DAVY: I hove to see London once ere I die.
57: BARDOLPH: An I might see you there, Davy,--
58: SHALLOW: By the mass, you'll crack a quart together, ha!
59: Will you not, Master Bardolph?
60: BARDOLPH: Yea, sir, in a pottle-pot.
61: SHALLOW: By God's liggens, I thank thee: the knave will
62: stick by thee, I can assure thee that. A' will not
63: out; he is true bred.
64: BARDOLPH: And I'll stick by him, sir.
65: SHALLOW: Why, there spoke a king. Lack nothing: be merry.
66: Look who's at door there, ho! who knocks?
67: FALSTAFF: Why, now you have done me right.
68: SILENCE: [Singing]
69: Do me right,
70: And dub me knight: Samingo.
71: Is't not so?
72: FALSTAFF: 'Tis so.
73: SILENCE: Is't so? Why then, say an old man can do somewhat.
74: DAVY: An't please your worship, there's one Pistol come
75: from the court with news.
76: FALSTAFF: From the court! let him come in.
77: How now, Pistol!
78: PISTOL: Sir John, God save you!
79: FALSTAFF: What wind blew you hither, Pistol?
80: PISTOL: Not the ill wind which blows no man to good. Sweet
81: knight, thou art now one of the greatest men in this realm.
82: SILENCE: By'r lady, I think a' be, but goodman Puff of Barson.
83: PISTOL: Puff!
84: Puff in thy teeth, most recreant coward base!
85: Sir John, I am thy Pistol and thy friend,
86: And helter-skelter have I rode to thee,
87: And tidings do I bring and lucky joys
88: And golden times and happy news of price.
89: FALSTAFF: I pray thee now, deliver them like a man of this world.
90: PISTOL: A foutre for the world and worldlings base!
91: I speak of Africa and golden joys.
92: FALSTAFF: O base Assyrian knight, what is thy news?
93: Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof.
94: SILENCE: And Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John.
95: PISTOL: Shall dunghill curs confront the Helicons?
96: And shall good news be baffled?
97: Then, Pistol, lay thy head in Furies' lap.
98: SILENCE: Honest gentleman, I know not your breeding.
99: PISTOL: Why then, lament therefore.
100: SHALLOW: Give me pardon, sir: if, sir, you come with news
101: from the court, I take it there's but two ways,
102: either to utter them, or to conceal them. I am,
103: sir, under the king, in some authority.
104: PISTOL: Under which king, Besonian? speak, or die.
105: SHALLOW: Under King Harry.
106: PISTOL: Harry the Fourth? or Fifth?
107: SHALLOW: Harry the Fourth.
108: PISTOL: A foutre for thine office!
109: Sir John, thy tender lambkin now is king;
110: Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth:
111: When Pistol lies, do this; and fig me, like
112: The bragging Spaniard.
113: FALSTAFF: What, is the old king dead?
114: PISTOL: As nail in door: the things I speak are just.
115: FALSTAFF: Away, Bardolph! saddle my horse. Master Robert
116: Shallow, choose what office thou wilt in the land,
117: 'tis thine. Pistol, I will double-charge thee with dignities.
118: BARDOLPH: O joyful day!
119: I would not take a knighthood for my fortune.
120: PISTOL: What! I do bring good news.
121: FALSTAFF: Carry Master Silence to bed. Master Shallow, my
122: Lord Shallow,--be what thou wilt; I am fortune's
123: steward--get on thy boots: we'll ride all night.
124: O sweet Pistol! Away, Bardolph!
125: Come, Pistol, utter more to me; and withal devise
126: something to do thyself good. Boot, boot, Master
127: Shallow: I know the young king is sick for me. Let
128: us take any man's horses; the laws of England are at
129: my commandment. Blessed are they that have been my
130: friends; and woe to my lord chief-justice!
131: PISTOL: Let vultures vile seize on his lungs also!
132: 'Where is the life that late I led?' say they:
133: Why, here it is; welcome these pleasant days!
ACT 5 SCENE 4

1: MISTRESS QUICKLY: No, thou arrant knave; I would to God that I might
2: die, that I might have thee hanged: thou hast
3: drawn my shoulder out of joint.
4: First Beadle: The constables have delivered her over to me; and
5: she shall have whipping-cheer enough, I warrant
6: her: there hath been a man or two lately killed about her.
7: DOLL TEARSHEET: Nut-hook, nut-hook, you lie. Come on; I 'll tell
8: thee what, thou damned tripe-visaged rascal, an
9: the child I now go with do miscarry, thou wert
10: better thou hadst struck thy mother, thou
11: paper-faced villain.
12: MISTRESS QUICKLY: O the Lord, that Sir John were come! he would make
13: this a bloody day to somebody. But I pray God the
14: fruit of her womb miscarry!
15: First Beadle: If it do, you shall have a dozen of cushions again;
16: you have but eleven now. Come, I charge you both go
17: with me; for the man is dead that you and Pistol
18: beat amongst you.
19: DOLL TEARSHEET: I'll tell you what, you thin man in a censer, I
20: will have you as soundly swinged for this,--you
21: blue-bottle rogue, you filthy famished correctioner,
22: if you be not swinged, I'll forswear half-kirtles.
23: First Beadle: Come, come, you she knight-errant, come.
24: MISTRESS QUICKLY: O God, that right should thus overcome might!
25: Well, of sufferance comes ease.
26: DOLL TEARSHEET: Come, you rogue, come; bring me to a justice.
27: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Ay, come, you starved blood-hound.
28: DOLL TEARSHEET: Goodman death, goodman bones!
29: MISTRESS QUICKLY: Thou atomy, thou!
30: DOLL TEARSHEET: Come, you thin thing; come you rascal.
31: First Beadle: Very well.
ACT 5 SCENE 5

1: First Groom: More rushes, more rushes.
2: Second Groom: The trumpets have sounded twice.
3: First Groom: 'Twill be two o'clock ere they come from the
4: coronation: dispatch, dispatch.
5: FALSTAFF: Stand here by me, Master Robert Shallow; I will
6: make the king do you grace: I will leer upon him as
7: a' comes by; and do but mark the countenance that he
8: will give me.
9: PISTOL: God bless thy lungs, good knight.
10: FALSTAFF: Come here, Pistol; stand behind me. O, if I had had
11: time to have made new liveries, I would have
12: bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you. But
13: 'tis no matter; this poor show doth better: this
14: doth infer the zeal I had to see him.
15: SHALLOW: It doth so.
16: FALSTAFF: It shows my earnestness of affection,--
17: SHALLOW: It doth so.
18: FALSTAFF: My devotion,--
19: SHALLOW: It doth, it doth, it doth.
20: FALSTAFF: As it were, to ride day and night; and not to
21: deliberate, not to remember, not to have patience
22: to shift me,--
23: SHALLOW: It is best, certain.
24: FALSTAFF: But to stand stained with travel, and sweating with
25: desire to see him; thinking of nothing else,
26: putting all affairs else in oblivion, as if there
27: were nothing else to be done but to see him.
28: PISTOL: 'Tis 'semper idem,' for 'obsque hoc nihil est:'
29: 'tis all in every part.
30: SHALLOW: 'Tis so, indeed.
31: PISTOL: My knight, I will inflame thy noble liver,
32: And make thee rage.
33: Thy Doll, and Helen of thy noble thoughts,
34: Is in base durance and contagious prison;
35: Haled thither
36: By most mechanical and dirty hand:
37: Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell
38: Alecto's snake,
39: For Doll is in. Pistol speaks nought but truth.
40: FALSTAFF: I will deliver her.
41: PISTOL: There roar'd the sea, and trumpet-clangor sounds.
42: FALSTAFF: God save thy grace, King Hal! my royal Hal!
43: PISTOL: The heavens thee guard and keep, most royal imp of fame!
44: FALSTAFF: God save thee, my sweet boy!
45: KING HENRY IV: My lord chief-justice, speak to that vain man.
46: Lord Chief-Justice Have you your wits? know you what 'tis to speak?
47: FALSTAFF: My king! my Jove! I speak to thee, my heart!
48: KING HENRY IV: I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers;
49: How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!
50: I have long dream'd of such a kind of man,
51: So surfeit-swell'd, so old and so profane;
52: But, being awaked, I do despise my dream.
53: Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace;
54: Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape
55: For thee thrice wider than for other men.
56: Reply not to me with a fool-born jest:
57: Presume not that I am the thing I was;
58: For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,
59: That I have turn'd away my former self;
60: So will I those that kept me company.
61: When thou dost hear I am as I have been,
62: Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,
63: The tutor and the feeder of my riots:
64: Till then, I banish thee, on pain of death,
65: As I have done the rest of my misleaders,
66: Not to come near our person by ten mile.
67: For competence of life I will allow you,
68: That lack of means enforce you not to evil:
69: And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,
70: We will, according to your strengths and qualities,
71: Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord,
72: To see perform'd the tenor of our word. Set on.
73: FALSTAFF: Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pound.
74: SHALLOW: Yea, marry, Sir John; which I beseech you to let me
75: have home with me.
76: FALSTAFF: That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not you
77: grieve at this; I shall be sent for in private to
78: him: look you, he must seem thus to the world:
79: fear not your advancements; I will be the man yet
80: that shall make you great.
81: SHALLOW: I cannot well perceive how, unless you should give
82: me your doublet and stuff me out with straw. I
83: beseech you, good Sir John, let me have five hundred
84: of my thousand.
85: FALSTAFF: Sir, I will be as good as my word: this that you
86: heard was but a colour.
87: SHALLOW: A colour that I fear you will die in, Sir John.
88: FALSTAFF: Fear no colours: go with me to dinner: come,
89: Lieutenant Pistol; come, Bardolph: I shall be sent
90: for soon at night.
91: Lord Chief-Justice Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet:
92: Take all his company along with him.
93: My lord, my lord,--
94: Lord Chief-Justice I cannot now speak: I will hear you soon.
95: Take them away.
96: PISTOL: Si fortune me tormenta, spero contenta.
97: LANCASTER: I like this fair proceeding of the king's:
98: He hath intent his wonted followers
99: Shall all be very well provided for;
100: But all are banish'd till their conversations
101: Appear more wise and modest to the world.
102: Lord Chief-Justice And so they are.
103: The king hath call'd his parliament, my lord.
104: Lord Chief-Justice He hath.
