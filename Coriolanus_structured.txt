ACT 1 SCENE 1

1: First Citizen: Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
2: All: Speak, speak.
3: First Citizen: You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
4: All: Resolved. resolved.
5: First Citizen: First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.
6: All: We know't, we know't.
7: First Citizen: Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
8: Is't a verdict?
9: All: No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!
10: Second Citizen: One word, good citizens.
11: First Citizen: We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
12: What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
13: would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
14: wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;
15: but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
16: afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
17: inventory to particularise their abundance; our
18: sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
19: our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
20: speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.
21: Second Citizen: Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?
22: All: Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.
23: Second Citizen: Consider you what services he has done for his country?
24: First Citizen: Very well; and could be content to give him good
25: report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.
26: Second Citizen: Nay, but speak not maliciously.
27: First Citizen: I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
28: it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
29: content to say it was for his country he did it to
30: please his mother and to be partly proud; which he
31: is, even till the altitude of his virtue.
32: Second Citizen: What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
33: vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
34: First Citizen: If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
35: he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.
36: What shouts are these? The other side o' the city
37: is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!
38: All: Come, come.
39: First Citizen: Soft! who comes here?
40: Second Citizen: Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved
41: the people.
42: First Citizen: He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!
43: MENENIUS: What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you
44: With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.
45: First Citizen: Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have
46: had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,
47: which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor
48: suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
49: have strong arms too.
50: MENENIUS: Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
51: Will you undo yourselves?
52: First Citizen: We cannot, sir, we are undone already.
53: MENENIUS: I tell you, friends, most charitable care
54: Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
55: Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
56: Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
57: Against the Roman state, whose course will on
58: The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
59: Of more strong link asunder than can ever
60: Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
61: The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
62: Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
63: You are transported by calamity
64: Thither where more attends you, and you slander
65: The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,
66: When you curse them as enemies.
67: First Citizen: Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us
68: yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses
69: crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to
70: support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act
71: established against the rich, and provide more
72: piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain
73: the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and
74: there's all the love they bear us.
75: MENENIUS: Either you must
76: Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
77: Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
78: A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;
79: But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
80: To stale 't a little more.
81: First Citizen: Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to
82: fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please
83: you, deliver.
84: MENENIUS: There was a time when all the body's members
85: Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:
86: That only like a gulf it did remain
87: I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,
88: Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
89: Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments
90: Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
91: And, mutually participate, did minister
92: Unto the appetite and affection common
93: Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--
94: First Citizen: Well, sir, what answer made the belly?
95: MENENIUS: Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
96: Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
97: For, look you, I may make the belly smile
98: As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
99: To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
100: That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
101: As you malign our senators for that
102: They are not such as you.
103: First Citizen: Your belly's answer? What!
104: The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,
105: The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
106: Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.
107: With other muniments and petty helps
108: In this our fabric, if that they--
109: MENENIUS: What then?
110: 'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?
111: First Citizen: Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
112: Who is the sink o' the body,--
113: MENENIUS: Well, what then?
114: First Citizen: The former agents, if they did complain,
115: What could the belly answer?
116: MENENIUS: I will tell you
117: If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--
118: Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.
119: First Citizen: Ye're long about it.
120: MENENIUS: Note me this, good friend;
121: Your most grave belly was deliberate,
122: Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:
123: 'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,
124: 'That I receive the general food at first,
125: Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
126: Because I am the store-house and the shop
127: Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,
128: I send it through the rivers of your blood,
129: Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;
130: And, through the cranks and offices of man,
131: The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
132: From me receive that natural competency
133: Whereby they live: and though that all at once,
134: You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--
135: First Citizen: Ay, sir; well, well.
136: MENENIUS: 'Though all at once cannot
137: See what I do deliver out to each,
138: Yet I can make my audit up, that all
139: From me do back receive the flour of all,
140: And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?
141: First Citizen: It was an answer: how apply you this?
142: MENENIUS: The senators of Rome are this good belly,
143: And you the mutinous members; for examine
144: Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
145: Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find
146: No public benefit which you receive
147: But it proceeds or comes from them to you
148: And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
149: You, the great toe of this assembly?
150: First Citizen: I the great toe! why the great toe?
151: MENENIUS: For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,
152: Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:
153: Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
154: Lead'st first to win some vantage.
155: But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
156: Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
157: The one side must have bale.
158: Hail, noble Marcius!
159: MARCIUS: Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,
160: That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
161: Make yourselves scabs?
162: First Citizen: We have ever your good word.
163: MARCIUS: He that will give good words to thee will flatter
164: Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
165: That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,
166: The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
167: Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
168: Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,
169: Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
170: Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
171: To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
172: And curse that justice did it.
173: Who deserves greatness
174: Deserves your hate; and your affections are
175: A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
176: Which would increase his evil. He that depends
177: Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
178: And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?
179: With every minute you do change a mind,
180: And call him noble that was now your hate,
181: Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,
182: That in these several places of the city
183: You cry against the noble senate, who,
184: Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
185: Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
186: MENENIUS: For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,
187: The city is well stored.
188: MARCIUS: Hang 'em! They say!
189: They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know
190: What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,
191: Who thrives and who declines; side factions
192: and give out
193: Conjectural marriages; making parties strong
194: And feebling such as stand not in their liking
195: Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's
196: grain enough!
197: Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
198: And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry
199: With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
200: As I could pick my lance.
201: MENENIUS: Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
202: For though abundantly they lack discretion,
203: Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
204: What says the other troop?
205: MARCIUS: They are dissolved: hang 'em!
206: They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,
207: That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
208: That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
209: Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
210: They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
211: And a petition granted them, a strange one--
212: To break the heart of generosity,
213: And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps
214: As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,
215: Shouting their emulation.
216: MENENIUS: What is granted them?
217: MARCIUS: Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
218: Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
219: Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!
220: The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,
221: Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
222: Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
223: For insurrection's arguing.
224: MENENIUS: This is strange.
225: MARCIUS: Go, get you home, you fragments!
226: Messenger: Where's Caius Marcius?
227: MARCIUS: Here: what's the matter?
228: Messenger: The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.
229: MARCIUS: I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent
230: Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.
231: First Senator: Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
232: The Volsces are in arms.
233: MARCIUS: They have a leader,
234: Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.
235: I sin in envying his nobility,
236: And were I any thing but what I am,
237: I would wish me only he.
238: COMINIUS: You have fought together.
239: MARCIUS: Were half to half the world by the ears and he.
240: Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
241: Only my wars with him: he is a lion
242: That I am proud to hunt.
243: First Senator: Then, worthy Marcius,
244: Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
245: COMINIUS: It is your former promise.
246: MARCIUS: Sir, it is;
247: And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
248: Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
249: What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?
250: TITUS: No, Caius Marcius;
251: I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,
252: Ere stay behind this business.
253: MENENIUS: O, true-bred!
254: First Senator: Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,
255: Our greatest friends attend us.
256: TITUS: [To COMINIUS] Lead you on.
257: Right worthy you priority.
258: COMINIUS: Noble Marcius!
259: First Senator: [To the Citizens] Hence to your homes; be gone!
260: MARCIUS: Nay, let them follow:
261: The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
262: To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
263: Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.
264: SICINIUS: Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
265: BRUTUS: He has no equal.
266: SICINIUS: When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--
267: BRUTUS: Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
268: SICINIUS: Nay. but his taunts.
269: BRUTUS: Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.
270: SICINIUS: Be-mock the modest moon.
271: BRUTUS: The present wars devour him: he is grown
272: Too proud to be so valiant.
273: SICINIUS: Such a nature,
274: Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
275: Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
276: His insolence can brook to be commanded
277: Under Cominius.
278: BRUTUS: Fame, at the which he aims,
279: In whom already he's well graced, can not
280: Better be held nor more attain'd than by
281: A place below the first: for what miscarries
282: Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
283: To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure
284: Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
285: Had borne the business!'
286: SICINIUS: Besides, if things go well,
287: Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
288: Of his demerits rob Cominius.
289: BRUTUS: Come:
290: Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.
291: Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults
292: To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
293: In aught he merit not.
294: SICINIUS: Let's hence, and hear
295: How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
296: More than his singularity, he goes
297: Upon this present action.
298: BRUTUS: Lets along.
ACT 1 SCENE 10

1: AUFIDIUS: The town is ta'en!
2: First Soldier: 'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.
3: AUFIDIUS: Condition!
4: I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
5: Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!
6: What good condition can a treaty find
7: I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
8: I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,
9: And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
10: As often as we eat. By the elements,
11: If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
12: He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
13: Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
14: I thought to crush him in an equal force,
15: True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way
16: Or wrath or craft may get him.
17: First Soldier: He's the devil.
18: AUFIDIUS: Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
19: With only suffering stain by him; for him
20: Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
21: Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
22: The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
23: Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
24: Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
25: My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it
26: At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
27: Against the hospitable canon, would I
28: Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;
29: Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must
30: Be hostages for Rome.
31: First Soldier: Will not you go?
32: AUFIDIUS: I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--
33: 'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither
34: How the world goes, that to the pace of it
35: I may spur on my journey.
ACT 1 SCENE 2

1: First Senator: So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
2: That they of Rome are entered in our counsels
3: And know how we proceed.
4: AUFIDIUS: Is it not yours?
5: What ever have been thought on in this state,
6: That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
7: Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
8: Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
9: I have the letter here; yes, here it is.
10: 'They have press'd a power, but it is not known
11: Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;
12: The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
13: Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
14: Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
15: And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
16: These three lead on this preparation
17: Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
18: Consider of it.'
19: First Senator: Our army's in the field
20: We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
21: To answer us.
22: AUFIDIUS: Nor did you think it folly
23: To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
24: They needs must show themselves; which
25: in the hatching,
26: It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.
27: We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was
28: To take in many towns ere almost Rome
29: Should know we were afoot.
30: Second Senator: Noble Aufidius,
31: Take your commission; hie you to your bands:
32: Let us alone to guard Corioli:
33: If they set down before 's, for the remove
34: Bring your army; but, I think, you'll find
35: They've not prepared for us.
36: AUFIDIUS: O, doubt not that;
37: I speak from certainties. Nay, more,
38: Some parcels of their power are forth already,
39: And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
40: If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
41: 'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
42: Till one can do no more.
43: All: The gods assist you!
44: AUFIDIUS: And keep your honours safe!
45: First Senator: Farewell.
46: Second Senator: Farewell.
47: All: Farewell.
ACT 1 SCENE 3

1: VOLUMNIA: I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a
2: more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I
3: should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
4: won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
5: he would show most love. When yet he was but
6: tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when
7: youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
8: for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not
9: sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering
10: how honour would become such a person. that it was
11: no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if
12: renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
13: danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel
14: war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows
15: bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not
16: more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
17: than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
18: man.
19: VIRGILIA: But had he died in the business, madam; how then?
20: VOLUMNIA: Then his good report should have been my son; I
21: therein would have found issue. Hear me profess
22: sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love
23: alike and none less dear than thine and my good
24: Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their
25: country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
26: Gentlewoman: Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.
27: VIRGILIA: Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
28: VOLUMNIA: Indeed, you shall not.
29: Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,
30: See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,
31: As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:
32: Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
33: 'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
34: Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow
35: With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
36: Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
37: Or all or lose his hire.
38: VIRGILIA: His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!
39: VOLUMNIA: Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
40: Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
41: When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
42: Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
43: At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,
44: We are fit to bid her welcome.
45: VIRGILIA: Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!
46: VOLUMNIA: He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee
47: And tread upon his neck.
48: VALERIA: My ladies both, good day to you.
49: VOLUMNIA: Sweet madam.
50: VIRGILIA: I am glad to see your ladyship.
51: VALERIA: How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.
52: What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good
53: faith. How does your little son?
54: VIRGILIA: I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.
55: VOLUMNIA: He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than
56: look upon his school-master.
57: VALERIA: O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a
58: very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'
59: Wednesday half an hour together: has such a
60: confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded
61: butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go
62: again; and after it again; and over and over he
63: comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his
64: fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his
65: teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked
66: it!
67: VOLUMNIA: One on 's father's moods.
68: VALERIA: Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.
69: VIRGILIA: A crack, madam.
70: VALERIA: Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play
71: the idle husewife with me this afternoon.
72: VIRGILIA: No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
73: VALERIA: Not out of doors!
74: VOLUMNIA: She shall, she shall.
75: VIRGILIA: Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the
76: threshold till my lord return from the wars.
77: VALERIA: Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,
78: you must go visit the good lady that lies in.
79: VIRGILIA: I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with
80: my prayers; but I cannot go thither.
81: VOLUMNIA: Why, I pray you?
82: VIRGILIA: 'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.
83: VALERIA: You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all
84: the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill
85: Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric
86: were sensible as your finger, that you might leave
87: pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.
88: VIRGILIA: No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.
89: VALERIA: In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you
90: excellent news of your husband.
91: VIRGILIA: O, good madam, there can be none yet.
92: VALERIA: Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from
93: him last night.
94: VIRGILIA: Indeed, madam?
95: VALERIA: In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.
96: Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against
97: whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of
98: our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set
99: down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt
100: prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
101: on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.
102: VIRGILIA: Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every
103: thing hereafter.
104: VOLUMNIA: Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but
105: disease our better mirth.
106: VALERIA: In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.
107: Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy
108: solemness out o' door. and go along with us.
109: VIRGILIA: No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish
110: you much mirth.
111: VALERIA: Well, then, farewell.
ACT 1 SCENE 4

1: MARCIUS: Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.
2: LARTIUS: My horse to yours, no.
3: MARCIUS: 'Tis done.
4: LARTIUS: Agreed.
5: MARCIUS: Say, has our general met the enemy?
6: Messenger: They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.
7: LARTIUS: So, the good horse is mine.
8: MARCIUS: I'll buy him of you.
9: LARTIUS: No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
10: For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
11: MARCIUS: How far off lie these armies?
12: Messenger: Within this mile and half.
13: MARCIUS: Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
14: Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
15: That we with smoking swords may march from hence,
16: To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
17: Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?
18: First Senator: No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
19: That's lesser than a little.
20: Hark! our drums
21: Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,
22: Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,
23: Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;
24: They'll open of themselves.
25: Hark you. far off!
26: There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes
27: Amongst your cloven army.
28: MARCIUS: O, they are at it!
29: LARTIUS: Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!
30: MARCIUS: They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
31: Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
32: With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
33: brave Titus:
34: They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
35: Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:
36: He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,
37: And he shall feel mine edge.
38: All the contagion of the south light on you,
39: You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues
40: Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
41: Further than seen and one infect another
42: Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
43: That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
44: From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
45: All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
46: With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
47: Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
48: And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;
49: If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,
50: As they us to our trenches followed.
51: So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:
52: 'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
53: Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.
54: First Soldier: Fool-hardiness; not I.
55: Second Soldier: Nor I.
56: First Soldier: See, they have shut him in.
57: All: To the pot, I warrant him.
58: LARTIUS: What is become of Marcius?
59: All: Slain, sir, doubtless.
60: First Soldier: Following the fliers at the very heels,
61: With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
62: Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,
63: To answer all the city.
64: LARTIUS: O noble fellow!
65: Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
66: And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:
67: A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
68: Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
69: Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
70: Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and
71: The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,
72: Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world
73: Were feverous and did tremble.
74: First Soldier: Look, sir.
75: LARTIUS: O,'tis Marcius!
76: Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
ACT 1 SCENE 5

1: First Roman: This will I carry to Rome.
2: Second Roman: And I this.
3: Third Roman: A murrain on't! I took this for silver.
4: MARCIUS: See here these movers that do prize their hours
5: At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,
6: Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
7: Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
8: Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!
9: And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
10: There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
11: Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take
12: Convenient numbers to make good the city;
13: Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
14: To help Cominius.
15: LARTIUS: Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
16: Thy exercise hath been too violent for
17: A second course of fight.
18: MARCIUS: Sir, praise me not;
19: My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:
20: The blood I drop is rather physical
21: Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
22: I will appear, and fight.
23: LARTIUS: Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
24: Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
25: Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
26: Prosperity be thy page!
27: MARCIUS: Thy friend no less
28: Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell.
29: LARTIUS: Thou worthiest Marcius!
30: Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;
31: Call thither all the officers o' the town,
32: Where they shall know our mind: away!
ACT 1 SCENE 6

1: COMINIUS: Breathe you, my friends: well fought;
2: we are come off
3: Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,
4: Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,
5: We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,
6: By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
7: The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!
8: Lead their successes as we wish our own,
9: That both our powers, with smiling
10: fronts encountering,
11: May give you thankful sacrifice.
12: Thy news?
13: Messenger: The citizens of Corioli have issued,
14: And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
15: I saw our party to their trenches driven,
16: And then I came away.
17: COMINIUS: Though thou speak'st truth,
18: Methinks thou speak'st not well.
19: How long is't since?
20: Messenger: Above an hour, my lord.
21: COMINIUS: 'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:
22: How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
23: And bring thy news so late?
24: Messenger: Spies of the Volsces
25: Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
26: Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
27: Half an hour since brought my report.
28: COMINIUS: Who's yonder,
29: That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
30: He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
31: Before-time seen him thus.
32: MARCIUS: [Within] Come I too late?
33: COMINIUS: The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
34: More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
35: From every meaner man.
36: MARCIUS: Come I too late?
37: COMINIUS: Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
38: But mantled in your own.
39: MARCIUS: O, let me clip ye
40: In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
41: As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
42: And tapers burn'd to bedward!
43: COMINIUS: Flower of warriors,
44: How is it with Titus Lartius?
45: MARCIUS: As with a man busied about decrees:
46: Condemning some to death, and some to exile;
47: Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;
48: Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
49: Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
50: To let him slip at will.
51: COMINIUS: Where is that slave
52: Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
53: Where is he? call him hither.
54: MARCIUS: Let him alone;
55: He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,
56: The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--
57: The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
58: From rascals worse than they.
59: COMINIUS: But how prevail'd you?
60: MARCIUS: Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
61: Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?
62: If not, why cease you till you are so?
63: COMINIUS: Marcius,
64: We have at disadvantage fought and did
65: Retire to win our purpose.
66: MARCIUS: How lies their battle? know you on which side
67: They have placed their men of trust?
68: COMINIUS: As I guess, Marcius,
69: Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,
70: Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
71: Their very heart of hope.
72: MARCIUS: I do beseech you,
73: By all the battles wherein we have fought,
74: By the blood we have shed together, by the vows
75: We have made to endure friends, that you directly
76: Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
77: And that you not delay the present, but,
78: Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
79: We prove this very hour.
80: COMINIUS: Though I could wish
81: You were conducted to a gentle bath
82: And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
83: Deny your asking: take your choice of those
84: That best can aid your action.
85: MARCIUS: Those are they
86: That most are willing. If any such be here--
87: As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting
88: Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
89: Lesser his person than an ill report;
90: If any think brave death outweighs bad life
91: And that his country's dearer than himself;
92: Let him alone, or so many so minded,
93: Wave thus, to express his disposition,
94: And follow Marcius.
95: O, me alone! make you a sword of me?
96: If these shows be not outward, which of you
97: But is four Volsces? none of you but is
98: Able to bear against the great Aufidius
99: A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
100: Though thanks to all, must I select
101: from all: the rest
102: Shall bear the business in some other fight,
103: As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;
104: And four shall quickly draw out my command,
105: Which men are best inclined.
106: COMINIUS: March on, my fellows:
107: Make good this ostentation, and you shall
108: Divide in all with us.
ACT 1 SCENE 7

1: LARTIUS: So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
2: As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
3: Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve
4: For a short holding: if we lose the field,
5: We cannot keep the town.
6: Lieutenant: Fear not our care, sir.
7: LARTIUS: Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
8: Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.
ACT 1 SCENE 8

1: MARCIUS: I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee
2: Worse than a promise-breaker.
3: AUFIDIUS: We hate alike:
4: Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
5: More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.
6: MARCIUS: Let the first budger die the other's slave,
7: And the gods doom him after!
8: AUFIDIUS: If I fly, Marcius,
9: Holloa me like a hare.
10: MARCIUS: Within these three hours, Tullus,
11: Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
12: And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
13: Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
14: Wrench up thy power to the highest.
15: AUFIDIUS: Wert thou the Hector
16: That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
17: Thou shouldst not scape me here.
18: Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me
19: In your condemned seconds.
ACT 1 SCENE 9

1: COMINIUS: If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
2: Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it
3: Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,
4: Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,
5: I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,
6: And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the
7: dull tribunes,
8: That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,
9: Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
10: Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
11: Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,
12: Having fully dined before.
13: LARTIUS: O general,
14: Here is the steed, we the caparison:
15: Hadst thou beheld--
16: MARCIUS: Pray now, no more: my mother,
17: Who has a charter to extol her blood,
18: When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
19: As you have done; that's what I can; induced
20: As you have been; that's for my country:
21: He that has but effected his good will
22: Hath overta'en mine act.
23: COMINIUS: You shall not be
24: The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
25: The value of her own: 'twere a concealment
26: Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
27: To hide your doings; and to silence that,
28: Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
29: Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you
30: In sign of what you are, not to reward
31: What you have done--before our army hear me.
32: MARCIUS: I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
33: To hear themselves remember'd.
34: COMINIUS: Should they not,
35: Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
36: And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,
37: Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all
38: The treasure in this field achieved and city,
39: We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
40: Before the common distribution, at
41: Your only choice.
42: MARCIUS: I thank you, general;
43: But cannot make my heart consent to take
44: A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;
45: And stand upon my common part with those
46: That have beheld the doing.
47: May these same instruments, which you profane,
48: Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall
49: I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
50: Made all of false-faced soothing!
51: When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,
52: Let him be made a coverture for the wars!
53: No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd
54: My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--
55: Which, without note, here's many else have done,--
56: You shout me forth
57: In acclamations hyperbolical;
58: As if I loved my little should be dieted
59: In praises sauced with lies.
60: COMINIUS: Too modest are you;
61: More cruel to your good report than grateful
62: To us that give you truly: by your patience,
63: If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,
64: Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,
65: Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,
66: As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius
67: Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,
68: My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
69: With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
70: For what he did before Corioli, call him,
71: With all the applause and clamour of the host,
72: CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear
73: The addition nobly ever!
74: All: Caius Marcius Coriolanus!
75: CORIOLANUS: I will go wash;
76: And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
77: Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.
78: I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
79: To undercrest your good addition
80: To the fairness of my power.
81: COMINIUS: So, to our tent;
82: Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
83: To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
84: Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
85: The best, with whom we may articulate,
86: For their own good and ours.
87: LARTIUS: I shall, my lord.
88: CORIOLANUS: The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
89: Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
90: Of my lord general.
91: COMINIUS: Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?
92: CORIOLANUS: I sometime lay here in Corioli
93: At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
94: He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
95: But then Aufidius was with in my view,
96: And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
97: To give my poor host freedom.
98: COMINIUS: O, well begg'd!
99: Were he the butcher of my son, he should
100: Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.
101: LARTIUS: Marcius, his name?
102: CORIOLANUS: By Jupiter! forgot.
103: I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
104: Have we no wine here?
105: COMINIUS: Go we to our tent:
106: The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
107: It should be look'd to: come.
ACT 2 SCENE 1

1: MENENIUS: The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.
2: BRUTUS: Good or bad?
3: MENENIUS: Not according to the prayer of the people, for they
4: love not Marcius.
5: SICINIUS: Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
6: MENENIUS: Pray you, who does the wolf love?
7: SICINIUS: The lamb.
8: MENENIUS: Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the
9: noble Marcius.
10: BRUTUS: He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.
11: MENENIUS: He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two
12: are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.
13: Both: Well, sir.
14: MENENIUS: In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two
15: have not in abundance?
16: BRUTUS: He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.
17: SICINIUS: Especially in pride.
18: BRUTUS: And topping all others in boasting.
19: MENENIUS: This is strange now: do you two know how you are
20: censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the
21: right-hand file? do you?
22: Both: Why, how are we censured?
23: MENENIUS: Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?
24: Both: Well, well, sir, well.
25: MENENIUS: Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of
26: occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:
27: give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at
28: your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a
29: pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for
30: being proud?
31: BRUTUS: We do it not alone, sir.
32: MENENIUS: I know you can do very little alone; for your helps
33: are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous
34: single: your abilities are too infant-like for
35: doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you
36: could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,
37: and make but an interior survey of your good selves!
38: O that you could!
39: BRUTUS: What then, sir?
40: MENENIUS: Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
41: proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as
42: any in Rome.
43: SICINIUS: Menenius, you are known well enough too.
44: MENENIUS: I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that
45: loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
46: Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in
47: favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like
48: upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
49: with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
50: of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my
51: malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as
52: you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink
53: you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a
54: crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have
55: delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in
56: compound with the major part of your syllables: and
57: though I must be content to bear with those that say
58: you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that
59: tell you you have good faces. If you see this in
60: the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known
61: well enough too? what barm can your bisson
62: conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be
63: known well enough too?
64: BRUTUS: Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
65: MENENIUS: You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You
66: are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you
67: wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
68: cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
69: and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
70: second day of audience. When you are hearing a
71: matter between party and party, if you chance to be
72: pinched with the colic, you make faces like
73: mummers; set up the bloody flag against all
74: patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,
75: dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
76: by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
77: cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are
78: a pair of strange ones.
79: BRUTUS: Come, come, you are well understood to be a
80: perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
81: bencher in the Capitol.
82: MENENIUS: Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
83: encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
84: you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the
85: wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not
86: so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
87: cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-
88: saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;
89: who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors
90: since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the
91: best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
92: your worships: more of your conversation would
93: infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
94: plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.
95: How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,
96: were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow
97: your eyes so fast?
98: VOLUMNIA: Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for
99: the love of Juno, let's go.
100: MENENIUS: Ha! Marcius coming home!
101: VOLUMNIA: Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous
102: approbation.
103: MENENIUS: Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!
104: Marcius coming home!
105: VIRGILIA: Nay,'tis true.
106: VOLUMNIA: Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
107: another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one
108: at home for you.
109: MENENIUS: I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for
110: me!
111: VIRGILIA: Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.
112: MENENIUS: A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven
113: years' health; in which time I will make a lip at
114: the physician: the most sovereign prescription in
115: Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,
116: of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
117: not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.
118: VIRGILIA: O, no, no, no.
119: VOLUMNIA: O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.
120: MENENIUS: So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'
121: victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.
122: VOLUMNIA: On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home
123: with the oaken garland.
124: MENENIUS: Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
125: VOLUMNIA: Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but
126: Aufidius got off.
127: MENENIUS: And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:
128: an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so
129: fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold
130: that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?
131: VOLUMNIA: Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate
132: has letters from the general, wherein he gives my
133: son the whole name of the war: he hath in this
134: action outdone his former deeds doubly
135: VALERIA: In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
136: MENENIUS: Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his
137: true purchasing.
138: VIRGILIA: The gods grant them true!
139: VOLUMNIA: True! pow, wow.
140: MENENIUS: True! I'll be sworn they are true.
141: Where is he wounded?
142: God save your good worships! Marcius is coming
143: home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?
144: VOLUMNIA: I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be
145: large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall
146: stand for his place. He received in the repulse of
147: Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.
148: MENENIUS: One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's
149: nine that I know.
150: VOLUMNIA: He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five
151: wounds upon him.
152: MENENIUS: Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.
153: Hark! the trumpets.
154: VOLUMNIA: These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he
155: carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
156: Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;
157: Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
158: Herald: Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
159: Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,
160: With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these
161: In honour follows Coriolanus.
162: Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
163: All: Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
164: CORIOLANUS: No more of this; it does offend my heart:
165: Pray now, no more.
166: COMINIUS: Look, sir, your mother!
167: CORIOLANUS: O,
168: You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
169: For my prosperity!
170: VOLUMNIA: Nay, my good soldier, up;
171: My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
172: By deed-achieving honour newly named,--
173: What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--
174: But O, thy wife!
175: CORIOLANUS: My gracious silence, hail!
176: Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
177: That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,
178: Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
179: And mothers that lack sons.
180: MENENIUS: Now, the gods crown thee!
181: CORIOLANUS: And live you yet?
182: O my sweet lady, pardon.
183: VOLUMNIA: I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:
184: And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.
185: MENENIUS: A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
186: And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.
187: A curse begin at very root on's heart,
188: That is not glad to see thee! You are three
189: That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,
190: We have some old crab-trees here
191: at home that will not
192: Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:
193: We call a nettle but a nettle and
194: The faults of fools but folly.
195: COMINIUS: Ever right.
196: CORIOLANUS: Menenius ever, ever.
197: Herald: Give way there, and go on!
198: CORIOLANUS: [To VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA] Your hand, and yours:
199: Ere in our own house I do shade my head,
200: The good patricians must be visited;
201: From whom I have received not only greetings,
202: But with them change of honours.
203: VOLUMNIA: I have lived
204: To see inherited my very wishes
205: And the buildings of my fancy: only
206: There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
207: Our Rome will cast upon thee.
208: CORIOLANUS: Know, good mother,
209: I had rather be their servant in my way,
210: Than sway with them in theirs.
211: COMINIUS: On, to the Capitol!
212: BRUTUS: All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
213: Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
214: Into a rapture lets her baby cry
215: While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
216: Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
217: Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,
218: Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed
219: With variable complexions, all agreeing
220: In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
221: Do press among the popular throngs and puff
222: To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
223: Commit the war of white and damask in
224: Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
225: Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
226: As if that whatsoever god who leads him
227: Were slily crept into his human powers
228: And gave him graceful posture.
229: SICINIUS: On the sudden,
230: I warrant him consul.
231: BRUTUS: Then our office may,
232: During his power, go sleep.
233: SICINIUS: He cannot temperately transport his honours
234: From where he should begin and end, but will
235: Lose those he hath won.
236: BRUTUS: In that there's comfort.
237: SICINIUS: Doubt not
238: The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
239: Upon their ancient malice will forget
240: With the least cause these his new honours, which
241: That he will give them make I as little question
242: As he is proud to do't.
243: BRUTUS: I heard him swear,
244: Were he to stand for consul, never would he
245: Appear i' the market-place nor on him put
246: The napless vesture of humility;
247: Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
248: To the people, beg their stinking breaths.
249: SICINIUS: 'Tis right.
250: BRUTUS: It was his word: O, he would miss it rather
251: Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,
252: And the desire of the nobles.
253: SICINIUS: I wish no better
254: Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
255: In execution.
256: BRUTUS: 'Tis most like he will.
257: SICINIUS: It shall be to him then as our good wills,
258: A sure destruction.
259: BRUTUS: So it must fall out
260: To him or our authorities. For an end,
261: We must suggest the people in what hatred
262: He still hath held them; that to's power he would
263: Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and
264: Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,
265: In human action and capacity,
266: Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
267: Than camels in the war, who have their provand
268: Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
269: For sinking under them.
270: SICINIUS: This, as you say, suggested
271: At some time when his soaring insolence
272: Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
273: If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy
274: As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire
275: To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
276: Shall darken him for ever.
277: BRUTUS: What's the matter?
278: Messenger: You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
279: That Marcius shall be consul:
280: I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
281: The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
282: Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
283: Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,
284: As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
285: A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:
286: I never saw the like.
287: BRUTUS: Let's to the Capitol;
288: And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
289: But hearts for the event.
290: SICINIUS: Have with you.
ACT 2 SCENE 2

1: First Officer: Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand
2: for consulships?
3: Second Officer: Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one
4: Coriolanus will carry it.
5: First Officer: That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and
6: loves not the common people.
7: Second Officer: Faith, there had been many great men that have
8: flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there
9: be many that they have loved, they know not
10: wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,
11: they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for
12: Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
13: him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
14: disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets
15: them plainly see't.
16: First Officer: If he did not care whether he had their love or no,
17: he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither
18: good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater
19: devotion than can render it him; and leaves
20: nothing undone that may fully discover him their
21: opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and
22: displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
23: dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
24: Second Officer: He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his
25: ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,
26: having been supple and courteous to the people,
27: bonneted, without any further deed to have them at
28: an into their estimation and report: but he hath so
29: planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions
30: in their hearts, that for their tongues to be
31: silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of
32: ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a
33: malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck
34: reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.
35: First Officer: No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they
36: are coming.
37: MENENIUS: Having determined of the Volsces and
38: To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,
39: As the main point of this our after-meeting,
40: To gratify his noble service that
41: Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,
42: please you,
43: Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
44: The present consul, and last general
45: In our well-found successes, to report
46: A little of that worthy work perform'd
47: By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom
48: We met here both to thank and to remember
49: With honours like himself.
50: First Senator: Speak, good Cominius:
51: Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
52: Rather our state's defective for requital
53: Than we to stretch it out.
54: Masters o' the people,
55: We do request your kindest ears, and after,
56: Your loving motion toward the common body,
57: To yield what passes here.
58: SICINIUS: We are convented
59: Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
60: Inclinable to honour and advance
61: The theme of our assembly.
62: BRUTUS: Which the rather
63: We shall be blest to do, if he remember
64: A kinder value of the people than
65: He hath hereto prized them at.
66: MENENIUS: That's off, that's off;
67: I would you rather had been silent. Please you
68: To hear Cominius speak?
69: BRUTUS: Most willingly;
70: But yet my caution was more pertinent
71: Than the rebuke you give it.
72: MENENIUS: He loves your people
73: But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
74: Worthy Cominius, speak.
75: Nay, keep your place.
76: First Senator: Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear
77: What you have nobly done.
78: CORIOLANUS: Your horror's pardon:
79: I had rather have my wounds to heal again
80: Than hear say how I got them.
81: BRUTUS: Sir, I hope
82: My words disbench'd you not.
83: CORIOLANUS: No, sir: yet oft,
84: When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
85: You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but
86: your people,
87: I love them as they weigh.
88: MENENIUS: Pray now, sit down.
89: CORIOLANUS: I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
90: When the alarum were struck than idly sit
91: To hear my nothings monster'd.
92: MENENIUS: Masters of the people,
93: Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--
94: That's thousand to one good one--when you now see
95: He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
96: Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.
97: COMINIUS: I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
98: Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
99: That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
100: Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
101: The man I speak of cannot in the world
102: Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
103: When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
104: Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,
105: Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
106: When with his Amazonian chin he drove
107: The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
108: An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
109: Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
110: And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
111: When he might act the woman in the scene,
112: He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed
113: Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
114: Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,
115: And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
116: He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
117: Before and in Corioli, let me say,
118: I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;
119: And by his rare example made the coward
120: Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
121: A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
122: And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
123: Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
124: He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
125: Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
126: The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
127: With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
128: And with a sudden reinforcement struck
129: Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
130: When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce
131: His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
132: Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
133: And to the battle came he; where he did
134: Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
135: 'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
136: Both field and city ours, he never stood
137: To ease his breast with panting.
138: MENENIUS: Worthy man!
139: First Senator: He cannot but with measure fit the honours
140: Which we devise him.
141: COMINIUS: Our spoils he kick'd at,
142: And look'd upon things precious as they were
143: The common muck of the world: he covets less
144: Than misery itself would give; rewards
145: His deeds with doing them, and is content
146: To spend the time to end it.
147: MENENIUS: He's right noble:
148: Let him be call'd for.
149: First Senator: Call Coriolanus.
150: Officer: He doth appear.
151: MENENIUS: The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
152: To make thee consul.
153: CORIOLANUS: I do owe them still
154: My life and services.
155: MENENIUS: It then remains
156: That you do speak to the people.
157: CORIOLANUS: I do beseech you,
158: Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
159: Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,
160: For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you
161: That I may pass this doing.
162: SICINIUS: Sir, the people
163: Must have their voices; neither will they bate
164: One jot of ceremony.
165: MENENIUS: Put them not to't:
166: Pray you, go fit you to the custom and
167: Take to you, as your predecessors have,
168: Your honour with your form.
169: CORIOLANUS: It is apart
170: That I shall blush in acting, and might well
171: Be taken from the people.
172: BRUTUS: Mark you that?
173: CORIOLANUS: To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
174: Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
175: As if I had received them for the hire
176: Of their breath only!
177: MENENIUS: Do not stand upon't.
178: We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,
179: Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul
180: Wish we all joy and honour.
181: Senators: To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
182: BRUTUS: You see how he intends to use the people.
183: SICINIUS: May they perceive's intent! He will require them,
184: As if he did contemn what he requested
185: Should be in them to give.
186: BRUTUS: Come, we'll inform them
187: Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,
188: I know, they do attend us.
ACT 2 SCENE 3

1: First Citizen: Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.
2: Second Citizen: We may, sir, if we will.
3: Third Citizen: We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a
4: power that we have no power to do; for if he show us
5: his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our
6: tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if
7: he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him
8: our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
9: monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,
10: were to make a monster of the multitude: of the
11: which we being members, should bring ourselves to be
12: monstrous members.
13: First Citizen: And to make us no better thought of, a little help
14: will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he
15: himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.
16: Third Citizen: We have been called so of many; not that our heads
17: are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
18: but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and
19: truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of
20: one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,
21: and their consent of one direct way should be at
22: once to all the points o' the compass.
23: Second Citizen: Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
24: fly?
25: Third Citizen: Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
26: will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but
27: if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.
28: Second Citizen: Why that way?
29: Third Citizen: To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts
30: melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return
31: for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.
32: Second Citizen: You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.
33: Third Citizen: Are you all resolved to give your voices? But
34: that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I
35: say, if he would incline to the people, there was
36: never a worthier man.
37: Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his
38: behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to
39: come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and
40: by threes. He's to make his requests by
41: particulars; wherein every one of us has a single
42: honour, in giving him our own voices with our own
43: tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how
44: you shall go by him.
45: All: Content, content.
46: MENENIUS: O sir, you are not right: have you not known
47: The worthiest men have done't?
48: CORIOLANUS: What must I say?
49: 'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring
50: My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!
51: I got them in my country's service, when
52: Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
53: From the noise of our own drums.'
54: MENENIUS: O me, the gods!
55: You must not speak of that: you must desire them
56: To think upon you.
57: CORIOLANUS: Think upon me! hang 'em!
58: I would they would forget me, like the virtues
59: Which our divines lose by 'em.
60: MENENIUS: You'll mar all:
61: I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,
62: In wholesome manner.
63: CORIOLANUS: Bid them wash their faces
64: And keep their teeth clean.
65: So, here comes a brace.
66: You know the cause, air, of my standing here.
67: Third Citizen: We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.
68: CORIOLANUS: Mine own desert.
69: Second Citizen: Your own desert!
70: CORIOLANUS: Ay, but not mine own desire.
71: Third Citizen: How not your own desire?
72: CORIOLANUS: No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
73: poor with begging.
74: Third Citizen: You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to
75: gain by you.
76: CORIOLANUS: Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?
77: First Citizen: The price is to ask it kindly.
78: CORIOLANUS: Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to
79: show you, which shall be yours in private. Your
80: good voice, sir; what say you?
81: Second Citizen: You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
82: CORIOLANUS: A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices
83: begged. I have your alms: adieu.
84: Third Citizen: But this is something odd.
85: Second Citizen: An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.
86: CORIOLANUS: Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
87: voices that I may be consul, I have here the
88: customary gown.
89: Fourth Citizen: You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
90: have not deserved nobly.
91: CORIOLANUS: Your enigma?
92: Fourth Citizen: You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have
93: been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved
94: the common people.
95: CORIOLANUS: You should account me the more virtuous that I have
96: not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my
97: sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer
98: estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account
99: gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is
100: rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
101: the insinuating nod and be off to them most
102: counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the
103: bewitchment of some popular man and give it
104: bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,
105: I may be consul.
106: Fifth Citizen: We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
107: you our voices heartily.
108: Fourth Citizen: You have received many wounds for your country.
109: CORIOLANUS: I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
110: will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
111: Both Citizens: The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
112: CORIOLANUS: Most sweet voices!
113: Better it is to die, better to starve,
114: Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
115: Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,
116: To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,
117: Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:
118: What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
119: The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
120: And mountainous error be too highly heapt
121: For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,
122: Let the high office and the honour go
123: To one that would do thus. I am half through;
124: The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.
125: Here come more voices.
126: Your voices: for your voices I have fought;
127: Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear
128: Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
129: I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
130: Done many things, some less, some more your voices:
131: Indeed I would be consul.
132: Sixth Citizen: He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest
133: man's voice.
134: Seventh Citizen: Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,
135: and make him good friend to the people!
136: All Citizens: Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!
137: CORIOLANUS: Worthy voices!
138: MENENIUS: You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes
139: Endue you with the people's voice: remains
140: That, in the official marks invested, you
141: Anon do meet the senate.
142: CORIOLANUS: Is this done?
143: SICINIUS: The custom of request you have discharged:
144: The people do admit you, and are summon'd
145: To meet anon, upon your approbation.
146: CORIOLANUS: Where? at the senate-house?
147: SICINIUS: There, Coriolanus.
148: CORIOLANUS: May I change these garments?
149: SICINIUS: You may, sir.
150: CORIOLANUS: That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
151: Repair to the senate-house.
152: MENENIUS: I'll keep you company. Will you along?
153: BRUTUS: We stay here for the people.
154: SICINIUS: Fare you well.
155: He has it now, and by his looks methink
156: 'Tis warm at 's heart.
157: BRUTUS: With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
158: will you dismiss the people?
159: SICINIUS: How now, my masters! have you chose this man?
160: First Citizen: He has our voices, sir.
161: BRUTUS: We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
162: Second Citizen: Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
163: He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
164: Third Citizen: Certainly
165: He flouted us downright.
166: First Citizen: No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.
167: Second Citizen: Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
168: He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
169: His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.
170: SICINIUS: Why, so he did, I am sure.
171: Citizens: No, no; no man saw 'em.
172: Third Citizen: He said he had wounds, which he could show
173: in private;
174: And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
175: 'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
176: But by your voices, will not so permit me;
177: Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
178: Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:
179: Your most sweet voices: now you have left
180: your voices,
181: I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?
182: SICINIUS: Why either were you ignorant to see't,
183: Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
184: To yield your voices?
185: BRUTUS: Could you not have told him
186: As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
187: But was a petty servant to the state,
188: He was your enemy, ever spake against
189: Your liberties and the charters that you bear
190: I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving
191: A place of potency and sway o' the state,
192: If he should still malignantly remain
193: Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
194: Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
195: That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
196: Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
197: Would think upon you for your voices and
198: Translate his malice towards you into love,
199: Standing your friendly lord.
200: SICINIUS: Thus to have said,
201: As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit
202: And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
203: Either his gracious promise, which you might,
204: As cause had call'd you up, have held him to
205: Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
206: Which easily endures not article
207: Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,
208: You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
209: And pass'd him unelected.
210: BRUTUS: Did you perceive
211: He did solicit you in free contempt
212: When he did need your loves, and do you think
213: That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,
214: When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
215: No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
216: Against the rectorship of judgment?
217: SICINIUS: Have you
218: Ere now denied the asker? and now again
219: Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
220: Your sued-for tongues?
221: Third Citizen: He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.
222: Second Citizen: And will deny him:
223: I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
224: First Citizen: I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.
225: BRUTUS: Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
226: They have chose a consul that will from them take
227: Their liberties; make them of no more voice
228: Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
229: As therefore kept to do so.
230: SICINIUS: Let them assemble,
231: And on a safer judgment all revoke
232: Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,
233: And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
234: With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
235: How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
236: Thinking upon his services, took from you
237: The apprehension of his present portance,
238: Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
239: After the inveterate hate he bears you.
240: BRUTUS: Lay
241: A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,
242: No impediment between, but that you must
243: Cast your election on him.
244: SICINIUS: Say, you chose him
245: More after our commandment than as guided
246: By your own true affections, and that your minds,
247: Preoccupied with what you rather must do
248: Than what you should, made you against the grain
249: To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.
250: BRUTUS: Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.
251: How youngly he began to serve his country,
252: How long continued, and what stock he springs of,
253: The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came
254: That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
255: Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
256: Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
257: That our beat water brought by conduits hither;
258: And [Censorinus,] nobly named so,
259: Twice being [by the people chosen] censor,
260: Was his great ancestor.
261: SICINIUS: One thus descended,
262: That hath beside well in his person wrought
263: To be set high in place, we did commend
264: To your remembrances: but you have found,
265: Scaling his present bearing with his past,
266: That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
267: Your sudden approbation.
268: BRUTUS: Say, you ne'er had done't--
269: Harp on that still--but by our putting on;
270: And presently, when you have drawn your number,
271: Repair to the Capitol.
272: All: We will so: almost all
273: Repent in their election.
274: BRUTUS: Let them go on;
275: This mutiny were better put in hazard,
276: Than stay, past doubt, for greater:
277: If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
278: With their refusal, both observe and answer
279: The vantage of his anger.
ACT 3 SCENE 1

1: CORIOLANUS: Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?
2: LARTIUS: He had, my lord; and that it was which caused
3: Our swifter composition.
4: CORIOLANUS: So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
5: Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
6: Upon's again.
7: COMINIUS: They are worn, lord consul, so,
8: That we shall hardly in our ages see
9: Their banners wave again.
10: CORIOLANUS: Saw you Aufidius?
11: LARTIUS: On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
12: Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
13: Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.
14: CORIOLANUS: Spoke he of me?
15: LARTIUS: He did, my lord.
16: CORIOLANUS: How? what?
17: LARTIUS: How often he had met you, sword to sword;
18: That of all things upon the earth he hated
19: Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes
20: To hopeless restitution, so he might
21: Be call'd your vanquisher.
22: CORIOLANUS: At Antium lives he?
23: LARTIUS: At Antium.
24: CORIOLANUS: I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
25: To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
26: Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
27: The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;
28: For they do prank them in authority,
29: Against all noble sufferance.
30: SICINIUS: Pass no further.
31: CORIOLANUS: Ha! what is that?
32: BRUTUS: It will be dangerous to go on: no further.
33: CORIOLANUS: What makes this change?
34: MENENIUS: The matter?
35: COMINIUS: Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
36: BRUTUS: Cominius, no.
37: CORIOLANUS: Have I had children's voices?
38: First Senator: Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.
39: BRUTUS: The people are incensed against him.
40: SICINIUS: Stop,
41: Or all will fall in broil.
42: CORIOLANUS: Are these your herd?
43: Must these have voices, that can yield them now
44: And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
45: your offices?
46: You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
47: Have you not set them on?
48: MENENIUS: Be calm, be calm.
49: CORIOLANUS: It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
50: To curb the will of the nobility:
51: Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
52: Nor ever will be ruled.
53: BRUTUS: Call't not a plot:
54: The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
55: When corn was given them gratis, you repined;
56: Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
57: Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.
58: CORIOLANUS: Why, this was known before.
59: BRUTUS: Not to them all.
60: CORIOLANUS: Have you inform'd them sithence?
61: BRUTUS: How! I inform them!
62: CORIOLANUS: You are like to do such business.
63: BRUTUS: Not unlike,
64: Each way, to better yours.
65: CORIOLANUS: Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
66: Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
67: Your fellow tribune.
68: SICINIUS: You show too much of that
69: For which the people stir: if you will pass
70: To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
71: Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
72: Or never be so noble as a consul,
73: Nor yoke with him for tribune.
74: MENENIUS: Let's be calm.
75: COMINIUS: The people are abused; set on. This paltering
76: Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus
77: Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
78: I' the plain way of his merit.
79: CORIOLANUS: Tell me of corn!
80: This was my speech, and I will speak't again--
81: MENENIUS: Not now, not now.
82: First Senator: Not in this heat, sir, now.
83: CORIOLANUS: Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
84: I crave their pardons:
85: For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them
86: Regard me as I do not flatter, and
87: Therein behold themselves: I say again,
88: In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
89: The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
90: Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
91: and scatter'd,
92: By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
93: Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
94: Which they have given to beggars.
95: MENENIUS: Well, no more.
96: First Senator: No more words, we beseech you.
97: CORIOLANUS: How! no more!
98: As for my country I have shed my blood,
99: Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
100: Coin words till their decay against those measles,
101: Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought
102: The very way to catch them.
103: BRUTUS: You speak o' the people,
104: As if you were a god to punish, not
105: A man of their infirmity.
106: SICINIUS: 'Twere well
107: We let the people know't.
108: MENENIUS: What, what? his choler?
109: CORIOLANUS: Choler!
110: Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
111: By Jove, 'twould be my mind!
112: SICINIUS: It is a mind
113: That shall remain a poison where it is,
114: Not poison any further.
115: CORIOLANUS: Shall remain!
116: Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
117: His absolute 'shall'?
118: COMINIUS: 'Twas from the canon.
119: CORIOLANUS: 'Shall'!
120: O good but most unwise patricians! why,
121: You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
122: Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
123: That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
124: The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
125: To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
126: And make your channel his? If he have power
127: Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
128: Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
129: Be not as common fools; if you are not,
130: Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
131: If they be senators: and they are no less,
132: When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
133: Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
134: And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
135: His popular 'shall' against a graver bench
136: Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!
137: It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
138: To know, when two authorities are up,
139: Neither supreme, how soon confusion
140: May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
141: The one by the other.
142: COMINIUS: Well, on to the market-place.
143: CORIOLANUS: Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
144: The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
145: Sometime in Greece,--
146: MENENIUS: Well, well, no more of that.
147: CORIOLANUS: Though there the people had more absolute power,
148: I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
149: The ruin of the state.
150: BRUTUS: Why, shall the people give
151: One that speaks thus their voice?
152: CORIOLANUS: I'll give my reasons,
153: More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
154: Was not our recompense, resting well assured
155: That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
156: Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
157: They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
158: Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
159: Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
160: Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
161: Which they have often made against the senate,
162: All cause unborn, could never be the motive
163: Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
164: How shall this bisson multitude digest
165: The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
166: What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;
167: We are the greater poll, and in true fear
168: They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
169: The nature of our seats and make the rabble
170: Call our cares fears; which will in time
171: Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
172: The crows to peck the eagles.
173: MENENIUS: Come, enough.
174: BRUTUS: Enough, with over-measure.
175: CORIOLANUS: No, take more:
176: What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
177: Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
178: Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
179: Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
180: Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
181: Of general ignorance,--it must omit
182: Real necessities, and give way the while
183: To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,
184: it follows,
185: Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--
186: You that will be less fearful than discreet,
187: That love the fundamental part of state
188: More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer
189: A noble life before a long, and wish
190: To jump a body with a dangerous physic
191: That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
192: The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
193: The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
194: Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
195: Of that integrity which should become't,
196: Not having the power to do the good it would,
197: For the in which doth control't.
198: BRUTUS: Has said enough.
199: SICINIUS: Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
200: As traitors do.
201: CORIOLANUS: Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
202: What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
203: On whom depending, their obedience fails
204: To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
205: When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
206: Then were they chosen: in a better hour,
207: Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
208: And throw their power i' the dust.
209: BRUTUS: Manifest treason!
210: SICINIUS: This a consul? no.
211: BRUTUS: The aediles, ho!
212: Let him be apprehended.
213: SICINIUS: Go, call the people:
214: in whose name myself
215: Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
216: A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,
217: And follow to thine answer.
218: CORIOLANUS: Hence, old goat!
219: Senators, & C We'll surety him.
220: COMINIUS: Aged sir, hands off.
221: CORIOLANUS: Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
222: Out of thy garments.
223: SICINIUS: Help, ye citizens!
224: MENENIUS: On both sides more respect.
225: SICINIUS: Here's he that would take from you all your power.
226: BRUTUS: Seize him, AEdiles!
227: Citizens: Down with him! down with him!
228: Senators, & C Weapons, weapons, weapons!
229: 'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'
230: 'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
231: 'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'
232: MENENIUS: What is about to be? I am out of breath;
233: Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes
234: To the people! Coriolanus, patience!
235: Speak, good Sicinius.
236: SICINIUS: Hear me, people; peace!
237: Citizens: Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
238: SICINIUS: You are at point to lose your liberties:
239: Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
240: Whom late you have named for consul.
241: MENENIUS: Fie, fie, fie!
242: This is the way to kindle, not to quench.
243: First Senator: To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.
244: SICINIUS: What is the city but the people?
245: Citizens: True,
246: The people are the city.
247: BRUTUS: By the consent of all, we were establish'd
248: The people's magistrates.
249: Citizens: You so remain.
250: MENENIUS: And so are like to do.
251: COMINIUS: That is the way to lay the city flat;
252: To bring the roof to the foundation,
253: And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,
254: In heaps and piles of ruin.
255: SICINIUS: This deserves death.
256: BRUTUS: Or let us stand to our authority,
257: Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
258: Upon the part o' the people, in whose power
259: We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy
260: Of present death.
261: SICINIUS: Therefore lay hold of him;
262: Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence
263: Into destruction cast him.
264: BRUTUS: AEdiles, seize him!
265: Citizens: Yield, Marcius, yield!
266: MENENIUS: Hear me one word;
267: Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.
268: AEdile: Peace, peace!
269: MENENIUS: [To BRUTUS] Be that you seem, truly your
270: country's friend,
271: And temperately proceed to what you would
272: Thus violently redress.
273: BRUTUS: Sir, those cold ways,
274: That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
275: Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,
276: And bear him to the rock.
277: CORIOLANUS: No, I'll die here.
278: There's some among you have beheld me fighting:
279: Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.
280: MENENIUS: Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.
281: BRUTUS: Lay hands upon him.
282: COMINIUS: Help Marcius, help,
283: You that be noble; help him, young and old!
284: Citizens: Down with him, down with him!
285: MENENIUS: Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!
286: All will be naught else.
287: Second Senator: Get you gone.
288: COMINIUS: Stand fast;
289: We have as many friends as enemies.
290: MENENIUS: Sham it be put to that?
291: First Senator: The gods forbid!
292: I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
293: Leave us to cure this cause.
294: MENENIUS: For 'tis a sore upon us,
295: You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.
296: COMINIUS: Come, sir, along with us.
297: CORIOLANUS: I would they were barbarians--as they are,
298: Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,
299: Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--
300: MENENIUS: Be gone;
301: Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
302: One time will owe another.
303: CORIOLANUS: On fair ground
304: I could beat forty of them.
305: COMINIUS: I could myself
306: Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the
307: two tribunes:
308: But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;
309: And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands
310: Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
311: Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
312: Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
313: What they are used to bear.
314: MENENIUS: Pray you, be gone:
315: I'll try whether my old wit be in request
316: With those that have but little: this must be patch'd
317: With cloth of any colour.
318: COMINIUS: Nay, come away.
319: A Patrician: This man has marr'd his fortune.
320: MENENIUS: His nature is too noble for the world:
321: He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
322: Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:
323: What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
324: And, being angry, does forget that ever
325: He heard the name of death.
326: Here's goodly work!
327: Second Patrician: I would they were abed!
328: MENENIUS: I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!
329: Could he not speak 'em fair?
330: SICINIUS: Where is this viper
331: That would depopulate the city and
332: Be every man himself?
333: MENENIUS: You worthy tribunes,--
334: SICINIUS: He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
335: With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
336: And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
337: Than the severity of the public power
338: Which he so sets at nought.
339: First Citizen: He shall well know
340: The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
341: And we their hands.
342: Citizens: He shall, sure on't.
343: MENENIUS: Sir, sir,--
344: SICINIUS: Peace!
345: MENENIUS: Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
346: With modest warrant.
347: SICINIUS: Sir, how comes't that you
348: Have holp to make this rescue?
349: MENENIUS: Hear me speak:
350: As I do know the consul's worthiness,
351: So can I name his faults,--
352: SICINIUS: Consul! what consul?
353: MENENIUS: The consul Coriolanus.
354: BRUTUS: He consul!
355: Citizens: No, no, no, no, no.
356: MENENIUS: If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
357: I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
358: The which shall turn you to no further harm
359: Than so much loss of time.
360: SICINIUS: Speak briefly then;
361: For we are peremptory to dispatch
362: This viperous traitor: to eject him hence
363: Were but one danger, and to keep him here
364: Our certain death: therefore it is decreed
365: He dies to-night.
366: MENENIUS: Now the good gods forbid
367: That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
368: Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
369: In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
370: Should now eat up her own!
371: SICINIUS: He's a disease that must be cut away.
372: MENENIUS: O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
373: Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
374: What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
375: Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--
376: Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,
377: By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;
378: And what is left, to lose it by his country,
379: Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,
380: A brand to the end o' the world.
381: SICINIUS: This is clean kam.
382: BRUTUS: Merely awry: when he did love his country,
383: It honour'd him.
384: MENENIUS: The service of the foot
385: Being once gangrened, is not then respected
386: For what before it was.
387: BRUTUS: We'll hear no more.
388: Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
389: Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
390: Spread further.
391: MENENIUS: One word more, one word.
392: This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
393: The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late
394: Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;
395: Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
396: And sack great Rome with Romans.
397: BRUTUS: If it were so,--
398: SICINIUS: What do ye talk?
399: Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
400: Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.
401: MENENIUS: Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars
402: Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
403: In bolted language; meal and bran together
404: He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
405: I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him
406: Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,
407: In peace, to his utmost peril.
408: First Senator: Noble tribunes,
409: It is the humane way: the other course
410: Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
411: Unknown to the beginning.
412: SICINIUS: Noble Menenius,
413: Be you then as the people's officer.
414: Masters, lay down your weapons.
415: BRUTUS: Go not home.
416: SICINIUS: Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:
417: Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
418: In our first way.
419: MENENIUS: I'll bring him to you.
420: Let me desire your company: he must come,
421: Or what is worst will follow.
422: First Senator: Pray you, let's to him.
ACT 3 SCENE 2

1: CORIOLANUS: Let them puff all about mine ears, present me
2: Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
3: Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
4: That the precipitation might down stretch
5: Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
6: Be thus to them.
7: A Patrician: You do the nobler.
8: CORIOLANUS: I muse my mother
9: Does not approve me further, who was wont
10: To call them woollen vassals, things created
11: To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads
12: In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,
13: When one but of my ordinance stood up
14: To speak of peace or war.
15: I talk of you:
16: Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
17: False to my nature? Rather say I play
18: The man I am.
19: VOLUMNIA: O, sir, sir, sir,
20: I would have had you put your power well on,
21: Before you had worn it out.
22: CORIOLANUS: Let go.
23: VOLUMNIA: You might have been enough the man you are,
24: With striving less to be so; lesser had been
25: The thwartings of your dispositions, if
26: You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
27: Ere they lack'd power to cross you.
28: CORIOLANUS: Let them hang.
29: A Patrician: Ay, and burn too.
30: MENENIUS: Come, come, you have been too rough, something
31: too rough;
32: You must return and mend it.
33: First Senator: There's no remedy;
34: Unless, by not so doing, our good city
35: Cleave in the midst, and perish.
36: VOLUMNIA: Pray, be counsell'd:
37: I have a heart as little apt as yours,
38: But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
39: To better vantage.
40: MENENIUS: Well said, noble woman?
41: Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that
42: The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
43: For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
44: Which I can scarcely bear.
45: CORIOLANUS: What must I do?
46: MENENIUS: Return to the tribunes.
47: CORIOLANUS: Well, what then? what then?
48: MENENIUS: Repent what you have spoke.
49: CORIOLANUS: For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
50: Must I then do't to them?
51: VOLUMNIA: You are too absolute;
52: Though therein you can never be too noble,
53: But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,
54: Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
55: I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,
56: In peace what each of them by the other lose,
57: That they combine not there.
58: CORIOLANUS: Tush, tush!
59: MENENIUS: A good demand.
60: VOLUMNIA: If it be honour in your wars to seem
61: The same you are not, which, for your best ends,
62: You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
63: That it shall hold companionship in peace
64: With honour, as in war, since that to both
65: It stands in like request?
66: CORIOLANUS: Why force you this?
67: VOLUMNIA: Because that now it lies you on to speak
68: To the people; not by your own instruction,
69: Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
70: But with such words that are but rooted in
71: Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
72: Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
73: Now, this no more dishonours you at all
74: Than to take in a town with gentle words,
75: Which else would put you to your fortune and
76: The hazard of much blood.
77: I would dissemble with my nature where
78: My fortunes and my friends at stake required
79: I should do so in honour: I am in this,
80: Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
81: And you will rather show our general louts
82: How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
83: For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
84: Of what that want might ruin.
85: MENENIUS: Noble lady!
86: Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,
87: Not what is dangerous present, but the loss
88: Of what is past.
89: VOLUMNIA: I prithee now, my son,
90: Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
91: And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
92: Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
93: Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
94: More learned than the ears--waving thy head,
95: Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
96: Now humble as the ripest mulberry
97: That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
98: Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
99: Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
100: Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
101: In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
102: Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
103: As thou hast power and person.
104: MENENIUS: This but done,
105: Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
106: For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
107: As words to little purpose.
108: VOLUMNIA: Prithee now,
109: Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather
110: Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
111: Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.
112: COMINIUS: I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
113: You make strong party, or defend yourself
114: By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.
115: MENENIUS: Only fair speech.
116: COMINIUS: I think 'twill serve, if he
117: Can thereto frame his spirit.
118: VOLUMNIA: He must, and will
119: Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
120: CORIOLANUS: Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
121: Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
122: A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:
123: Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
124: This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it
125: And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!
126: You have put me now to such a part which never
127: I shall discharge to the life.
128: COMINIUS: Come, come, we'll prompt you.
129: VOLUMNIA: I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
130: My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
131: To have my praise for this, perform a part
132: Thou hast not done before.
133: CORIOLANUS: Well, I must do't:
134: Away, my disposition, and possess me
135: Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,
136: Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
137: Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
138: That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
139: Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
140: The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
141: Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
142: Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
143: That hath received an alms! I will not do't,
144: Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
145: And by my body's action teach my mind
146: A most inherent baseness.
147: VOLUMNIA: At thy choice, then:
148: To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
149: Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let
150: Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
151: Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
152: With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
153: Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
154: But owe thy pride thyself.
155: CORIOLANUS: Pray, be content:
156: Mother, I am going to the market-place;
157: Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
158: Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved
159: Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
160: Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;
161: Or never trust to what my tongue can do
162: I' the way of flattery further.
163: VOLUMNIA: Do your will.
164: COMINIUS: Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
165: To answer mildly; for they are prepared
166: With accusations, as I hear, more strong
167: Than are upon you yet.
168: CORIOLANUS: The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:
169: Let them accuse me by invention, I
170: Will answer in mine honour.
171: MENENIUS: Ay, but mildly.
172: CORIOLANUS: Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!
ACT 3 SCENE 3

1: BRUTUS: In this point charge him home, that he affects
2: Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,
3: Enforce him with his envy to the people,
4: And that the spoil got on the Antiates
5: Was ne'er distributed.
6: What, will he come?
7: AEdile: He's coming.
8: BRUTUS: How accompanied?
9: AEdile: With old Menenius, and those senators
10: That always favour'd him.
11: SICINIUS: Have you a catalogue
12: Of all the voices that we have procured
13: Set down by the poll?
14: AEdile: I have; 'tis ready.
15: SICINIUS: Have you collected them by tribes?
16: AEdile: I have.
17: SICINIUS: Assemble presently the people hither;
18: And when they bear me say 'It shall be so
19: I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either
20: For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them
21: If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
22: Insisting on the old prerogative
23: And power i' the truth o' the cause.
24: AEdile: I shall inform them.
25: BRUTUS: And when such time they have begun to cry,
26: Let them not cease, but with a din confused
27: Enforce the present execution
28: Of what we chance to sentence.
29: AEdile: Very well.
30: SICINIUS: Make them be strong and ready for this hint,
31: When we shall hap to give 't them.
32: BRUTUS: Go about it.
33: Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
34: Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
35: Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot
36: Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks
37: What's in his heart; and that is there which looks
38: With us to break his neck.
39: SICINIUS: Well, here he comes.
40: MENENIUS: Calmly, I do beseech you.
41: CORIOLANUS: Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece
42: Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods
43: Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice
44: Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!
45: Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
46: And not our streets with war!
47: First Senator: Amen, amen.
48: MENENIUS: A noble wish.
49: SICINIUS: Draw near, ye people.
50: AEdile: List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!
51: CORIOLANUS: First, hear me speak.
52: Both Tribunes: Well, say. Peace, ho!
53: CORIOLANUS: Shall I be charged no further than this present?
54: Must all determine here?
55: SICINIUS: I do demand,
56: If you submit you to the people's voices,
57: Allow their officers and are content
58: To suffer lawful censure for such faults
59: As shall be proved upon you?
60: CORIOLANUS: I am content.
61: MENENIUS: Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
62: The warlike service he has done, consider; think
63: Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
64: Like graves i' the holy churchyard.
65: CORIOLANUS: Scratches with briers,
66: Scars to move laughter only.
67: MENENIUS: Consider further,
68: That when he speaks not like a citizen,
69: You find him like a soldier: do not take
70: His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
71: But, as I say, such as become a soldier,
72: Rather than envy you.
73: COMINIUS: Well, well, no more.
74: CORIOLANUS: What is the matter
75: That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
76: I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
77: You take it off again?
78: SICINIUS: Answer to us.
79: CORIOLANUS: Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.
80: SICINIUS: We charge you, that you have contrived to take
81: From Rome all season'd office and to wind
82: Yourself into a power tyrannical;
83: For which you are a traitor to the people.
84: CORIOLANUS: How! traitor!
85: MENENIUS: Nay, temperately; your promise.
86: CORIOLANUS: The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
87: Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
88: Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,
89: In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in
90: Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
91: 'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
92: As I do pray the gods.
93: SICINIUS: Mark you this, people?
94: Citizens: To the rock, to the rock with him!
95: SICINIUS: Peace!
96: We need not put new matter to his charge:
97: What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
98: Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
99: Opposing laws with strokes and here defying
100: Those whose great power must try him; even this,
101: So criminal and in such capital kind,
102: Deserves the extremest death.
103: BRUTUS: But since he hath
104: Served well for Rome,--
105: CORIOLANUS: What do you prate of service?
106: BRUTUS: I talk of that, that know it.
107: CORIOLANUS: You?
108: MENENIUS: Is this the promise that you made your mother?
109: COMINIUS: Know, I pray you,--
110: CORIOLANUS: I know no further:
111: Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
112: Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger
113: But with a grain a day, I would not buy
114: Their mercy at the price of one fair word;
115: Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,
116: To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'
117: SICINIUS: For that he has,
118: As much as in him lies, from time to time
119: Envied against the people, seeking means
120: To pluck away their power, as now at last
121: Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
122: Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
123: That do distribute it; in the name o' the people
124: And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
125: Even from this instant, banish him our city,
126: In peril of precipitation
127: From off the rock Tarpeian never more
128: To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,
129: I say it shall be so.
130: Citizens: It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:
131: He's banish'd, and it shall be so.
132: COMINIUS: Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--
133: SICINIUS: He's sentenced; no more hearing.
134: COMINIUS: Let me speak:
135: I have been consul, and can show for Rome
136: Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
137: My country's good with a respect more tender,
138: More holy and profound, than mine own life,
139: My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
140: And treasure of my loins; then if I would
141: Speak that,--
142: SICINIUS: We know your drift: speak what?
143: BRUTUS: There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
144: As enemy to the people and his country:
145: It shall be so.
146: Citizens: It shall be so, it shall be so.
147: CORIOLANUS: You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
148: As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize
149: As the dead carcasses of unburied men
150: That do corrupt my air, I banish you;
151: And here remain with your uncertainty!
152: Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
153: Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
154: Fan you into despair! Have the power still
155: To banish your defenders; till at length
156: Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
157: Making not reservation of yourselves,
158: Still your own foes, deliver you as most
159: Abated captives to some nation
160: That won you without blows! Despising,
161: For you, the city, thus I turn my back:
162: There is a world elsewhere.
163: AEdile: The people's enemy is gone, is gone!
164: Citizens: Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!
165: SICINIUS: Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,
166: As he hath followed you, with all despite;
167: Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard
168: Attend us through the city.
ACT 4 SCENE 1

1: CORIOLANUS: Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
2: With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
3: Where is your ancient courage? you were used
4: To say extremity was the trier of spirits;
5: That common chances common men could bear;
6: That when the sea was calm all boats alike
7: Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
8: When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves
9: A noble cunning: you were used to load me
10: With precepts that would make invincible
11: The heart that conn'd them.
12: VIRGILIA: O heavens! O heavens!
13: CORIOLANUS: Nay! prithee, woman,--
14: VOLUMNIA: Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
15: And occupations perish!
16: CORIOLANUS: What, what, what!
17: I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.
18: Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
19: If you had been the wife of Hercules,
20: Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved
21: Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
22: Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:
23: I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
24: Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
25: And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
26: I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld
27: Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women
28: 'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
29: As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well
30: My hazards still have been your solace: and
31: Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,
32: Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
33: Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son
34: Will or exceed the common or be caught
35: With cautelous baits and practise.
36: VOLUMNIA: My first son.
37: Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
38: With thee awhile: determine on some course,
39: More than a wild exposture to each chance
40: That starts i' the way before thee.
41: CORIOLANUS: O the gods!
42: COMINIUS: I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee
43: Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us
44: And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth
45: A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
46: O'er the vast world to seek a single man,
47: And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
48: I' the absence of the needer.
49: CORIOLANUS: Fare ye well:
50: Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full
51: Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one
52: That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
53: Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
54: My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
55: Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.
56: While I remain above the ground, you shall
57: Hear from me still, and never of me aught
58: But what is like me formerly.
59: MENENIUS: That's worthily
60: As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.
61: If I could shake off but one seven years
62: From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,
63: I'ld with thee every foot.
64: CORIOLANUS: Give me thy hand: Come.
ACT 4 SCENE 2

1: SICINIUS: Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.
2: The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
3: In his behalf.
4: BRUTUS: Now we have shown our power,
5: Let us seem humbler after it is done
6: Than when it was a-doing.
7: SICINIUS: Bid them home:
8: Say their great enemy is gone, and they
9: Stand in their ancient strength.
10: BRUTUS: Dismiss them home.
11: Here comes his mother.
12: SICINIUS: Let's not meet her.
13: BRUTUS: Why?
14: SICINIUS: They say she's mad.
15: BRUTUS: They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.
16: VOLUMNIA: O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods
17: Requite your love!
18: MENENIUS: Peace, peace; be not so loud.
19: VOLUMNIA: If that I could for weeping, you should hear,--
20: Nay, and you shall hear some.
21: Will you be gone?
22: VIRGILIA: [To SICINIUS] You shall stay too: I would I had the power
23: To say so to my husband.
24: SICINIUS: Are you mankind?
25: VOLUMNIA: Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.
26: Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
27: To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
28: Than thou hast spoken words?
29: SICINIUS: O blessed heavens!
30: VOLUMNIA: More noble blows than ever thou wise words;
31: And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:
32: Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son
33: Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
34: His good sword in his hand.
35: SICINIUS: What then?
36: VIRGILIA: What then!
37: He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
38: VOLUMNIA: Bastards and all.
39: Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!
40: MENENIUS: Come, come, peace.
41: SICINIUS: I would he had continued to his country
42: As he began, and not unknit himself
43: The noble knot he made.
44: BRUTUS: I would he had.
45: VOLUMNIA: 'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:
46: Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
47: As I can of those mysteries which heaven
48: Will not have earth to know.
49: BRUTUS: Pray, let us go.
50: VOLUMNIA: Now, pray, sir, get you gone:
51: You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--
52: As far as doth the Capitol exceed
53: The meanest house in Rome, so far my son--
54: This lady's husband here, this, do you see--
55: Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.
56: BRUTUS: Well, well, we'll leave you.
57: SICINIUS: Why stay we to be baited
58: With one that wants her wits?
59: VOLUMNIA: Take my prayers with you.
60: I would the gods had nothing else to do
61: But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em
62: But once a-day, it would unclog my heart
63: Of what lies heavy to't.
64: MENENIUS: You have told them home;
65: And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?
66: VOLUMNIA: Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,
67: And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:
68: Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
69: In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.
70: MENENIUS: Fie, fie, fie!
ACT 4 SCENE 3

1: Roman: I know you well, sir, and you know
2: me: your name, I think, is Adrian.
3: Volsce: It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.
4: Roman: I am a Roman; and my services are,
5: as you are, against 'em: know you me yet?
6: Volsce: Nicanor? no.
7: Roman: The same, sir.
8: Volsce: You had more beard when I last saw you; but your
9: favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the
10: news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,
11: to find you out there: you have well saved me a
12: day's journey.
13: Roman: There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the
14: people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.
15: Volsce: Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not
16: so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and
17: hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.
18: Roman: The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing
19: would make it flame again: for the nobles receive
20: so to heart the banishment of that worthy
21: Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take
22: all power from the people and to pluck from them
23: their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can
24: tell you, and is almost mature for the violent
25: breaking out.
26: Volsce: Coriolanus banished!
27: Roman: Banished, sir.
28: Volsce: You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.
29: Roman: The day serves well for them now. I have heard it
30: said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is
31: when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble
32: Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his
33: great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request
34: of his country.
35: Volsce: He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus
36: accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my
37: business, and I will merrily accompany you home.
38: Roman: I shall, between this and supper, tell you most
39: strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of
40: their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?
41: Volsce: A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,
42: distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,
43: and to be on foot at an hour's warning.
44: Roman: I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the
45: man, I think, that shall set them in present action.
46: So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.
47: Volsce: You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause
48: to be glad of yours.
49: Roman: Well, let us go together.
ACT 4 SCENE 4

1: CORIOLANUS: A goodly city is this Antium. City,
2: 'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
3: Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
4: Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,
5: Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
6: In puny battle slay me.
7: Save you, sir.
8: Citizen: And you.
9: CORIOLANUS: Direct me, if it be your will,
10: Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?
11: Citizen: He is, and feasts the nobles of the state
12: At his house this night.
13: CORIOLANUS: Which is his house, beseech you?
14: Citizen: This, here before you.
15: CORIOLANUS: Thank you, sir: farewell.
16: O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,
17: Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,
18: Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
19: Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love
20: Unseparable, shall within this hour,
21: On a dissension of a doit, break out
22: To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
23: Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,
24: To take the one the other, by some chance,
25: Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
26: And interjoin their issues. So with me:
27: My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
28: This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,
29: He does fair justice; if he give me way,
30: I'll do his country service.
ACT 4 SCENE 5

1: First Servingman: Wine, wine, wine! What service
2: is here! I think our fellows are asleep.
3: Second Servingman: Where's Cotus? my master calls
4: for him. Cotus!
5: CORIOLANUS: A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I
6: Appear not like a guest.
7: First Servingman: What would you have, friend? whence are you?
8: Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door.
9: CORIOLANUS: I have deserved no better entertainment,
10: In being Coriolanus.
11: Second Servingman: Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his
12: head; that he gives entrance to such companions?
13: Pray, get you out.
14: CORIOLANUS: Away!
15: Second Servingman: Away! get you away.
16: CORIOLANUS: Now thou'rt troublesome.
17: Second Servingman: Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.
18: Third Servingman: What fellow's this?
19: First Servingman: A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him
20: out of the house: prithee, call my master to him.
21: Third Servingman: What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid
22: the house.
23: CORIOLANUS: Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.
24: Third Servingman: What are you?
25: CORIOLANUS: A gentleman.
26: Third Servingman: A marvellous poor one.
27: CORIOLANUS: True, so I am.
28: Third Servingman: Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other
29: station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.
30: CORIOLANUS: Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.
31: Third Servingman: What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a
32: strange guest he has here.
33: Second Servingman: And I shall.
34: Third Servingman: Where dwellest thou?
35: CORIOLANUS: Under the canopy.
36: Third Servingman: Under the canopy!
37: CORIOLANUS: Ay.
38: Third Servingman: Where's that?
39: CORIOLANUS: I' the city of kites and crows.
40: Third Servingman: I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!
41: Then thou dwellest with daws too?
42: CORIOLANUS: No, I serve not thy master.
43: Third Servingman: How, sir! do you meddle with my master?
44: CORIOLANUS: Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
45: mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy
46: trencher, hence!
47: AUFIDIUS: Where is this fellow?
48: Second Servingman: Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for
49: disturbing the lords within.
50: AUFIDIUS: Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
51: Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?
52: CORIOLANUS: If, Tullus,
53: Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not
54: Think me for the man I am, necessity
55: Commands me name myself.
56: AUFIDIUS: What is thy name?
57: CORIOLANUS: A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
58: And harsh in sound to thine.
59: AUFIDIUS: Say, what's thy name?
60: Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
61: Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.
62: Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?
63: CORIOLANUS: Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st
64: thou me yet?
65: AUFIDIUS: I know thee not: thy name?
66: CORIOLANUS: My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
67: To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
68: Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
69: My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
70: The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
71: Shed for my thankless country are requited
72: But with that surname; a good memory,
73: And witness of the malice and displeasure
74: Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;
75: The cruelty and envy of the people,
76: Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
77: Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
78: And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
79: Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
80: Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--
81: Mistake me not--to save my life, for if
82: I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
83: I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
84: To be full quit of those my banishers,
85: Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
86: A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
87: Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
88: Of shame seen through thy country, speed
89: thee straight,
90: And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
91: That my revengeful services may prove
92: As benefits to thee, for I will fight
93: Against my canker'd country with the spleen
94: Of all the under fiends. But if so be
95: Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
96: Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am
97: Longer to live most weary, and present
98: My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
99: Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
100: Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
101: Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
102: And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
103: It be to do thee service.
104: AUFIDIUS: O Marcius, Marcius!
105: Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
106: A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
107: Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
108: And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more
109: Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
110: Mine arms about that body, where against
111: My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
112: And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
113: The anvil of my sword, and do contest
114: As hotly and as nobly with thy love
115: As ever in ambitious strength I did
116: Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
117: I loved the maid I married; never man
118: Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
119: Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
120: Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
121: Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
122: We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
123: Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
124: Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
125: Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
126: Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
127: We have been down together in my sleep,
128: Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
129: And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
130: Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
131: Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
132: From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
133: Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
134: Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
135: And take our friendly senators by the hands;
136: Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
137: Who am prepared against your territories,
138: Though not for Rome itself.
139: CORIOLANUS: You bless me, gods!
140: AUFIDIUS: Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have
141: The leading of thine own revenges, take
142: The one half of my commission; and set down--
143: As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st
144: Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;
145: Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
146: Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
147: To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:
148: Let me commend thee first to those that shall
149: Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
150: And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
151: Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!
152: First Servingman: Here's a strange alteration!
153: Second Servingman: By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
154: a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
155: false report of him.
156: First Servingman: What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
157: finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.
158: Second Servingman: Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
159: him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I
160: cannot tell how to term it.
161: First Servingman: He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,
162: but I thought there was more in him than I could think.
163: Second Servingman: So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest
164: man i' the world.
165: First Servingman: I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.
166: Second Servingman: Who, my master?
167: First Servingman: Nay, it's no matter for that.
168: Second Servingman: Worth six on him.
169: First Servingman: Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the
170: greater soldier.
171: Second Servingman: Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:
172: for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.
173: First Servingman: Ay, and for an assault too.
174: Third Servingman: O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!
175: Second Servingman: What, what, what? let's partake.
176: Third Servingman: I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as
177: lieve be a condemned man.
178: Second Servingman: Wherefore? wherefore?
179: Third Servingman: Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,
180: Caius Marcius.
181: First Servingman: Why do you say 'thwack our general '?
182: Third Servingman: I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always
183: good enough for him.
184: Second Servingman: Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too
185: hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.
186: First Servingman: He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
187: on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
188: him like a carbon ado.
189: Second Servingman: An he had been cannibally given, he might have
190: broiled and eaten him too.
191: First Servingman: But, more of thy news?
192: Third Servingman: Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son
193: and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no
194: question asked him by any of the senators, but they
195: stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
196: mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and
197: turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But
198: the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'
199: the middle and but one half of what he was
200: yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty
201: and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
202: and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he
203: will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.
204: Second Servingman: And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.
205: Third Servingman: Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as
206: many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it
207: were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
208: we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.
209: First Servingman: Directitude! what's that?
210: Third Servingman: But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,
211: and the man in blood, they will out of their
212: burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with
213: him.
214: First Servingman: But when goes this forward?
215: Third Servingman: To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the
216: drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a
217: parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they
218: wipe their lips.
219: Second Servingman: Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
220: This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase
221: tailors, and breed ballad-makers.
222: First Servingman: Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
223: day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and
224: full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;
225: mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more
226: bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.
227: Second Servingman: 'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to
228: be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a
229: great maker of cuckolds.
230: First Servingman: Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
231: Third Servingman: Reason; because they then less need one another.
232: The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
233: as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.
234: All: In, in, in, in!
ACT 4 SCENE 6

1: SICINIUS: We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
2: His remedies are tame i' the present peace
3: And quietness of the people, which before
4: Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
5: Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
6: Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
7: Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
8: Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
9: About their functions friendly.
10: BRUTUS: We stood to't in good time.
11: Is this Menenius?
12: SICINIUS: 'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.
13: Both Tribunes: Hail sir!
14: MENENIUS: Hail to you both!
15: SICINIUS: Your Coriolanus
16: Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:
17: The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,
18: Were he more angry at it.
19: MENENIUS: All's well; and might have been much better, if
20: He could have temporized.
21: SICINIUS: Where is he, hear you?
22: MENENIUS: Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife
23: Hear nothing from him.
24: Citizens: The gods preserve you both!
25: SICINIUS: God-den, our neighbours.
26: BRUTUS: God-den to you all, god-den to you all.
27: First Citizen: Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,
28: Are bound to pray for you both.
29: SICINIUS: Live, and thrive!
30: BRUTUS: Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus
31: Had loved you as we did.
32: Citizens: Now the gods keep you!
33: Both Tribunes: Farewell, farewell.
34: SICINIUS: This is a happier and more comely time
35: Than when these fellows ran about the streets,
36: Crying confusion.
37: BRUTUS: Caius Marcius was
38: A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,
39: O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
40: Self-loving,--
41: SICINIUS: And affecting one sole throne,
42: Without assistance.
43: MENENIUS: I think not so.
44: SICINIUS: We should by this, to all our lamentation,
45: If he had gone forth consul, found it so.
46: BRUTUS: The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
47: Sits safe and still without him.
48: AEdile: Worthy tribunes,
49: There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
50: Reports, the Volsces with two several powers
51: Are enter'd in the Roman territories,
52: And with the deepest malice of the war
53: Destroy what lies before 'em.
54: MENENIUS: 'Tis Aufidius,
55: Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
56: Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;
57: Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
58: And durst not once peep out.
59: SICINIUS: Come, what talk you
60: Of Marcius?
61: BRUTUS: Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
62: The Volsces dare break with us.
63: MENENIUS: Cannot be!
64: We have record that very well it can,
65: And three examples of the like have been
66: Within my age. But reason with the fellow,
67: Before you punish him, where he heard this,
68: Lest you shall chance to whip your information
69: And beat the messenger who bids beware
70: Of what is to be dreaded.
71: SICINIUS: Tell not me:
72: I know this cannot be.
73: BRUTUS: Not possible.
74: Messenger: The nobles in great earnestness are going
75: All to the senate-house: some news is come
76: That turns their countenances.
77: SICINIUS: 'Tis this slave;--
78: Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;
79: Nothing but his report.
80: Messenger: Yes, worthy sir,
81: The slave's report is seconded; and more,
82: More fearful, is deliver'd.
83: SICINIUS: What more fearful?
84: Messenger: It is spoke freely out of many mouths--
85: How probable I do not know--that Marcius,
86: Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
87: And vows revenge as spacious as between
88: The young'st and oldest thing.
89: SICINIUS: This is most likely!
90: BRUTUS: Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
91: Good Marcius home again.
92: SICINIUS: The very trick on't.
93: MENENIUS: This is unlikely:
94: He and Aufidius can no more atone
95: Than violentest contrariety.
96: Second Messenger: You are sent for to the senate:
97: A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
98: Associated with Aufidius, rages
99: Upon our territories; and have already
100: O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took
101: What lay before them.
102: COMINIUS: O, you have made good work!
103: MENENIUS: What news? what news?
104: COMINIUS: You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
105: To melt the city leads upon your pates,
106: To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--
107: MENENIUS: What's the news? what's the news?
108: COMINIUS: Your temples burned in their cement, and
109: Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
110: Into an auger's bore.
111: MENENIUS: Pray now, your news?
112: You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--
113: If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--
114: COMINIUS: If!
115: He is their god: he leads them like a thing
116: Made by some other deity than nature,
117: That shapes man better; and they follow him,
118: Against us brats, with no less confidence
119: Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
120: Or butchers killing flies.
121: MENENIUS: You have made good work,
122: You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much
123: on the voice of occupation and
124: The breath of garlic-eaters!
125: COMINIUS: He will shake
126: Your Rome about your ears.
127: MENENIUS: As Hercules
128: Did shake down mellow fruit.
129: You have made fair work!
130: BRUTUS: But is this true, sir?
131: COMINIUS: Ay; and you'll look pale
132: Before you find it other. All the regions
133: Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
134: Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
135: And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
136: Your enemies and his find something in him.
137: MENENIUS: We are all undone, unless
138: The noble man have mercy.
139: COMINIUS: Who shall ask it?
140: The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
141: Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
142: Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they
143: Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
144: As those should do that had deserved his hate,
145: And therein show'd like enemies.
146: MENENIUS: 'Tis true:
147: If he were putting to my house the brand
148: That should consume it, I have not the face
149: To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,
150: You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!
151: COMINIUS: You have brought
152: A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
153: So incapable of help.
154: Both Tribunes: Say not we brought it.
155: MENENIUS: How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts
156: And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
157: Who did hoot him out o' the city.
158: COMINIUS: But I fear
159: They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
160: The second name of men, obeys his points
161: As if he were his officer: desperation
162: Is all the policy, strength and defence,
163: That Rome can make against them.
164: MENENIUS: Here come the clusters.
165: And is Aufidius with him? You are they
166: That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
167: Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
168: Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
169: And not a hair upon a soldier's head
170: Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
171: As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
172: And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
173: if he could burn us all into one coal,
174: We have deserved it.
175: Citizens: Faith, we hear fearful news.
176: First Citizen: For mine own part,
177: When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.
178: Second Citizen: And so did I.
179: Third Citizen: And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very
180: many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and
181: though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet
182: it was against our will.
183: COMINIUS: Ye re goodly things, you voices!
184: MENENIUS: You have made
185: Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?
186: COMINIUS: O, ay, what else?
187: SICINIUS: Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:
188: These are a side that would be glad to have
189: This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
190: And show no sign of fear.
191: First Citizen: The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.
192: I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished
193: him.
194: Second Citizen: So did we all. But, come, let's home.
195: BRUTUS: I do not like this news.
196: SICINIUS: Nor I.
197: BRUTUS: Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
198: Would buy this for a lie!
199: SICINIUS: Pray, let us go.
ACT 4 SCENE 7

1: AUFIDIUS: Do they still fly to the Roman?
2: Lieutenant: I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
3: Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
4: Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
5: And you are darken'd in this action, sir,
6: Even by your own.
7: AUFIDIUS: I cannot help it now,
8: Unless, by using means, I lame the foot
9: Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
10: Even to my person, than I thought he would
11: When first I did embrace him: yet his nature
12: In that's no changeling; and I must excuse
13: What cannot be amended.
14: Lieutenant: Yet I wish, sir,--
15: I mean for your particular,--you had not
16: Join'd in commission with him; but either
17: Had borne the action of yourself, or else
18: To him had left it solely.
19: AUFIDIUS: I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
20: when he shall come to his account, he knows not
21: What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
22: And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
23: To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.
24: And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
25: Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
26: As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
27: That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
28: Whene'er we come to our account.
29: Lieutenant: Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
ACT 5 SCENE 1

1: MENENIUS: No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said
2: Which was sometime his general; who loved him
3: In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:
4: But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;
5: A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
6: The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd
7: To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.
8: COMINIUS: He would not seem to know me.
9: MENENIUS: Do you hear?
10: COMINIUS: Yet one time he did call me by my name:
11: I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops
12: That we have bled together. Coriolanus
13: He would not answer to: forbad all names;
14: He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
15: Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire
16: Of burning Rome.
17: MENENIUS: Why, so: you have made good work!
18: A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,
19: To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!
20: COMINIUS: I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
21: When it was less expected: he replied,
22: It was a bare petition of a state
23: To one whom they had punish'd.
24: MENENIUS: Very well:
25: Could he say less?
26: COMINIUS: I offer'd to awaken his regard
27: For's private friends: his answer to me was,
28: He could not stay to pick them in a pile
29: Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
30: For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
31: And still to nose the offence.
32: MENENIUS: For one poor grain or two!
33: I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,
34: And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:
35: You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt
36: Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.
37: SICINIUS: Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid
38: In this so never-needed help, yet do not
39: Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you
40: Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
41: More than the instant army we can make,
42: Might stop our countryman.
43: MENENIUS: No, I'll not meddle.
44: SICINIUS: Pray you, go to him.
45: MENENIUS: What should I do?
46: BRUTUS: Only make trial what your love can do
47: For Rome, towards Marcius.
48: MENENIUS: Well, and say that Marcius
49: Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
50: Unheard; what then?
51: But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
52: With his unkindness? say't be so?
53: SICINIUS: Yet your good will
54: must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure
55: As you intended well.
56: MENENIUS: I'll undertake 't:
57: I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
58: And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.
59: He was not taken well; he had not dined:
60: The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
61: We pout upon the morning, are unapt
62: To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
63: These and these conveyances of our blood
64: With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
65: Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him
66: Till he be dieted to my request,
67: And then I'll set upon him.
68: BRUTUS: You know the very road into his kindness,
69: And cannot lose your way.
70: MENENIUS: Good faith, I'll prove him,
71: Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
72: Of my success.
73: COMINIUS: He'll never hear him.
74: SICINIUS: Not?
75: COMINIUS: I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
76: Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury
77: The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
78: 'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
79: Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,
80: He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
81: Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:
82: So that all hope is vain.
83: Unless his noble mother, and his wife;
84: Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him
85: For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,
86: And with our fair entreaties haste them on.
ACT 5 SCENE 2

1: First Senator: Stay: whence are you?
2: Second Senator: Stand, and go back.
3: MENENIUS: You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,
4: I am an officer of state, and come
5: To speak with Coriolanus.
6: First Senator: From whence?
7: MENENIUS: From Rome.
8: First Senator: You may not pass, you must return: our general
9: Will no more hear from thence.
10: Second Senator: You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before
11: You'll speak with Coriolanus.
12: MENENIUS: Good my friends,
13: If you have heard your general talk of Rome,
14: And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
15: My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.
16: First Senator: Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name
17: Is not here passable.
18: MENENIUS: I tell thee, fellow,
19: The general is my lover: I have been
20: The book of his good acts, whence men have read
21: His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;
22: For I have ever verified my friends,
23: Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity
24: Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
25: Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
26: I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise
27: Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,
28: I must have leave to pass.
29: First Senator: Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his
30: behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you
31: should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous
32: to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.
33: MENENIUS: Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,
34: always factionary on the party of your general.
35: Second Senator: Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
36: have, I am one that, telling true under him, must
37: say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.
38: MENENIUS: Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not
39: speak with him till after dinner.
40: First Senator: You are a Roman, are you?
41: MENENIUS: I am, as thy general is.
42: First Senator: Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,
43: when you have pushed out your gates the very
44: defender of them, and, in a violent popular
45: ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to
46: front his revenges with the easy groans of old
47: women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with
48: the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
49: you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the
50: intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with
51: such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;
52: therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your
53: execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn
54: you out of reprieve and pardon.
55: MENENIUS: Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would
56: use me with estimation.
57: Second Senator: Come, my captain knows you not.
58: MENENIUS: I mean, thy general.
59: First Senator: My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest
60: I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's
61: the utmost of your having: back.
62: MENENIUS: Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--
63: CORIOLANUS: What's the matter?
64: MENENIUS: Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:
65: You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall
66: perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
67: my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment
68: with him, if thou standest not i' the state of
69: hanging, or of some death more long in
70: spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now
71: presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.
72: The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
73: particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than
74: thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!
75: thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's
76: water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to
77: thee; but being assured none but myself could move
78: thee, I have been blown out of your gates with
79: sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy
80: petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy
81: wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet
82: here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my
83: access to thee.
84: CORIOLANUS: Away!
85: MENENIUS: How! away!
86: CORIOLANUS: Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
87: Are servanted to others: though I owe
88: My revenge properly, my remission lies
89: In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
90: Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather
91: Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.
92: Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
93: Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,
94: Take this along; I writ it for thy sake
95: And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,
96: I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,
97: Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!
98: AUFIDIUS: You keep a constant temper.
99: First Senator: Now, sir, is your name Menenius?
100: Second Senator: 'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the
101: way home again.
102: First Senator: Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
103: greatness back?
104: Second Senator: What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?
105: MENENIUS: I neither care for the world nor your general: for
106: such things as you, I can scarce think there's any,
107: ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by
108: himself fears it not from another: let your general
109: do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and
110: your misery increase with your age! I say to you,
111: as I was said to, Away!
112: First Senator: A noble fellow, I warrant him.
113: Second Senator: The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the
114: oak not to be wind-shaken.
ACT 5 SCENE 3

1: CORIOLANUS: We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow
2: Set down our host. My partner in this action,
3: You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly
4: I have borne this business.
5: AUFIDIUS: Only their ends
6: You have respected; stopp'd your ears against
7: The general suit of Rome; never admitted
8: A private whisper, no, not with such friends
9: That thought them sure of you.
10: CORIOLANUS: This last old man,
11: Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
12: Loved me above the measure of a father;
13: Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
14: Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
15: Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd
16: The first conditions, which they did refuse
17: And cannot now accept; to grace him only
18: That thought he could do more, a very little
19: I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,
20: Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
21: Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?
22: Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
23: In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
24: My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould
25: Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand
26: The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!
27: All bond and privilege of nature, break!
28: Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
29: What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
30: Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
31: Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;
32: As if Olympus to a molehill should
33: In supplication nod: and my young boy
34: Hath an aspect of intercession, which
35: Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces
36: Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never
37: Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,
38: As if a man were author of himself
39: And knew no other kin.
40: VIRGILIA: My lord and husband!
41: CORIOLANUS: These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
42: VIRGILIA: The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
43: Makes you think so.
44: CORIOLANUS: Like a dull actor now,
45: I have forgot my part, and I am out,
46: Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
47: Forgive my tyranny; but do not say
48: For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
49: Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
50: Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
51: I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip
52: Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
53: And the most noble mother of the world
54: Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;
55: Of thy deep duty more impression show
56: Than that of common sons.
57: VOLUMNIA: O, stand up blest!
58: Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,
59: I kneel before thee; and unproperly
60: Show duty, as mistaken all this while
61: Between the child and parent.
62: CORIOLANUS: What is this?
63: Your knees to me? to your corrected son?
64: Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
65: Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
66: Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;
67: Murdering impossibility, to make
68: What cannot be, slight work.
69: VOLUMNIA: Thou art my warrior;
70: I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?
71: CORIOLANUS: The noble sister of Publicola,
72: The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
73: That's curdied by the frost from purest snow
74: And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!
75: VOLUMNIA: This is a poor epitome of yours,
76: Which by the interpretation of full time
77: May show like all yourself.
78: CORIOLANUS: The god of soldiers,
79: With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
80: Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove
81: To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars
82: Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
83: And saving those that eye thee!
84: VOLUMNIA: Your knee, sirrah.
85: CORIOLANUS: That's my brave boy!
86: VOLUMNIA: Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
87: Are suitors to you.
88: CORIOLANUS: I beseech you, peace:
89: Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:
90: The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
91: Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
92: Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate
93: Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
94: Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
95: To ally my rages and revenges with
96: Your colder reasons.
97: VOLUMNIA: O, no more, no more!
98: You have said you will not grant us any thing;
99: For we have nothing else to ask, but that
100: Which you deny already: yet we will ask;
101: That, if you fail in our request, the blame
102: May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.
103: CORIOLANUS: Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
104: Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?
105: VOLUMNIA: Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
106: And state of bodies would bewray what life
107: We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
108: How more unfortunate than all living women
109: Are we come hither: since that thy sight,
110: which should
111: Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance
112: with comforts,
113: Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;
114: Making the mother, wife and child to see
115: The son, the husband and the father tearing
116: His country's bowels out. And to poor we
117: Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us
118: Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
119: That all but we enjoy; for how can we,
120: Alas, how can we for our country pray.
121: Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
122: Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose
123: The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
124: Our comfort in the country. We must find
125: An evident calamity, though we had
126: Our wish, which side should win: for either thou
127: Must, as a foreign recreant, be led
128: With manacles thorough our streets, or else
129: triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
130: And bear the palm for having bravely shed
131: Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,
132: I purpose not to wait on fortune till
133: These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
134: Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
135: Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner
136: March to assault thy country than to tread--
137: Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,
138: That brought thee to this world.
139: VIRGILIA: Ay, and mine,
140: That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name
141: Living to time.
142: Young MARCIUS: A' shall not tread on me;
143: I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.
144: CORIOLANUS: Not of a woman's tenderness to be,
145: Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
146: I have sat too long.
147: VOLUMNIA: Nay, go not from us thus.
148: If it were so that our request did tend
149: To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
150: The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
151: As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit
152: Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
153: May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,
154: 'This we received;' and each in either side
155: Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest
156: For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
157: The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,
158: That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
159: Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,
160: Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
161: Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
162: But with his last attempt he wiped it out;
163: Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
164: To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:
165: Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
166: To imitate the graces of the gods;
167: To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,
168: And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
169: That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
170: Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
171: Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
172: He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
173: Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
174: Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
175: More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate
176: Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
177: Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,
178: When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
179: Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,
180: Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
181: And spurn me back: but if it be not so,
182: Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,
183: That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
184: To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
185: Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
186: To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
187: Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
188: This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
189: And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:
190: This boy, that cannot tell what he would have
191: But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,
192: Does reason our petition with more strength
193: Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:
194: This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
195: His wife is in Corioli and his child
196: Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:
197: I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,
198: And then I'll speak a little.
199: CORIOLANUS: O mother, mother!
200: What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
201: The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
202: They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
203: You have won a happy victory to Rome;
204: But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,
205: Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
206: If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.
207: Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
208: I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
209: Were you in my stead, would you have heard
210: A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?
211: AUFIDIUS: I was moved withal.
212: CORIOLANUS: I dare be sworn you were:
213: And, sir, it is no little thing to make
214: Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
215: What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,
216: I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,
217: Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!
218: AUFIDIUS: [Aside] I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and
219: thy honour
220: At difference in thee: out of that I'll work
221: Myself a former fortune.
222: CORIOLANUS: Ay, by and by;
223: But we will drink together; and you shall bear
224: A better witness back than words, which we,
225: On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
226: Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
227: To have a temple built you: all the swords
228: In Italy, and her confederate arms,
229: Could not have made this peace.
ACT 5 SCENE 4

1: MENENIUS: See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond
2: corner-stone?
3: SICINIUS: Why, what of that?
4: MENENIUS: If it be possible for you to displace it with your
5: little finger, there is some hope the ladies of
6: Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.
7: But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are
8: sentenced and stay upon execution.
9: SICINIUS: Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
10: condition of a man!
11: MENENIUS: There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;
12: yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown
13: from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a
14: creeping thing.
15: SICINIUS: He loved his mother dearly.
16: MENENIUS: So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother
17: now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness
18: of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he
19: moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before
20: his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with
21: his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a
22: battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for
23: Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with
24: his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity
25: and a heaven to throne in.
26: SICINIUS: Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.
27: MENENIUS: I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his
28: mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy
29: in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that
30: shall our poor city find: and all this is long of
31: you.
32: SICINIUS: The gods be good unto us!
33: MENENIUS: No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto
34: us. When we banished him, we respected not them;
35: and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.
36: Messenger: Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:
37: The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune
38: And hale him up and down, all swearing, if
39: The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,
40: They'll give him death by inches.
41: SICINIUS: What's the news?
42: Second Messenger: Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,
43: The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:
44: A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
45: No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
46: SICINIUS: Friend,
47: Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?
48: Second Messenger: As certain as I know the sun is fire:
49: Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?
50: Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
51: As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!
52: The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,
53: Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,
54: Make the sun dance. Hark you!
55: MENENIUS: This is good news:
56: I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
57: Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,
58: A city full; of tribunes, such as you,
59: A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
60: This morning for ten thousand of your throats
61: I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!
62: SICINIUS: First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
63: Accept my thankfulness.
64: Second Messenger: Sir, we have all
65: Great cause to give great thanks.
66: SICINIUS: They are near the city?
67: Second Messenger: Almost at point to enter.
68: SICINIUS: We will meet them,
69: And help the joy.
ACT 5 SCENE 5

1: First Senator: Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
2: Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
3: And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:
4: Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,
5: Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;
6: Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'
7: All: Welcome, ladies, Welcome!
ACT 5 SCENE 6

1: AUFIDIUS: Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:
2: Deliver them this paper: having read it,
3: Bid them repair to the market place; where I,
4: Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
5: Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse
6: The city ports by this hath enter'd and
7: Intends to appear before the people, hoping
8: To purge herself with words: dispatch.
9: Most welcome!
10: First Conspirator: How is it with our general?
11: AUFIDIUS: Even so
12: As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
13: And with his charity slain.
14: Second Conspirator: Most noble sir,
15: If you do hold the same intent wherein
16: You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you
17: Of your great danger.
18: AUFIDIUS: Sir, I cannot tell:
19: We must proceed as we do find the people.
20: Third Conspirator: The people will remain uncertain whilst
21: 'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
22: Makes the survivor heir of all.
23: AUFIDIUS: I know it;
24: And my pretext to strike at him admits
25: A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd
26: Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,
27: He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,
28: Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,
29: He bow'd his nature, never known before
30: But to be rough, unswayable and free.
31: Third Conspirator: Sir, his stoutness
32: When he did stand for consul, which he lost
33: By lack of stooping,--
34: AUFIDIUS: That I would have spoke of:
35: Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;
36: Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;
37: Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
38: In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
39: Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
40: My best and freshest men; served his designments
41: In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
42: Which he did end all his; and took some pride
43: To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
44: I seem'd his follower, not partner, and
45: He waged me with his countenance, as if
46: I had been mercenary.
47: First Conspirator: So he did, my lord:
48: The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,
49: When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
50: For no less spoil than glory,--
51: AUFIDIUS: There was it:
52: For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
53: At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
54: As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
55: Of our great action: therefore shall he die,
56: And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!
57: First Conspirator: Your native town you enter'd like a post,
58: And had no welcomes home: but he returns,
59: Splitting the air with noise.
60: Second Conspirator: And patient fools,
61: Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
62: With giving him glory.
63: Third Conspirator: Therefore, at your vantage,
64: Ere he express himself, or move the people
65: With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
66: Which we will second. When he lies along,
67: After your way his tale pronounced shall bury
68: His reasons with his body.
69: AUFIDIUS: Say no more:
70: Here come the lords.
71: All The Lords: You are most welcome home.
72: AUFIDIUS: I have not deserved it.
73: But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
74: What I have written to you?
75: Lords: We have.
76: First Lord: And grieve to hear't.
77: What faults he made before the last, I think
78: Might have found easy fines: but there to end
79: Where he was to begin and give away
80: The benefit of our levies, answering us
81: With our own charge, making a treaty where
82: There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.
83: AUFIDIUS: He approaches: you shall hear him.
84: CORIOLANUS: Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,
85: No more infected with my country's love
86: Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
87: Under your great command. You are to know
88: That prosperously I have attempted and
89: With bloody passage led your wars even to
90: The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
91: Do more than counterpoise a full third part
92: The charges of the action. We have made peace
93: With no less honour to the Antiates
94: Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,
95: Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,
96: Together with the seal o' the senate, what
97: We have compounded on.
98: AUFIDIUS: Read it not, noble lords;
99: But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree
100: He hath abused your powers.
101: CORIOLANUS: Traitor! how now!
102: AUFIDIUS: Ay, traitor, Marcius!
103: CORIOLANUS: Marcius!
104: AUFIDIUS: Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think
105: I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
106: Coriolanus in Corioli?
107: You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously
108: He has betray'd your business, and given up,
109: For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
110: I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;
111: Breaking his oath and resolution like
112: A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
113: Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears
114: He whined and roar'd away your victory,
115: That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
116: Look'd wondering each at other.
117: CORIOLANUS: Hear'st thou, Mars?
118: AUFIDIUS: Name not the god, thou boy of tears!
119: CORIOLANUS: Ha!
120: AUFIDIUS: No more.
121: CORIOLANUS: Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
122: Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
123: Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
124: I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,
125: Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--
126: Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that
127: Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
128: To thrust the lie unto him.
129: First Lord: Peace, both, and hear me speak.
130: CORIOLANUS: Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
131: Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!
132: If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,
133: That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
134: Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
135: Alone I did it. Boy!
136: AUFIDIUS: Why, noble lords,
137: Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
138: Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
139: 'Fore your own eyes and ears?
140: All Conspirators: Let him die for't.
141: All The People: 'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd
142: my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin
143: Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'
144: Second Lord: Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
145: The man is noble and his fame folds-in
146: This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
147: Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
148: And trouble not the peace.
149: CORIOLANUS: O that I had him,
150: With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
151: To use my lawful sword!
152: AUFIDIUS: Insolent villain!
153: All Conspirators: Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!
154: Lords: Hold, hold, hold, hold!
155: AUFIDIUS: My noble masters, hear me speak.
156: First Lord: O Tullus,--
157: Second Lord: Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.
158: Third Lord: Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;
159: Put up your swords.
160: AUFIDIUS: My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,
161: Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger
162: Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
163: That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
164: To call me to your senate, I'll deliver
165: Myself your loyal servant, or endure
166: Your heaviest censure.
167: First Lord: Bear from hence his body;
168: And mourn you for him: let him be regarded
169: As the most noble corse that ever herald
170: Did follow to his urn.
171: Second Lord: His own impatience
172: Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
173: Let's make the best of it.
