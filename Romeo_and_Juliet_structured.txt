ACT 1 SCENE 1

1: SAMPSON: Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
2: GREGORY: No, for then we should be colliers.
3: SAMPSON: I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
4: GREGORY: Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
5: SAMPSON: I strike quickly, being moved.
6: GREGORY: But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
7: SAMPSON: A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
8: GREGORY: To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
9: therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
10: SAMPSON: A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
11: take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
12: GREGORY: That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
13: to the wall.
14: SAMPSON: True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
15: are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
16: Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
17: to the wall.
18: GREGORY: The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
19: SAMPSON: 'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
20: have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
21: maids, and cut off their heads.
22: GREGORY: The heads of the maids?
23: SAMPSON: Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
24: take it in what sense thou wilt.
25: GREGORY: They must take it in sense that feel it.
26: SAMPSON: Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
27: 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
28: GREGORY: 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
29: hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
30: two of the house of the Montagues.
31: SAMPSON: My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
32: GREGORY: How! turn thy back and run?
33: SAMPSON: Fear me not.
34: GREGORY: No, marry; I fear thee!
35: SAMPSON: Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
36: GREGORY: I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
37: they list.
38: SAMPSON: Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
39: which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
40: ABRAHAM: Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
41: SAMPSON: I do bite my thumb, sir.
42: ABRAHAM: Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
43: SAMPSON: [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
44: ay?
45: GREGORY: No.
46: SAMPSON: No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
47: bite my thumb, sir.
48: GREGORY: Do you quarrel, sir?
49: ABRAHAM: Quarrel sir! no, sir.
50: SAMPSON: If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
51: ABRAHAM: No better.
52: SAMPSON: Well, sir.
53: GREGORY: Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
54: SAMPSON: Yes, better, sir.
55: ABRAHAM: You lie.
56: SAMPSON: Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
57: BENVOLIO: Part, fools!
58: Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
59: TYBALT: What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
60: Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
61: BENVOLIO: I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
62: Or manage it to part these men with me.
63: TYBALT: What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
64: As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
65: Have at thee, coward!
66: First Citizen: Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
67: Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
68: CAPULET: What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
69: LADY CAPULET: A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
70: CAPULET: My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
71: And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
72: MONTAGUE: Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
73: LADY MONTAGUE: Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
74: PRINCE: Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
75: Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
76: Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
77: That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
78: With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
79: On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
80: Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
81: And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
82: Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
83: By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
84: Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
85: And made Verona's ancient citizens
86: Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
87: To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
88: Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
89: If ever you disturb our streets again,
90: Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
91: For this time, all the rest depart away:
92: You Capulet; shall go along with me:
93: And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
94: To know our further pleasure in this case,
95: To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
96: Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
97: MONTAGUE: Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
98: Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
99: BENVOLIO: Here were the servants of your adversary,
100: And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
101: I drew to part them: in the instant came
102: The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
103: Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
104: He swung about his head and cut the winds,
105: Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
106: While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
107: Came more and more and fought on part and part,
108: Till the prince came, who parted either part.
109: LADY MONTAGUE: O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
110: Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
111: BENVOLIO: Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
112: Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
113: A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
114: Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
115: That westward rooteth from the city's side,
116: So early walking did I see your son:
117: Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
118: And stole into the covert of the wood:
119: I, measuring his affections by my own,
120: That most are busied when they're most alone,
121: Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
122: And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
123: MONTAGUE: Many a morning hath he there been seen,
124: With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
125: Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
126: But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
127: Should in the furthest east begin to draw
128: The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
129: Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
130: And private in his chamber pens himself,
131: Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
132: And makes himself an artificial night:
133: Black and portentous must this humour prove,
134: Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
135: BENVOLIO: My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
136: MONTAGUE: I neither know it nor can learn of him.
137: BENVOLIO: Have you importuned him by any means?
138: MONTAGUE: Both by myself and many other friends:
139: But he, his own affections' counsellor,
140: Is to himself--I will not say how true--
141: But to himself so secret and so close,
142: So far from sounding and discovery,
143: As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
144: Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
145: Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
146: Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
147: We would as willingly give cure as know.
148: BENVOLIO: See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
149: I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
150: MONTAGUE: I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
151: To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
152: BENVOLIO: Good-morrow, cousin.
153: ROMEO: Is the day so young?
154: BENVOLIO: But new struck nine.
155: ROMEO: Ay me! sad hours seem long.
156: Was that my father that went hence so fast?
157: BENVOLIO: It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
158: ROMEO: Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
159: BENVOLIO: In love?
160: ROMEO: Out--
161: BENVOLIO: Of love?
162: ROMEO: Out of her favour, where I am in love.
163: BENVOLIO: Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
164: Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
165: ROMEO: Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
166: Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
167: Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
168: Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
169: Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
170: Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
171: O any thing, of nothing first create!
172: O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
173: Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
174: Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
175: sick health!
176: Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
177: This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
178: Dost thou not laugh?
179: BENVOLIO: No, coz, I rather weep.
180: ROMEO: Good heart, at what?
181: BENVOLIO: At thy good heart's oppression.
182: ROMEO: Why, such is love's transgression.
183: Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
184: Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
185: With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
186: Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
187: Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
188: Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
189: Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
190: What is it else? a madness most discreet,
191: A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
192: Farewell, my coz.
193: BENVOLIO: Soft! I will go along;
194: An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
195: ROMEO: Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
196: This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
197: BENVOLIO: Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
198: ROMEO: What, shall I groan and tell thee?
199: BENVOLIO: Groan! why, no.
200: But sadly tell me who.
201: ROMEO: Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
202: Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
203: In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
204: BENVOLIO: I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
205: ROMEO: A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
206: BENVOLIO: A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
207: ROMEO: Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
208: With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
209: And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
210: From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
211: She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
212: Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
213: Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
214: O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
215: That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
216: BENVOLIO: Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
217: ROMEO: She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
218: For beauty starved with her severity
219: Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
220: She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
221: To merit bliss by making me despair:
222: She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
223: Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
224: BENVOLIO: Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
225: ROMEO: O, teach me how I should forget to think.
226: BENVOLIO: By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
227: Examine other beauties.
228: ROMEO: 'Tis the way
229: To call hers exquisite, in question more:
230: These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
231: Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
232: He that is strucken blind cannot forget
233: The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
234: Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
235: What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
236: Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
237: Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
238: BENVOLIO: I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
ACT 1 SCENE 2

1: CAPULET: But Montague is bound as well as I,
2: In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
3: For men so old as we to keep the peace.
4: PARIS: Of honourable reckoning are you both;
5: And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
6: But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
7: CAPULET: But saying o'er what I have said before:
8: My child is yet a stranger in the world;
9: She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
10: Let two more summers wither in their pride,
11: Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
12: PARIS: Younger than she are happy mothers made.
13: CAPULET: And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
14: The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
15: She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
16: But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
17: My will to her consent is but a part;
18: An she agree, within her scope of choice
19: Lies my consent and fair according voice.
20: This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
21: Whereto I have invited many a guest,
22: Such as I love; and you, among the store,
23: One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
24: At my poor house look to behold this night
25: Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
26: Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
27: When well-apparell'd April on the heel
28: Of limping winter treads, even such delight
29: Among fresh female buds shall you this night
30: Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
31: And like her most whose merit most shall be:
32: Which on more view, of many mine being one
33: May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
34: Come, go with me.
35: Go, sirrah, trudge about
36: Through fair Verona; find those persons out
37: Whose names are written there, and to them say,
38: My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
39: Servant: Find them out whose names are written here! It is
40: written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
41: yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
42: his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
43: sent to find those persons whose names are here
44: writ, and can never find what names the writing
45: person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
46: BENVOLIO: Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
47: One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
48: Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
49: One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
50: Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
51: And the rank poison of the old will die.
52: ROMEO: Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
53: BENVOLIO: For what, I pray thee?
54: ROMEO: For your broken shin.
55: BENVOLIO: Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
56: ROMEO: Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
57: Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
58: Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
59: Servant: God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
60: ROMEO: Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
61: Servant: Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
62: pray, can you read any thing you see?
63: ROMEO: Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
64: Servant: Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
65: ROMEO: Stay, fellow; I can read.
66: 'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
67: County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
68: widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
69: nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
70: uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
71: Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
72: Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
73: assembly: whither should they come?
74: Servant: Up.
75: ROMEO: Whither?
76: Servant: To supper; to our house.
77: ROMEO: Whose house?
78: Servant: My master's.
79: ROMEO: Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
80: Servant: Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
81: great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
82: of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
83: Rest you merry!
84: BENVOLIO: At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
85: Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
86: With all the admired beauties of Verona:
87: Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
88: Compare her face with some that I shall show,
89: And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
90: ROMEO: When the devout religion of mine eye
91: Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
92: And these, who often drown'd could never die,
93: Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
94: One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
95: Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
96: BENVOLIO: Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
97: Herself poised with herself in either eye:
98: But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
99: Your lady's love against some other maid
100: That I will show you shining at this feast,
101: And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
102: ROMEO: I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
103: But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
ACT 1 SCENE 3

1: LADY CAPULET: Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
2: Nurse: Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
3: I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
4: God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
5: JULIET: How now! who calls?
6: Nurse: Your mother.
7: JULIET: Madam, I am here.
8: What is your will?
9: LADY CAPULET: This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
10: We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
11: I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
12: Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
13: Nurse: Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
14: LADY CAPULET: She's not fourteen.
15: Nurse: I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
16: And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
17: She is not fourteen. How long is it now
18: To Lammas-tide?
19: LADY CAPULET: A fortnight and odd days.
20: Nurse: Even or odd, of all days in the year,
21: Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
22: Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
23: Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
24: She was too good for me: but, as I said,
25: On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
26: That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
27: 'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
28: And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
29: Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
30: For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
31: Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
32: My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
33: Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
34: When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
35: Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
36: To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
37: Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
38: To bid me trudge:
39: And since that time it is eleven years;
40: For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
41: She could have run and waddled all about;
42: For even the day before, she broke her brow:
43: And then my husband--God be with his soul!
44: A' was a merry man--took up the child:
45: 'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
46: Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
47: Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
48: The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
49: To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
50: I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
51: I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
52: And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
53: LADY CAPULET: Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
54: Nurse: Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
55: To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
56: And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
57: A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
58: A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
59: 'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
60: Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
61: Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
62: JULIET: And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
63: Nurse: Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
64: Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
65: An I might live to see thee married once,
66: I have my wish.
67: LADY CAPULET: Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
68: I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
69: How stands your disposition to be married?
70: JULIET: It is an honour that I dream not of.
71: Nurse: An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
72: I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
73: LADY CAPULET: Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
74: Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
75: Are made already mothers: by my count,
76: I was your mother much upon these years
77: That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
78: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
79: Nurse: A man, young lady! lady, such a man
80: As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
81: LADY CAPULET: Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
82: Nurse: Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
83: LADY CAPULET: What say you? can you love the gentleman?
84: This night you shall behold him at our feast;
85: Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
86: And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
87: Examine every married lineament,
88: And see how one another lends content
89: And what obscured in this fair volume lies
90: Find written in the margent of his eyes.
91: This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
92: To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
93: The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
94: For fair without the fair within to hide:
95: That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
96: That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
97: So shall you share all that he doth possess,
98: By having him, making yourself no less.
99: Nurse: No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
100: LADY CAPULET: Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
101: JULIET: I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
102: But no more deep will I endart mine eye
103: Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
104: Servant: Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
105: called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
106: the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
107: hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
108: LADY CAPULET: We follow thee.
109: Juliet, the county stays.
110: Nurse: Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
ACT 1 SCENE 4

1: ROMEO: What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
2: Or shall we on without a apology?
3: BENVOLIO: The date is out of such prolixity:
4: We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
5: Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
6: Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
7: Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
8: After the prompter, for our entrance:
9: But let them measure us by what they will;
10: We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
11: ROMEO: Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
12: Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
13: MERCUTIO: Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
14: ROMEO: Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
15: With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
16: So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
17: MERCUTIO: You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
18: And soar with them above a common bound.
19: ROMEO: I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
20: To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
21: I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
22: Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
23: MERCUTIO: And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
24: Too great oppression for a tender thing.
25: ROMEO: Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
26: Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
27: MERCUTIO: If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
28: Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
29: Give me a case to put my visage in:
30: A visor for a visor! what care I
31: What curious eye doth quote deformities?
32: Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
33: BENVOLIO: Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
34: But every man betake him to his legs.
35: ROMEO: A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
36: Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
37: For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
38: I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
39: The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
40: MERCUTIO: Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
41: If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
42: Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
43: Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
44: ROMEO: Nay, that's not so.
45: MERCUTIO: I mean, sir, in delay
46: We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
47: Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
48: Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
49: ROMEO: And we mean well in going to this mask;
50: But 'tis no wit to go.
51: MERCUTIO: Why, may one ask?
52: ROMEO: I dream'd a dream to-night.
53: MERCUTIO: And so did I.
54: ROMEO: Well, what was yours?
55: MERCUTIO: That dreamers often lie.
56: ROMEO: In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
57: MERCUTIO: O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
58: She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
59: In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
60: On the fore-finger of an alderman,
61: Drawn with a team of little atomies
62: Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
63: Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
64: The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
65: The traces of the smallest spider's web,
66: The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
67: Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
68: Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
69: Not so big as a round little worm
70: Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
71: Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
72: Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
73: Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
74: And in this state she gallops night by night
75: Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
76: O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
77: O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
78: O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
79: Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
80: Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
81: Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
82: And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
83: And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
84: Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
85: Then dreams, he of another benefice:
86: Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
87: And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
88: Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
89: Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
90: Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
91: And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
92: And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
93: That plats the manes of horses in the night,
94: And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
95: Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
96: This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
97: That presses them and learns them first to bear,
98: Making them women of good carriage:
99: This is she--
100: ROMEO: Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
101: Thou talk'st of nothing.
102: MERCUTIO: True, I talk of dreams,
103: Which are the children of an idle brain,
104: Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
105: Which is as thin of substance as the air
106: And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
107: Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
108: And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
109: Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
110: BENVOLIO: This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
111: Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
112: ROMEO: I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
113: Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
114: Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
115: With this night's revels and expire the term
116: Of a despised life closed in my breast
117: By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
118: But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
119: Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
120: BENVOLIO: Strike, drum.
ACT 1 SCENE 5

1: First Servant: Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
2: shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
3: Second Servant: When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
4: hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
5: First Servant: Away with the joint-stools, remove the
6: court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
7: me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
8: the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
9: Antony, and Potpan!
10: Second Servant: Ay, boy, ready.
11: First Servant: You are looked for and called for, asked for and
12: sought for, in the great chamber.
13: Second Servant: We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
14: brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
15: CAPULET: Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
16: Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
17: Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
18: Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
19: She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
20: Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
21: That I have worn a visor and could tell
22: A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
23: Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
24: You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
25: A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
26: More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
27: And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
28: Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
29: Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
30: For you and I are past our dancing days:
31: How long is't now since last yourself and I
32: Were in a mask?
33: Second Capulet: By'r lady, thirty years.
34: CAPULET: What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
35: 'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
36: Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
37: Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
38: Second Capulet: 'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
39: His son is thirty.
40: CAPULET: Will you tell me that?
41: His son was but a ward two years ago.
42: ROMEO: [To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
43: enrich the hand
44: Of yonder knight?
45: Servant: I know not, sir.
46: ROMEO: O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
47: It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
48: Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
49: Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
50: So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
51: As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
52: The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
53: And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
54: Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
55: For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
56: TYBALT: This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
57: Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
58: Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
59: To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
60: Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
61: To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
62: CAPULET: Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
63: TYBALT: Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
64: A villain that is hither come in spite,
65: To scorn at our solemnity this night.
66: CAPULET: Young Romeo is it?
67: TYBALT: 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
68: CAPULET: Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
69: He bears him like a portly gentleman;
70: And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
71: To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
72: I would not for the wealth of all the town
73: Here in my house do him disparagement:
74: Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
75: It is my will, the which if thou respect,
76: Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
77: And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
78: TYBALT: It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
79: I'll not endure him.
80: CAPULET: He shall be endured:
81: What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
82: Am I the master here, or you? go to.
83: You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
84: You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
85: You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
86: TYBALT: Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
87: CAPULET: Go to, go to;
88: You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
89: This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
90: You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
91: Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
92: Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
93: I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
94: TYBALT: Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
95: Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
96: I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
97: Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
98: ROMEO: [To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
99: This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
100: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
101: To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
102: JULIET: Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
103: Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
104: For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
105: And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
106: ROMEO: Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
107: JULIET: Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
108: ROMEO: O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
109: They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
110: JULIET: Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
111: ROMEO: Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
112: Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
113: JULIET: Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
114: ROMEO: Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
115: Give me my sin again.
116: JULIET: You kiss by the book.
117: Nurse: Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
118: ROMEO: What is her mother?
119: Nurse: Marry, bachelor,
120: Her mother is the lady of the house,
121: And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
122: I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
123: I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
124: Shall have the chinks.
125: ROMEO: Is she a Capulet?
126: O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
127: BENVOLIO: Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
128: ROMEO: Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
129: CAPULET: Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
130: We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
131: Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
132: I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
133: More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
134: Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
135: I'll to my rest.
136: JULIET: Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
137: Nurse: The son and heir of old Tiberio.
138: JULIET: What's he that now is going out of door?
139: Nurse: Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
140: JULIET: What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
141: Nurse: I know not.
142: JULIET: Go ask his name: if he be married.
143: My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
144: Nurse: His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
145: The only son of your great enemy.
146: JULIET: My only love sprung from my only hate!
147: Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
148: Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
149: That I must love a loathed enemy.
150: Nurse: What's this? what's this?
151: JULIET: A rhyme I learn'd even now
152: Of one I danced withal.
ACT 2 SCENE 0

1: Chorus: Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
2: And young affection gapes to be his heir;
3: That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
4: With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
5: Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
6: Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
7: But to his foe supposed he must complain,
8: And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
9: Being held a foe, he may not have access
10: To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
11: And she as much in love, her means much less
12: To meet her new-beloved any where:
13: But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
14: Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
ACT 2 SCENE 1

1: ROMEO: Can I go forward when my heart is here?
2: Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
3: BENVOLIO: Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
4: MERCUTIO: He is wise;
5: And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
6: BENVOLIO: He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
7: Call, good Mercutio.
8: MERCUTIO: Nay, I'll conjure too.
9: Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
10: Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
11: Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
12: Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
13: Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
14: One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
15: Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
16: When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
17: He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
18: The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
19: I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
20: By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
21: By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
22: And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
23: That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
24: BENVOLIO: And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
25: MERCUTIO: This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
26: To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
27: Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
28: Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
29: That were some spite: my invocation
30: Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
31: I conjure only but to raise up him.
32: BENVOLIO: Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
33: To be consorted with the humorous night:
34: Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
35: MERCUTIO: If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
36: Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
37: And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
38: As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
39: Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
40: An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
41: Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
42: This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
43: Come, shall we go?
44: BENVOLIO: Go, then; for 'tis in vain
45: To seek him here that means not to be found.
ACT 2 SCENE 2

1: ROMEO: He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
2: But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
3: It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
4: Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
5: Who is already sick and pale with grief,
6: That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
7: Be not her maid, since she is envious;
8: Her vestal livery is but sick and green
9: And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
10: It is my lady, O, it is my love!
11: O, that she knew she were!
12: She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
13: Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
14: I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
15: Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
16: Having some business, do entreat her eyes
17: To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
18: What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
19: The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
20: As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
21: Would through the airy region stream so bright
22: That birds would sing and think it were not night.
23: See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
24: O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
25: That I might touch that cheek!
26: JULIET: Ay me!
27: ROMEO: She speaks:
28: O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
29: As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
30: As is a winged messenger of heaven
31: Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
32: Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
33: When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
34: And sails upon the bosom of the air.
35: JULIET: O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
36: Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
37: Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
38: And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
39: ROMEO: [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
40: JULIET: 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
41: Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
42: What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
43: Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
44: Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
45: What's in a name? that which we call a rose
46: By any other name would smell as sweet;
47: So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
48: Retain that dear perfection which he owes
49: Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
50: And for that name which is no part of thee
51: Take all myself.
52: ROMEO: I take thee at thy word:
53: Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
54: Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
55: JULIET: What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
56: So stumblest on my counsel?
57: ROMEO: By a name
58: I know not how to tell thee who I am:
59: My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
60: Because it is an enemy to thee;
61: Had I it written, I would tear the word.
62: JULIET: My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
63: Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
64: Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
65: ROMEO: Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
66: JULIET: How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
67: The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
68: And the place death, considering who thou art,
69: If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
70: ROMEO: With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
71: For stony limits cannot hold love out,
72: And what love can do that dares love attempt;
73: Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
74: JULIET: If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
75: ROMEO: Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
76: Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
77: And I am proof against their enmity.
78: JULIET: I would not for the world they saw thee here.
79: ROMEO: I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
80: And but thou love me, let them find me here:
81: My life were better ended by their hate,
82: Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
83: JULIET: By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
84: ROMEO: By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
85: He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
86: I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
87: As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
88: I would adventure for such merchandise.
89: JULIET: Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
90: Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
91: For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
92: Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
93: What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
94: Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
95: And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
96: Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
97: Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
98: If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
99: Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
100: I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
101: So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
102: In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
103: And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
104: But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
105: Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
106: I should have been more strange, I must confess,
107: But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
108: My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
109: And not impute this yielding to light love,
110: Which the dark night hath so discovered.
111: ROMEO: Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
112: That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
113: JULIET: O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
114: That monthly changes in her circled orb,
115: Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
116: ROMEO: What shall I swear by?
117: JULIET: Do not swear at all;
118: Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
119: Which is the god of my idolatry,
120: And I'll believe thee.
121: ROMEO: If my heart's dear love--
122: JULIET: Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
123: I have no joy of this contract to-night:
124: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
125: Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
126: Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
127: This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
128: May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
129: Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
130: Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
131: ROMEO: O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
132: JULIET: What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
133: ROMEO: The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
134: JULIET: I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
135: And yet I would it were to give again.
136: ROMEO: Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
137: JULIET: But to be frank, and give it thee again.
138: And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
139: My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
140: My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
141: The more I have, for both are infinite.
142: I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
143: Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
144: Stay but a little, I will come again.
145: ROMEO: O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
146: Being in night, all this is but a dream,
147: Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
148: JULIET: Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
149: If that thy bent of love be honourable,
150: Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
151: By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
152: Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
153: And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
154: And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
155: Nurse: [Within] Madam!
156: JULIET: I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
157: I do beseech thee--
158: Nurse: [Within] Madam!
159: JULIET: By and by, I come:--
160: To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
161: To-morrow will I send.
162: ROMEO: So thrive my soul--
163: JULIET: A thousand times good night!
164: ROMEO: A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
165: Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
166: their books,
167: But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
168: JULIET: Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
169: To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
170: Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
171: Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
172: And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
173: With repetition of my Romeo's name.
174: ROMEO: It is my soul that calls upon my name:
175: How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
176: Like softest music to attending ears!
177: JULIET: Romeo!
178: ROMEO: My dear?
179: JULIET: At what o'clock to-morrow
180: Shall I send to thee?
181: ROMEO: At the hour of nine.
182: JULIET: I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
183: I have forgot why I did call thee back.
184: ROMEO: Let me stand here till thou remember it.
185: JULIET: I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
186: Remembering how I love thy company.
187: ROMEO: And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
188: Forgetting any other home but this.
189: JULIET: 'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
190: And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
191: Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
192: Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
193: And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
194: So loving-jealous of his liberty.
195: ROMEO: I would I were thy bird.
196: JULIET: Sweet, so would I:
197: Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
198: Good night, good night! parting is such
199: sweet sorrow,
200: That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
201: ROMEO: Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
202: Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
203: Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
204: His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
ACT 2 SCENE 3

1: FRIAR LAURENCE: The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
2: Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
3: And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
4: From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
5: Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
6: The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
7: I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
8: With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
9: The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
10: What is her burying grave that is her womb,
11: And from her womb children of divers kind
12: We sucking on her natural bosom find,
13: Many for many virtues excellent,
14: None but for some and yet all different.
15: O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
16: In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
17: For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
18: But to the earth some special good doth give,
19: Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
20: Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
21: Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
22: And vice sometimes by action dignified.
23: Within the infant rind of this small flower
24: Poison hath residence and medicine power:
25: For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
26: Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
27: Two such opposed kings encamp them still
28: In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
29: And where the worser is predominant,
30: Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
31: ROMEO: Good morrow, father.
32: FRIAR LAURENCE: Benedicite!
33: What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
34: Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
35: So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
36: Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
37: And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
38: But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
39: Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
40: Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
41: Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
42: Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
43: Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
44: ROMEO: That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
45: FRIAR LAURENCE: God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
46: ROMEO: With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
47: I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
48: FRIAR LAURENCE: That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
49: ROMEO: I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
50: I have been feasting with mine enemy,
51: Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
52: That's by me wounded: both our remedies
53: Within thy help and holy physic lies:
54: I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
55: My intercession likewise steads my foe.
56: FRIAR LAURENCE: Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
57: Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
58: ROMEO: Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
59: On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
60: As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
61: And all combined, save what thou must combine
62: By holy marriage: when and where and how
63: We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
64: I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
65: That thou consent to marry us to-day.
66: FRIAR LAURENCE: Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
67: Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
68: So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
69: Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
70: Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
71: Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
72: How much salt water thrown away in waste,
73: To season love, that of it doth not taste!
74: The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
75: Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
76: Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
77: Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
78: If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
79: Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
80: And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
81: Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
82: ROMEO: Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
83: FRIAR LAURENCE: For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
84: ROMEO: And bad'st me bury love.
85: FRIAR LAURENCE: Not in a grave,
86: To lay one in, another out to have.
87: ROMEO: I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
88: Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
89: The other did not so.
90: FRIAR LAURENCE: O, she knew well
91: Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
92: But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
93: In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
94: For this alliance may so happy prove,
95: To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
96: ROMEO: O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
97: FRIAR LAURENCE: Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
ACT 2 SCENE 4

1: MERCUTIO: Where the devil should this Romeo be?
2: Came he not home to-night?
3: BENVOLIO: Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
4: MERCUTIO: Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
5: Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
6: BENVOLIO: Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
7: Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
8: MERCUTIO: A challenge, on my life.
9: BENVOLIO: Romeo will answer it.
10: MERCUTIO: Any man that can write may answer a letter.
11: BENVOLIO: Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
12: dares, being dared.
13: MERCUTIO: Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
14: white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
15: love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
16: blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
17: encounter Tybalt?
18: BENVOLIO: Why, what is Tybalt?
19: MERCUTIO: More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
20: the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
21: you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
22: proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
23: the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
24: button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
25: very first house, of the first and second cause:
26: ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
27: hai!
28: BENVOLIO: The what?
29: MERCUTIO: The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
30: fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
31: a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
32: whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
33: grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
34: these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
35: perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
36: that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
37: bones, their bones!
38: BENVOLIO: Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
39: MERCUTIO: Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
40: how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
41: that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
42: kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
43: be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
44: Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
45: eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
46: Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
47: to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
48: fairly last night.
49: ROMEO: Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
50: MERCUTIO: The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
51: ROMEO: Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
52: such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
53: MERCUTIO: That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
54: constrains a man to bow in the hams.
55: ROMEO: Meaning, to court'sy.
56: MERCUTIO: Thou hast most kindly hit it.
57: ROMEO: A most courteous exposition.
58: MERCUTIO: Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
59: ROMEO: Pink for flower.
60: MERCUTIO: Right.
61: ROMEO: Why, then is my pump well flowered.
62: MERCUTIO: Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
63: worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
64: is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
65: ROMEO: O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
66: singleness.
67: MERCUTIO: Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
68: ROMEO: Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
69: MERCUTIO: Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
70: done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
71: thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
72: was I with you there for the goose?
73: ROMEO: Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
74: not there for the goose.
75: MERCUTIO: I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
76: ROMEO: Nay, good goose, bite not.
77: MERCUTIO: Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
78: sharp sauce.
79: ROMEO: And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
80: MERCUTIO: O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
81: inch narrow to an ell broad!
82: ROMEO: I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
83: to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
84: MERCUTIO: Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
85: now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
86: thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
87: for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
88: that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
89: BENVOLIO: Stop there, stop there.
90: MERCUTIO: Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
91: BENVOLIO: Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
92: MERCUTIO: O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
93: for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
94: meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
95: ROMEO: Here's goodly gear!
96: MERCUTIO: A sail, a sail!
97: BENVOLIO: Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
98: Nurse: Peter!
99: PETER: Anon!
100: Nurse: My fan, Peter.
101: MERCUTIO: Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
102: fairer face.
103: Nurse: God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
104: MERCUTIO: God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
105: Nurse: Is it good den?
106: MERCUTIO: 'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
107: dial is now upon the prick of noon.
108: Nurse: Out upon you! what a man are you!
109: ROMEO: One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
110: mar.
111: Nurse: By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
112: quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
113: may find the young Romeo?
114: ROMEO: I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
115: you have found him than he was when you sought him:
116: I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
117: Nurse: You say well.
118: MERCUTIO: Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
119: wisely, wisely.
120: Nurse: if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
121: you.
122: BENVOLIO: She will indite him to some supper.
123: MERCUTIO: A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
124: ROMEO: What hast thou found?
125: MERCUTIO: No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
126: that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
127: An old hare hoar,
128: And an old hare hoar,
129: Is very good meat in lent
130: But a hare that is hoar
131: Is too much for a score,
132: When it hoars ere it be spent.
133: Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
134: to dinner, thither.
135: ROMEO: I will follow you.
136: MERCUTIO: Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
137: 'lady, lady, lady.'
138: Nurse: Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
139: merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
140: ROMEO: A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
141: and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
142: to in a month.
143: Nurse: An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
144: down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
145: Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
146: Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
147: none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
148: too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
149: PETER: I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
150: should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
151: draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
152: good quarrel, and the law on my side.
153: Nurse: Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
154: me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
155: and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
156: out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
157: but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
158: a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
159: kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
160: is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
161: with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
162: to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
163: ROMEO: Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
164: protest unto thee--
165: Nurse: Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
166: Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
167: ROMEO: What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
168: Nurse: I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
169: I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
170: ROMEO: Bid her devise
171: Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
172: And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
173: Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
174: Nurse: No truly sir; not a penny.
175: ROMEO: Go to; I say you shall.
176: Nurse: This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
177: ROMEO: And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
178: Within this hour my man shall be with thee
179: And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
180: Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
181: Must be my convoy in the secret night.
182: Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
183: Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
184: Nurse: Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
185: ROMEO: What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
186: Nurse: Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
187: Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
188: ROMEO: I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
189: NURSE: Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
190: Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
191: is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
192: lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
193: see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
194: sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
195: man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
196: as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
197: rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
198: ROMEO: Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
199: Nurse: Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
200: the--No; I know it begins with some other
201: letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
202: it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
203: to hear it.
204: ROMEO: Commend me to thy lady.
205: Nurse: Ay, a thousand times.
206: Peter!
207: PETER: Anon!
208: Nurse: Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.
ACT 2 SCENE 5

1: JULIET: The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
2: In half an hour she promised to return.
3: Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
4: O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
5: Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
6: Driving back shadows over louring hills:
7: Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
8: And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
9: Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
10: Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
11: Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
12: Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
13: She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
14: My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
15: And his to me:
16: But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
17: Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
18: O God, she comes!
19: O honey nurse, what news?
20: Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
21: Nurse: Peter, stay at the gate.
22: JULIET: Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
23: Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
24: If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
25: By playing it to me with so sour a face.
26: Nurse: I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
27: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
28: JULIET: I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
29: Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
30: Nurse: Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
31: Do you not see that I am out of breath?
32: JULIET: How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
33: To say to me that thou art out of breath?
34: The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
35: Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
36: Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
37: Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
38: Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
39: Nurse: Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
40: how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
41: face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
42: all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
43: though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
44: past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
45: but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
46: ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
47: JULIET: No, no: but all this did I know before.
48: What says he of our marriage? what of that?
49: Nurse: Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
50: It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
51: My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
52: Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
53: To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
54: JULIET: I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
55: Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
56: Nurse: Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
57: courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
58: warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
59: JULIET: Where is my mother! why, she is within;
60: Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
61: 'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
62: Where is your mother?'
63: Nurse: O God's lady dear!
64: Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
65: Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
66: Henceforward do your messages yourself.
67: JULIET: Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
68: Nurse: Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
69: JULIET: I have.
70: Nurse: Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
71: There stays a husband to make you a wife:
72: Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
73: They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
74: Hie you to church; I must another way,
75: To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
76: Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
77: I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
78: But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
79: Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
80: JULIET: Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
ACT 2 SCENE 6

1: FRIAR LAURENCE: So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
2: That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
3: ROMEO: Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
4: It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
5: That one short minute gives me in her sight:
6: Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
7: Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
8: It is enough I may but call her mine.
9: FRIAR LAURENCE: These violent delights have violent ends
10: And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
11: Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
12: Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
13: And in the taste confounds the appetite:
14: Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
15: Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
16: Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
17: Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
18: A lover may bestride the gossamer
19: That idles in the wanton summer air,
20: And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
21: JULIET: Good even to my ghostly confessor.
22: FRIAR LAURENCE: Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
23: JULIET: As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
24: ROMEO: Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
25: Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
26: To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
27: This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
28: Unfold the imagined happiness that both
29: Receive in either by this dear encounter.
30: JULIET: Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
31: Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
32: They are but beggars that can count their worth;
33: But my true love is grown to such excess
34: I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
ACT 3 SCENE 1

1: BENVOLIO: I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
2: The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
3: And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
4: For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
5: MERCUTIO: Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
6: enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
7: upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
8: thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
9: it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
10: BENVOLIO: Am I like such a fellow?
11: MERCUTIO: Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
12: any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
13: soon moody to be moved.
14: BENVOLIO: And what to?
15: MERCUTIO: Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
16: shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
17: thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
18: or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
19: wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
20: other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
21: eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
22: Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
23: meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
24: an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
25: man for coughing in the street, because he hath
26: wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
27: didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
28: his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
29: tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
30: wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
31: BENVOLIO: An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
32: should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
33: MERCUTIO: The fee-simple! O simple!
34: BENVOLIO: By my head, here come the Capulets.
35: MERCUTIO: By my heel, I care not.
36: TYBALT: Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
37: Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
38: MERCUTIO: And but one word with one of us? couple it with
39: something; make it a word and a blow.
40: TYBALT: You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
41: will give me occasion.
42: MERCUTIO: Could you not take some occasion without giving?
43: TYBALT: Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
44: MERCUTIO: Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
45: thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
46: discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
47: make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
48: BENVOLIO: We talk here in the public haunt of men:
49: Either withdraw unto some private place,
50: And reason coldly of your grievances,
51: Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
52: MERCUTIO: Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
53: I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
54: TYBALT: Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
55: MERCUTIO: But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
56: Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
57: Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
58: TYBALT: Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
59: No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
60: ROMEO: Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
61: Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
62: To such a greeting: villain am I none;
63: Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
64: TYBALT: Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
65: That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
66: ROMEO: I do protest, I never injured thee,
67: But love thee better than thou canst devise,
68: Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
69: And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
70: As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
71: MERCUTIO: O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
72: Alla stoccata carries it away.
73: Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
74: TYBALT: What wouldst thou have with me?
75: MERCUTIO: Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
76: lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
77: shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
78: eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
79: by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
80: ears ere it be out.
81: TYBALT: I am for you.
82: ROMEO: Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
83: MERCUTIO: Come, sir, your passado.
84: ROMEO: Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
85: Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
86: Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
87: Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
88: Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
89: MERCUTIO: I am hurt.
90: A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
91: Is he gone, and hath nothing?
92: BENVOLIO: What, art thou hurt?
93: MERCUTIO: Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
94: Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
95: ROMEO: Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
96: MERCUTIO: No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
97: church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
98: me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
99: am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
100: both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
101: cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
102: rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
103: arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
104: was hurt under your arm.
105: ROMEO: I thought all for the best.
106: MERCUTIO: Help me into some house, Benvolio,
107: Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
108: They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
109: And soundly too: your houses!
110: ROMEO: This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
111: My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
112: In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
113: With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
114: Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
115: Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
116: And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
117: BENVOLIO: O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
118: That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
119: Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
120: ROMEO: This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
121: This but begins the woe, others must end.
122: BENVOLIO: Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
123: ROMEO: Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
124: Away to heaven, respective lenity,
125: And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
126: Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
127: That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
128: Is but a little way above our heads,
129: Staying for thine to keep him company:
130: Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
131: TYBALT: Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
132: Shalt with him hence.
133: ROMEO: This shall determine that.
134: BENVOLIO: Romeo, away, be gone!
135: The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
136: Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
137: If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
138: ROMEO: O, I am fortune's fool!
139: BENVOLIO: Why dost thou stay?
140: First Citizen: Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
141: Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
142: BENVOLIO: There lies that Tybalt.
143: First Citizen: Up, sir, go with me;
144: I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
145: PRINCE: Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
146: BENVOLIO: O noble prince, I can discover all
147: The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
148: There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
149: That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
150: LADY CAPULET: Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
151: O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
152: O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
153: For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
154: O cousin, cousin!
155: PRINCE: Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
156: BENVOLIO: Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
157: Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
158: How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
159: Your high displeasure: all this uttered
160: With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
161: Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
162: Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
163: With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
164: Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
165: And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
166: Cold death aside, and with the other sends
167: It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
168: Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
169: 'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
170: his tongue,
171: His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
172: And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
173: An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
174: Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
175: But by and by comes back to Romeo,
176: Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
177: And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
178: Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
179: And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
180: This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
181: LADY CAPULET: He is a kinsman to the Montague;
182: Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
183: Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
184: And all those twenty could but kill one life.
185: I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
186: Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
187: PRINCE: Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
188: Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
189: MONTAGUE: Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
190: His fault concludes but what the law should end,
191: The life of Tybalt.
192: PRINCE: And for that offence
193: Immediately we do exile him hence:
194: I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
195: My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
196: But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
197: That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
198: I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
199: Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
200: Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
201: Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
202: Bear hence this body and attend our will:
203: Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
ACT 3 SCENE 2

1: JULIET: Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
2: Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
3: As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
4: And bring in cloudy night immediately.
5: Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
6: That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
7: Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
8: Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
9: By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
10: It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
11: Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
12: And learn me how to lose a winning match,
13: Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
14: Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
15: With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
16: Think true love acted simple modesty.
17: Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
18: For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
19: Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
20: Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
21: Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
22: Take him and cut him out in little stars,
23: And he will make the face of heaven so fine
24: That all the world will be in love with night
25: And pay no worship to the garish sun.
26: O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
27: But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
28: Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
29: As is the night before some festival
30: To an impatient child that hath new robes
31: And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
32: And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
33: But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
34: Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
35: That Romeo bid thee fetch?
36: Nurse: Ay, ay, the cords.
37: JULIET: Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
38: Nurse: Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
39: We are undone, lady, we are undone!
40: Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
41: JULIET: Can heaven be so envious?
42: Nurse: Romeo can,
43: Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
44: Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
45: JULIET: What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
46: This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
47: Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
48: And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
49: Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
50: I am not I, if there be such an I;
51: Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
52: If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
53: Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
54: Nurse: I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
55: God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
56: A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
57: Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
58: All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
59: JULIET: O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
60: To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
61: Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
62: And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
63: Nurse: O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
64: O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
65: That ever I should live to see thee dead!
66: JULIET: What storm is this that blows so contrary?
67: Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
68: My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
69: Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
70: For who is living, if those two are gone?
71: Nurse: Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
72: Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
73: JULIET: O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
74: Nurse: It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
75: JULIET: O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
76: Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
77: Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
78: Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
79: Despised substance of divinest show!
80: Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
81: A damned saint, an honourable villain!
82: O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
83: When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
84: In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
85: Was ever book containing such vile matter
86: So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
87: In such a gorgeous palace!
88: Nurse: There's no trust,
89: No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
90: All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
91: Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
92: These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
93: Shame come to Romeo!
94: JULIET: Blister'd be thy tongue
95: For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
96: Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
97: For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
98: Sole monarch of the universal earth.
99: O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
100: Nurse: Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
101: JULIET: Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
102: Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
103: When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
104: But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
105: That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
106: Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
107: Your tributary drops belong to woe,
108: Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
109: My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
110: And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
111: All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
112: Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
113: That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
114: But, O, it presses to my memory,
115: Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
116: 'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
117: That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
118: Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
119: Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
120: Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
121: And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
122: Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
123: Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
124: Which modern lamentations might have moved?
125: But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
126: 'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
127: Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
128: All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
129: There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
130: In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
131: Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
132: Nurse: Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
133: Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
134: JULIET: Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
135: When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
136: Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
137: Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
138: He made you for a highway to my bed;
139: But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
140: Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
141: And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
142: Nurse: Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
143: To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
144: Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
145: I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
146: JULIET: O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
147: And bid him come to take his last farewell.
ACT 3 SCENE 3

1: FRIAR LAURENCE: Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
2: Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
3: And thou art wedded to calamity.
4: ROMEO: Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
5: What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
6: That I yet know not?
7: FRIAR LAURENCE: Too familiar
8: Is my dear son with such sour company:
9: I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
10: ROMEO: What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
11: FRIAR LAURENCE: A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
12: Not body's death, but body's banishment.
13: ROMEO: Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
14: For exile hath more terror in his look,
15: Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
16: FRIAR LAURENCE: Hence from Verona art thou banished:
17: Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
18: ROMEO: There is no world without Verona walls,
19: But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
20: Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
21: And world's exile is death: then banished,
22: Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
23: Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
24: And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
25: FRIAR LAURENCE: O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
26: Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
27: Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
28: And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
29: This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
30: ROMEO: 'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
31: Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
32: And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
33: Live here in heaven and may look on her;
34: But Romeo may not: more validity,
35: More honourable state, more courtship lives
36: In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
37: On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
38: And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
39: Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
40: Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
41: But Romeo may not; he is banished:
42: Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
43: They are free men, but I am banished.
44: And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
45: Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
46: No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
47: But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
48: O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
49: Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
50: Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
51: A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
52: To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
53: FRIAR LAURENCE: Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
54: ROMEO: O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
55: FRIAR LAURENCE: I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
56: Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
57: To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
58: ROMEO: Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
59: Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
60: Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
61: It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
62: FRIAR LAURENCE: O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
63: ROMEO: How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
64: FRIAR LAURENCE: Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
65: ROMEO: Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
66: Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
67: An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
68: Doting like me and like me banished,
69: Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
70: And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
71: Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
72: FRIAR LAURENCE: Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
73: ROMEO: Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
74: Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
75: FRIAR LAURENCE: Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
76: Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
77: Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
78: What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
79: Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
80: Nurse: [Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
81: my errand;
82: I come from Lady Juliet.
83: FRIAR LAURENCE: Welcome, then.
84: Nurse: O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
85: Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
86: FRIAR LAURENCE: There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
87: Nurse: O, he is even in my mistress' case,
88: Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
89: Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
90: Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
91: Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
92: For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
93: Why should you fall into so deep an O?
94: ROMEO: Nurse!
95: Nurse: Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
96: ROMEO: Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
97: Doth she not think me an old murderer,
98: Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
99: With blood removed but little from her own?
100: Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
101: My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
102: Nurse: O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
103: And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
104: And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
105: And then down falls again.
106: ROMEO: As if that name,
107: Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
108: Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
109: Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
110: In what vile part of this anatomy
111: Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
112: The hateful mansion.
113: FRIAR LAURENCE: Hold thy desperate hand:
114: Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
115: Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
116: The unreasonable fury of a beast:
117: Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
118: Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
119: Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
120: I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
121: Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
122: And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
123: By doing damned hate upon thyself?
124: Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
125: Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
126: In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
127: Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
128: Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
129: And usest none in that true use indeed
130: Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
131: Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
132: Digressing from the valour of a man;
133: Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
134: Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
135: Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
136: Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
137: Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
138: Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
139: And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
140: What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
141: For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
142: There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
143: But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
144: The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
145: And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
146: A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
147: Happiness courts thee in her best array;
148: But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
149: Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
150: Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
151: Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
152: Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
153: But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
154: For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
155: Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
156: To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
157: Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
158: With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
159: Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
160: Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
161: And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
162: Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
163: Romeo is coming.
164: Nurse: O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
165: To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
166: My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
167: ROMEO: Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
168: Nurse: Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
169: Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
170: ROMEO: How well my comfort is revived by this!
171: FRIAR LAURENCE: Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
172: Either be gone before the watch be set,
173: Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
174: Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
175: And he shall signify from time to time
176: Every good hap to you that chances here:
177: Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
178: ROMEO: But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
179: It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
ACT 3 SCENE 4

1: CAPULET: Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
2: That we have had no time to move our daughter:
3: Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
4: And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
5: 'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
6: I promise you, but for your company,
7: I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
8: PARIS: These times of woe afford no time to woo.
9: Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
10: LADY CAPULET: I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
11: To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
12: CAPULET: Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
13: Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
14: In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
15: Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
16: Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
17: And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
18: But, soft! what day is this?
19: PARIS: Monday, my lord,
20: CAPULET: Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
21: O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
22: She shall be married to this noble earl.
23: Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
24: We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
25: For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
26: It may be thought we held him carelessly,
27: Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
28: Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
29: And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
30: PARIS: My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
31: CAPULET: Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
32: Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
33: Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
34: Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
35: Afore me! it is so very very late,
36: That we may call it early by and by.
37: Good night.
ACT 3 SCENE 5

1: JULIET: Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
2: It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
3: That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
4: Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
5: Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
6: ROMEO: It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
7: No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
8: Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
9: Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
10: Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
11: I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
12: JULIET: Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
13: It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
14: To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
15: And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
16: Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
17: ROMEO: Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
18: I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
19: I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
20: 'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
21: Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
22: The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
23: I have more care to stay than will to go:
24: Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
25: How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
26: JULIET: It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
27: It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
28: Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
29: Some say the lark makes sweet division;
30: This doth not so, for she divideth us:
31: Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
32: O, now I would they had changed voices too!
33: Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
34: Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
35: O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
36: ROMEO: More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
37: Nurse: Madam!
38: JULIET: Nurse?
39: Nurse: Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
40: The day is broke; be wary, look about.
41: JULIET: Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
42: ROMEO: Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
43: JULIET: Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
44: I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
45: For in a minute there are many days:
46: O, by this count I shall be much in years
47: Ere I again behold my Romeo!
48: ROMEO: Farewell!
49: I will omit no opportunity
50: That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
51: JULIET: O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
52: ROMEO: I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
53: For sweet discourses in our time to come.
54: JULIET: O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
55: Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
56: As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
57: Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
58: ROMEO: And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
59: Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
60: JULIET: O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
61: If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
62: That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
63: For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
64: But send him back.
65: LADY CAPULET: [Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
66: JULIET: Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
67: Is she not down so late, or up so early?
68: What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
69: LADY CAPULET: Why, how now, Juliet!
70: JULIET: Madam, I am not well.
71: LADY CAPULET: Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
72: What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
73: An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
74: Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
75: But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
76: JULIET: Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
77: LADY CAPULET: So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
78: Which you weep for.
79: JULIET: Feeling so the loss,
80: Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
81: LADY CAPULET: Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
82: As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
83: JULIET: What villain madam?
84: LADY CAPULET: That same villain, Romeo.
85: JULIET: [Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
86: God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
87: And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
88: LADY CAPULET: That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
89: JULIET: Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
90: Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
91: LADY CAPULET: We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
92: Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
93: Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
94: Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
95: That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
96: And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
97: JULIET: Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
98: With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
99: Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
100: Madam, if you could find out but a man
101: To bear a poison, I would temper it;
102: That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
103: Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
104: To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
105: To wreak the love I bore my cousin
106: Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
107: LADY CAPULET: Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
108: But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
109: JULIET: And joy comes well in such a needy time:
110: What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
111: LADY CAPULET: Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
112: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
113: Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
114: That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
115: JULIET: Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
116: LADY CAPULET: Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
117: The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
118: The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
119: Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
120: JULIET: Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
121: He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
122: I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
123: Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
124: I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
125: I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
126: It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
127: Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
128: LADY CAPULET: Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
129: And see how he will take it at your hands.
130: CAPULET: When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
131: But for the sunset of my brother's son
132: It rains downright.
133: How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
134: Evermore showering? In one little body
135: Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
136: For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
137: Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
138: Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
139: Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
140: Without a sudden calm, will overset
141: Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
142: Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
143: LADY CAPULET: Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
144: I would the fool were married to her grave!
145: CAPULET: Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
146: How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
147: Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
148: Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
149: So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
150: JULIET: Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
151: Proud can I never be of what I hate;
152: But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
153: CAPULET: How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
154: 'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
155: And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
156: Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
157: But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
158: To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
159: Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
160: Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
161: You tallow-face!
162: LADY CAPULET: Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
163: JULIET: Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
164: Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
165: CAPULET: Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
166: I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
167: Or never after look me in the face:
168: Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
169: My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
170: That God had lent us but this only child;
171: But now I see this one is one too much,
172: And that we have a curse in having her:
173: Out on her, hilding!
174: Nurse: God in heaven bless her!
175: You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
176: CAPULET: And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
177: Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
178: Nurse: I speak no treason.
179: CAPULET: O, God ye god-den.
180: Nurse: May not one speak?
181: CAPULET: Peace, you mumbling fool!
182: Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
183: For here we need it not.
184: LADY CAPULET: You are too hot.
185: CAPULET: God's bread! it makes me mad:
186: Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
187: Alone, in company, still my care hath been
188: To have her match'd: and having now provided
189: A gentleman of noble parentage,
190: Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
191: Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
192: Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
193: And then to have a wretched puling fool,
194: A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
195: To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
196: I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
197: But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
198: Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
199: Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
200: Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
201: An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
202: And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
203: the streets,
204: For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
205: Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
206: Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
207: JULIET: Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
208: That sees into the bottom of my grief?
209: O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
210: Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
211: Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
212: In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
213: LADY CAPULET: Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
214: Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
215: JULIET: O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
216: My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
217: How shall that faith return again to earth,
218: Unless that husband send it me from heaven
219: By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
220: Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
221: Upon so soft a subject as myself!
222: What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
223: Some comfort, nurse.
224: Nurse: Faith, here it is.
225: Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
226: That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
227: Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
228: Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
229: I think it best you married with the county.
230: O, he's a lovely gentleman!
231: Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
232: Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
233: As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
234: I think you are happy in this second match,
235: For it excels your first: or if it did not,
236: Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
237: As living here and you no use of him.
238: JULIET: Speakest thou from thy heart?
239: Nurse: And from my soul too;
240: Or else beshrew them both.
241: JULIET: Amen!
242: Nurse: What?
243: JULIET: Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
244: Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
245: Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
246: To make confession and to be absolved.
247: Nurse: Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
ACT 4 SCENE 1

1: FRIAR LAURENCE: On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
2: PARIS: My father Capulet will have it so;
3: And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
4: FRIAR LAURENCE: You say you do not know the lady's mind:
5: Uneven is the course, I like it not.
6: PARIS: Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
7: And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
8: For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
9: Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
10: That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
11: And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
12: To stop the inundation of her tears;
13: Which, too much minded by herself alone,
14: May be put from her by society:
15: Now do you know the reason of this haste.
16: FRIAR LAURENCE: [Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
17: Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
18: PARIS: Happily met, my lady and my wife!
19: JULIET: That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
20: PARIS: That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
21: JULIET: What must be shall be.
22: FRIAR LAURENCE: That's a certain text.
23: PARIS: Come you to make confession to this father?
24: JULIET: To answer that, I should confess to you.
25: PARIS: Do not deny to him that you love me.
26: JULIET: I will confess to you that I love him.
27: PARIS: So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
28: JULIET: If I do so, it will be of more price,
29: Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
30: PARIS: Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
31: JULIET: The tears have got small victory by that;
32: For it was bad enough before their spite.
33: PARIS: Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
34: JULIET: That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
35: And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
36: PARIS: Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
37: JULIET: It may be so, for it is not mine own.
38: Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
39: Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
40: FRIAR LAURENCE: My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
41: My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
42: PARIS: God shield I should disturb devotion!
43: Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
44: Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
45: JULIET: O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
46: Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
47: FRIAR LAURENCE: Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
48: It strains me past the compass of my wits:
49: I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
50: On Thursday next be married to this county.
51: JULIET: Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
52: Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
53: If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
54: Do thou but call my resolution wise,
55: And with this knife I'll help it presently.
56: God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
57: And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
58: Shall be the label to another deed,
59: Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
60: Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
61: Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
62: Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
63: 'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
64: Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
65: Which the commission of thy years and art
66: Could to no issue of true honour bring.
67: Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
68: If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
69: FRIAR LAURENCE: Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
70: Which craves as desperate an execution.
71: As that is desperate which we would prevent.
72: If, rather than to marry County Paris,
73: Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
74: Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
75: A thing like death to chide away this shame,
76: That copest with death himself to scape from it:
77: And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
78: JULIET: O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
79: From off the battlements of yonder tower;
80: Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
81: Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
82: Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
83: O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
84: With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
85: Or bid me go into a new-made grave
86: And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
87: Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
88: And I will do it without fear or doubt,
89: To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
90: FRIAR LAURENCE: Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
91: To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
92: To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
93: Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
94: Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
95: And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
96: When presently through all thy veins shall run
97: A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
98: Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
99: No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
100: The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
101: To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
102: Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
103: Each part, deprived of supple government,
104: Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
105: And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
106: Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
107: And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
108: Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
109: To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
110: Then, as the manner of our country is,
111: In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
112: Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
113: Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
114: In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
115: Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
116: And hither shall he come: and he and I
117: Will watch thy waking, and that very night
118: Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
119: And this shall free thee from this present shame;
120: If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
121: Abate thy valour in the acting it.
122: JULIET: Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
123: FRIAR LAURENCE: Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
124: In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
125: To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
126: JULIET: Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
127: Farewell, dear father!
ACT 4 SCENE 2

1: CAPULET: So many guests invite as here are writ.
2: Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
3: Second Servant: You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
4: can lick their fingers.
5: CAPULET: How canst thou try them so?
6: Second Servant: Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
7: own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
8: fingers goes not with me.
9: CAPULET: Go, be gone.
10: We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
11: What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
12: Nurse: Ay, forsooth.
13: CAPULET: Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
14: A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
15: Nurse: See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
16: CAPULET: How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
17: JULIET: Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
18: Of disobedient opposition
19: To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
20: By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
21: And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
22: Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
23: CAPULET: Send for the county; go tell him of this:
24: I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
25: JULIET: I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
26: And gave him what becomed love I might,
27: Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
28: CAPULET: Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
29: This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
30: Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
31: Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
32: Our whole city is much bound to him.
33: JULIET: Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
34: To help me sort such needful ornaments
35: As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
36: LADY CAPULET: No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
37: CAPULET: Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
38: LADY  CAPULET: We shall be short in our provision:
39: 'Tis now near night.
40: CAPULET: Tush, I will stir about,
41: And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
42: Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
43: I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
44: I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
45: They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
46: To County Paris, to prepare him up
47: Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
48: Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
ACT 4 SCENE 3

1: JULIET: Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
2: I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
3: For I have need of many orisons
4: To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
5: Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
6: LADY CAPULET: What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
7: JULIET: No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
8: As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
9: So please you, let me now be left alone,
10: And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
11: For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
12: In this so sudden business.
13: LADY CAPULET: Good night:
14: Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
15: JULIET: Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
16: I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
17: That almost freezes up the heat of life:
18: I'll call them back again to comfort me:
19: Nurse! What should she do here?
20: My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
21: Come, vial.
22: What if this mixture do not work at all?
23: Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
24: No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
25: What if it be a poison, which the friar
26: Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
27: Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
28: Because he married me before to Romeo?
29: I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
30: For he hath still been tried a holy man.
31: How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
32: I wake before the time that Romeo
33: Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
34: Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
35: To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
36: And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
37: Or, if I live, is it not very like,
38: The horrible conceit of death and night,
39: Together with the terror of the place,--
40: As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
41: Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
42: Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
43: Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
44: Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
45: At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
46: Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
47: So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
48: And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
49: That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
50: O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
51: Environed with all these hideous fears?
52: And madly play with my forefather's joints?
53: And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
54: And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
55: As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
56: O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
57: Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
58: Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
59: Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
ACT 4 SCENE 4

1: LADY CAPULET: Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
2: Nurse: They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
3: CAPULET: Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
4: The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
5: Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
6: Spare not for the cost.
7: Nurse: Go, you cot-quean, go,
8: Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
9: For this night's watching.
10: CAPULET: No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
11: All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
12: LADY CAPULET: Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
13: But I will watch you from such watching now.
14: CAPULET: A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
15: Now, fellow,
16: What's there?
17: First Servant: Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
18: CAPULET: Make haste, make haste.
19: Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
20: Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
21: Second Servant: I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
22: And never trouble Peter for the matter.
23: CAPULET: Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
24: Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
25: The county will be here with music straight,
26: For so he said he would: I hear him near.
27: Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
28: Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
29: I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
30: Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
31: Make haste, I say.
ACT 4 SCENE 5

1: Nurse: Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
2: Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
3: Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
4: What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
5: Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
6: The County Paris hath set up his rest,
7: That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
8: Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
9: I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
10: Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
11: He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
12: What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
13: I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
14: Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
15: O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
16: Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
17: LADY CAPULET: What noise is here?
18: Nurse: O lamentable day!
19: LADY CAPULET: What is the matter?
20: Nurse: Look, look! O heavy day!
21: LADY CAPULET: O me, O me! My child, my only life,
22: Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
23: Help, help! Call help.
24: CAPULET: For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
25: Nurse: She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!
26: LADY CAPULET: Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
27: CAPULET: Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
28: Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
29: Life and these lips have long been separated:
30: Death lies on her like an untimely frost
31: Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
32: Nurse: O lamentable day!
33: LADY CAPULET: O woful time!
34: CAPULET: Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
35: Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
36: FRIAR LAURENCE: Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
37: CAPULET: Ready to go, but never to return.
38: O son! the night before thy wedding-day
39: Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
40: Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
41: Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
42: My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
43: And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
44: PARIS: Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
45: And doth it give me such a sight as this?
46: LADY CAPULET: Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
47: Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
48: In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
49: But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
50: But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
51: And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
52: Nurse: O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
53: Most lamentable day, most woful day,
54: That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
55: O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
56: Never was seen so black a day as this:
57: O woful day, O woful day!
58: PARIS: Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
59: Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
60: By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
61: O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
62: CAPULET: Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
63: Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
64: To murder, murder our solemnity?
65: O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
66: Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
67: And with my child my joys are buried.
68: FRIAR LAURENCE: Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
69: In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
70: Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
71: And all the better is it for the maid:
72: Your part in her you could not keep from death,
73: But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
74: The most you sought was her promotion;
75: For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
76: And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
77: Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
78: O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
79: That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
80: She's not well married that lives married long;
81: But she's best married that dies married young.
82: Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
83: On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
84: In all her best array bear her to church:
85: For though fond nature bids us an lament,
86: Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
87: CAPULET: All things that we ordained festival,
88: Turn from their office to black funeral;
89: Our instruments to melancholy bells,
90: Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
91: Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
92: Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
93: And all things change them to the contrary.
94: FRIAR LAURENCE: Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
95: And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
96: To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
97: The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
98: Move them no more by crossing their high will.
99: First Musician: Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
100: Nurse: Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
101: For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
102: First Musician: Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
103: PETER: Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
104: ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
105: First Musician: Why 'Heart's ease?'
106: PETER: O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
107: heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
108: to comfort me.
109: First Musician: Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
110: PETER: You will not, then?
111: First Musician: No.
112: PETER: I will then give it you soundly.
113: First Musician: What will you give us?
114: PETER: No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
115: I will give you the minstrel.
116: First Musician: Then I will give you the serving-creature.
117: PETER: Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
118: your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
119: I'll fa you; do you note me?
120: First Musician: An you re us and fa us, you note us.
121: Second Musician: Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
122: PETER: Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
123: with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
124: me like men:
125: 'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
126: And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
127: Then music with her silver sound'--
128: why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
129: sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
130: Musician: Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
131: PETER: Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
132: Second Musician: I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
133: PETER: Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
134: Third Musician: Faith, I know not what to say.
135: PETER: O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
136: for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
137: because musicians have no gold for sounding:
138: 'Then music with her silver sound
139: With speedy help doth lend redress.'
140: First Musician: What a pestilent knave is this same!
ACT 5 SCENE 1

1: ROMEO: If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
2: My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
3: My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
4: And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
5: Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
6: I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
7: Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
8: to think!--
9: And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
10: That I revived, and was an emperor.
11: Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
12: When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
13: News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
14: Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
15: How doth my lady? Is my father well?
16: How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
17: For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
18: BALTHASAR: Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
19: Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
20: And her immortal part with angels lives.
21: I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
22: And presently took post to tell it you:
23: O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
24: Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
25: ROMEO: Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
26: Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
27: And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
28: BALTHASAR: I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
29: Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
30: Some misadventure.
31: ROMEO: Tush, thou art deceived:
32: Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
33: Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
34: BALTHASAR: No, my good lord.
35: ROMEO: No matter: get thee gone,
36: And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
37: Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
38: Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
39: To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
40: I do remember an apothecary,--
41: And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
42: In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
43: Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
44: Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
45: And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
46: An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
47: Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
48: A beggarly account of empty boxes,
49: Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
50: Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
51: Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
52: Noting this penury, to myself I said
53: 'An if a man did need a poison now,
54: Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
55: Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
56: O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
57: And this same needy man must sell it me.
58: As I remember, this should be the house.
59: Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
60: What, ho! apothecary!
61: Apothecary: Who calls so loud?
62: ROMEO: Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
63: Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
64: A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
65: As will disperse itself through all the veins
66: That the life-weary taker may fall dead
67: And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
68: As violently as hasty powder fired
69: Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
70: Apothecary: Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
71: Is death to any he that utters them.
72: ROMEO: Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
73: And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
74: Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
75: Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
76: The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
77: The world affords no law to make thee rich;
78: Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
79: Apothecary: My poverty, but not my will, consents.
80: ROMEO: I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
81: Apothecary: Put this in any liquid thing you will,
82: And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
83: Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
84: ROMEO: There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
85: Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
86: Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
87: I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
88: Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
89: Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
90: To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
ACT 5 SCENE 2

1: FRIAR JOHN: Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
2: FRIAR LAURENCE: This same should be the voice of Friar John.
3: Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
4: Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
5: FRIAR JOHN: Going to find a bare-foot brother out
6: One of our order, to associate me,
7: Here in this city visiting the sick,
8: And finding him, the searchers of the town,
9: Suspecting that we both were in a house
10: Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
11: Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
12: So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
13: FRIAR LAURENCE: Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
14: FRIAR JOHN: I could not send it,--here it is again,--
15: Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
16: So fearful were they of infection.
17: FRIAR LAURENCE: Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
18: The letter was not nice but full of charge
19: Of dear import, and the neglecting it
20: May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
21: Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
22: Unto my cell.
23: FRIAR JOHN: Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
24: FRIAR LAURENCE: Now must I to the monument alone;
25: Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
26: She will beshrew me much that Romeo
27: Hath had no notice of these accidents;
28: But I will write again to Mantua,
29: And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
30: Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
ACT 5 SCENE 3

1: PARIS: Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
2: Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
3: Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
4: Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
5: So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
6: Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
7: But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
8: As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
9: Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
10: PAGE: [Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
11: Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
12: PARIS: Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
13: O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
14: Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
15: Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
16: The obsequies that I for thee will keep
17: Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
18: The boy gives warning something doth approach.
19: What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
20: To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
21: What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
22: ROMEO: Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
23: Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
24: See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
25: Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
26: Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
27: And do not interrupt me in my course.
28: Why I descend into this bed of death,
29: Is partly to behold my lady's face;
30: But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
31: A precious ring, a ring that I must use
32: In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
33: But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
34: In what I further shall intend to do,
35: By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
36: And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
37: The time and my intents are savage-wild,
38: More fierce and more inexorable far
39: Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
40: BALTHASAR: I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
41: ROMEO: So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
42: Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
43: BALTHASAR: [Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
44: His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
45: ROMEO: Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
46: Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
47: Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
48: And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
49: PARIS: This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
50: That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
51: It is supposed, the fair creature died;
52: And here is come to do some villanous shame
53: To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
54: Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
55: Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
56: Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
57: Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
58: ROMEO: I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
59: Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
60: Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
61: Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
62: Put not another sin upon my head,
63: By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
64: By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
65: For I come hither arm'd against myself:
66: Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
67: A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
68: PARIS: I do defy thy conjurations,
69: And apprehend thee for a felon here.
70: ROMEO: Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
71: PAGE: O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
72: PARIS: O, I am slain!
73: If thou be merciful,
74: Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
75: ROMEO: In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
76: Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
77: What said my man, when my betossed soul
78: Did not attend him as we rode? I think
79: He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
80: Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
81: Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
82: To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
83: One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
84: I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
85: A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
86: For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
87: This vault a feasting presence full of light.
88: Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
89: How oft when men are at the point of death
90: Have they been merry! which their keepers call
91: A lightning before death: O, how may I
92: Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
93: Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
94: Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
95: Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
96: Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
97: And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
98: Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
99: O, what more favour can I do to thee,
100: Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
101: To sunder his that was thine enemy?
102: Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
103: Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
104: That unsubstantial death is amorous,
105: And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
106: Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
107: For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
108: And never from this palace of dim night
109: Depart again: here, here will I remain
110: With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
111: Will I set up my everlasting rest,
112: And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
113: From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
114: Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
115: The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
116: A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
117: Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
118: Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
119: The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
120: Here's to my love!
121: O true apothecary!
122: Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
123: FRIAR LAURENCE: Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
124: Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
125: BALTHASAR: Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
126: FRIAR LAURENCE: Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
127: What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
128: To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
129: It burneth in the Capel's monument.
130: BALTHASAR: It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
131: One that you love.
132: FRIAR LAURENCE: Who is it?
133: BALTHASAR: Romeo.
134: FRIAR LAURENCE: How long hath he been there?
135: BALTHASAR: Full half an hour.
136: FRIAR LAURENCE: Go with me to the vault.
137: BALTHASAR: I dare not, sir
138: My master knows not but I am gone hence;
139: And fearfully did menace me with death,
140: If I did stay to look on his intents.
141: FRIAR LAURENCE: Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
142: O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
143: BALTHASAR: As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
144: I dreamt my master and another fought,
145: And that my master slew him.
146: FRIAR LAURENCE: Romeo!
147: Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
148: The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
149: What mean these masterless and gory swords
150: To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
151: Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
152: And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
153: Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
154: The lady stirs.
155: JULIET: O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
156: I do remember well where I should be,
157: And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
158: FRIAR LAURENCE: I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
159: Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
160: A greater power than we can contradict
161: Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
162: Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
163: And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
164: Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
165: Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
166: Come, go, good Juliet,
167: I dare no longer stay.
168: JULIET: Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
169: What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
170: Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
171: O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
172: To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
173: Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
174: To make die with a restorative.
175: Thy lips are warm.
176: First Watchman: [Within] Lead, boy: which way?
177: JULIET: Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
178: This is thy sheath;
179: there rust, and let me die.
180: PAGE: This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
181: First Watchman: The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
182: Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
183: Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
184: And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
185: Who here hath lain these two days buried.
186: Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
187: Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
188: We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
189: But the true ground of all these piteous woes
190: We cannot without circumstance descry.
191: Second Watchman: Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
192: First Watchman: Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
193: Third Watchman: Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
194: We took this mattock and this spade from him,
195: As he was coming from this churchyard side.
196: First Watchman: A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
197: PRINCE: What misadventure is so early up,
198: That calls our person from our morning's rest?
199: CAPULET: What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
200: LADY CAPULET: The people in the street cry Romeo,
201: Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
202: With open outcry toward our monument.
203: PRINCE: What fear is this which startles in our ears?
204: First Watchman: Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
205: And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
206: Warm and new kill'd.
207: PRINCE: Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
208: First Watchman: Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
209: With instruments upon them, fit to open
210: These dead men's tombs.
211: CAPULET: O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
212: This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
213: Is empty on the back of Montague,--
214: And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
215: LADY CAPULET: O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
216: That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
217: PRINCE: Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
218: To see thy son and heir more early down.
219: MONTAGUE: Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
220: Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
221: What further woe conspires against mine age?
222: PRINCE: Look, and thou shalt see.
223: MONTAGUE: O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
224: To press before thy father to a grave?
225: PRINCE: Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
226: Till we can clear these ambiguities,
227: And know their spring, their head, their
228: true descent;
229: And then will I be general of your woes,
230: And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
231: And let mischance be slave to patience.
232: Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
233: FRIAR LAURENCE: I am the greatest, able to do least,
234: Yet most suspected, as the time and place
235: Doth make against me of this direful murder;
236: And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
237: Myself condemned and myself excused.
238: PRINCE: Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
239: FRIAR LAURENCE: I will be brief, for my short date of breath
240: Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
241: Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
242: And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
243: I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
244: Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
245: Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
246: For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
247: You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
248: Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
249: To County Paris: then comes she to me,
250: And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
251: To rid her from this second marriage,
252: Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
253: Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
254: A sleeping potion; which so took effect
255: As I intended, for it wrought on her
256: The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
257: That he should hither come as this dire night,
258: To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
259: Being the time the potion's force should cease.
260: But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
261: Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
262: Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
263: At the prefixed hour of her waking,
264: Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
265: Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
266: Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
267: But when I came, some minute ere the time
268: Of her awaking, here untimely lay
269: The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
270: She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
271: And bear this work of heaven with patience:
272: But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
273: And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
274: But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
275: All this I know; and to the marriage
276: Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
277: Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
278: Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
279: Unto the rigour of severest law.
280: PRINCE: We still have known thee for a holy man.
281: Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
282: BALTHASAR: I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
283: And then in post he came from Mantua
284: To this same place, to this same monument.
285: This letter he early bid me give his father,
286: And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
287: I departed not and left him there.
288: PRINCE: Give me the letter; I will look on it.
289: Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
290: Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
291: PAGE: He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
292: And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
293: Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
294: And by and by my master drew on him;
295: And then I ran away to call the watch.
296: PRINCE: This letter doth make good the friar's words,
297: Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
298: And here he writes that he did buy a poison
299: Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
300: Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
301: Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
302: See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
303: That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
304: And I for winking at your discords too
305: Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
306: CAPULET: O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
307: This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
308: Can I demand.
309: MONTAGUE: But I can give thee more:
310: For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
311: That while Verona by that name is known,
312: There shall no figure at such rate be set
313: As that of true and faithful Juliet.
314: CAPULET: As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
315: Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
