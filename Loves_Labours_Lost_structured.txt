ACT 1 SCENE 1

1: FERDINAND: Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
2: Live register'd upon our brazen tombs
3: And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
4: When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
5: The endeavor of this present breath may buy
6: That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
7: And make us heirs of all eternity.
8: Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,
9: That war against your own affections
10: And the huge army of the world's desires,--
11: Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
12: Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
13: Our court shall be a little Academe,
14: Still and contemplative in living art.
15: You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,
16: Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
17: My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
18: That are recorded in this schedule here:
19: Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
20: That his own hand may strike his honour down
21: That violates the smallest branch herein:
22: If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
23: Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.
24: LONGAVILLE: I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
25: The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:
26: Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits
27: Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.
28: DUMAIN: My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:
29: The grosser manner of these world's delights
30: He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
31: To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;
32: With all these living in philosophy.
33: BIRON: I can but say their protestation over;
34: So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
35: That is, to live and study here three years.
36: But there are other strict observances;
37: As, not to see a woman in that term,
38: Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
39: And one day in a week to touch no food
40: And but one meal on every day beside,
41: The which I hope is not enrolled there;
42: And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
43: And not be seen to wink of all the day--
44: When I was wont to think no harm all night
45: And make a dark night too of half the day--
46: Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
47: O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
48: Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!
49: FERDINAND: Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
50: BIRON: Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
51: I only swore to study with your grace
52: And stay here in your court for three years' space.
53: LONGAVILLE: You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.
54: BIRON: By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
55: What is the end of study? let me know.
56: FERDINAND: Why, that to know, which else we should not know.
57: BIRON: Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
58: FERDINAND: Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.
59: BIRON: Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
60: To know the thing I am forbid to know:
61: As thus,--to study where I well may dine,
62: When I to feast expressly am forbid;
63: Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
64: When mistresses from common sense are hid;
65: Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
66: Study to break it and not break my troth.
67: If study's gain be thus and this be so,
68: Study knows that which yet it doth not know:
69: Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.
70: FERDINAND: These be the stops that hinder study quite
71: And train our intellects to vain delight.
72: BIRON: Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,
73: Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:
74: As, painfully to pore upon a book
75: To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
76: Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
77: Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
78: So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
79: Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
80: Study me how to please the eye indeed
81: By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
82: Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
83: And give him light that it was blinded by.
84: Study is like the heaven's glorious sun
85: That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:
86: Small have continual plodders ever won
87: Save base authority from others' books
88: These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
89: That give a name to every fixed star
90: Have no more profit of their shining nights
91: Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
92: Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
93: And every godfather can give a name.
94: FERDINAND: How well he's read, to reason against reading!
95: DUMAIN: Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
96: LONGAVILLE: He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.
97: BIRON: The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.
98: DUMAIN: How follows that?
99: BIRON: Fit in his place and time.
100: DUMAIN: In reason nothing.
101: BIRON: Something then in rhyme.
102: FERDINAND: Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,
103: That bites the first-born infants of the spring.
104: BIRON: Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
105: Before the birds have any cause to sing?
106: Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
107: At Christmas I no more desire a rose
108: Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
109: But like of each thing that in season grows.
110: So you, to study now it is too late,
111: Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.
112: FERDINAND: Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.
113: BIRON: No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:
114: And though I have for barbarism spoke more
115: Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
116: Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
117: And bide the penance of each three years' day.
118: Give me the paper; let me read the same;
119: And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.
120: FERDINAND: How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!
121: BIRON: [Reads] 'Item, That no woman shall come within a
122: mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?
123: LONGAVILLE: Four days ago.
124: BIRON: Let's see the penalty.
125: 'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?
126: LONGAVILLE: Marry, that did I.
127: BIRON: Sweet lord, and why?
128: LONGAVILLE: To fright them hence with that dread penalty.
129: BIRON: A dangerous law against gentility!
130: 'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman
131: within the term of three years, he shall endure such
132: public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'
133: This article, my liege, yourself must break;
134: For well you know here comes in embassy
135: The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
136: A maid of grace and complete majesty--
137: About surrender up of Aquitaine
138: To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:
139: Therefore this article is made in vain,
140: Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.
141: FERDINAND: What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.
142: BIRON: So study evermore is overshot:
143: While it doth study to have what it would
144: It doth forget to do the thing it should,
145: And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
146: 'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.
147: FERDINAND: We must of force dispense with this decree;
148: She must lie here on mere necessity.
149: BIRON: Necessity will make us all forsworn
150: Three thousand times within this three years' space;
151: For every man with his affects is born,
152: Not by might master'd but by special grace:
153: If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;
154: I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'
155: So to the laws at large I write my name:
156: And he that breaks them in the least degree
157: Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
158: Suggestions are to other as to me;
159: But I believe, although I seem so loath,
160: I am the last that will last keep his oath.
161: But is there no quick recreation granted?
162: FERDINAND: Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
163: With a refined traveller of Spain;
164: A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
165: That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
166: One whom the music of his own vain tongue
167: Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
168: A man of complements, whom right and wrong
169: Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:
170: This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
171: For interim to our studies shall relate
172: In high-born words the worth of many a knight
173: From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
174: How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;
175: But, I protest, I love to hear him lie
176: And I will use him for my minstrelsy.
177: BIRON: Armado is a most illustrious wight,
178: A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.
179: LONGAVILLE: Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
180: And so to study, three years is but short.
181: DULL: Which is the duke's own person?
182: BIRON: This, fellow: what wouldst?
183: DULL: I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his
184: grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person
185: in flesh and blood.
186: BIRON: This is he.
187: DULL: Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villany
188: abroad: this letter will tell you more.
189: COSTARD: Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.
190: FERDINAND: A letter from the magnificent Armado.
191: BIRON: How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.
192: LONGAVILLE: A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!
193: BIRON: To hear? or forbear laughing?
194: LONGAVILLE: To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to
195: forbear both.
196: BIRON: Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to
197: climb in the merriness.
198: COSTARD: The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
199: The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.
200: BIRON: In what manner?
201: COSTARD: In manner and form following, sir; all those three:
202: I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with
203: her upon the form, and taken following her into the
204: park; which, put together, is in manner and form
205: following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the
206: manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--
207: in some form.
208: BIRON: For the following, sir?
209: COSTARD: As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend
210: the right!
211: FERDINAND: Will you hear this letter with attention?
212: BIRON: As we would hear an oracle.
213: COSTARD: Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.
214: FERDINAND: [Reads] 'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and
215: sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,
216: and body's fostering patron.'
217: COSTARD: Not a word of Costard yet.
218: FERDINAND: [Reads] 'So it is,'--
219: COSTARD: It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in
220: telling true, but so.
221: FERDINAND: Peace!
222: COSTARD: Be to me and every man that dares not fight!
223: FERDINAND: No words!
224: COSTARD: Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.
225: FERDINAND: [Reads] 'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured
226: melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour
227: to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving
228: air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to
229: walk. The time when. About the sixth hour; when
230: beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down
231: to that nourishment which is called supper: so much
232: for the time when. Now for the ground which; which,
233: I mean, I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park. Then
234: for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter
235: that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth
236: from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which
237: here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest;
238: but to the place where; it standeth north-north-east
239: and by east from the west corner of thy curious-
240: knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited
241: swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,'--
242: COSTARD: Me?
243: FERDINAND: [Reads] 'that unlettered small-knowing soul,'--
244: COSTARD: Me?
245: FERDINAND: [Reads] 'that shallow vassal,'--
246: COSTARD: Still me?
247: FERDINAND: [Reads] 'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'--
248: COSTARD: O, me!
249: FERDINAND: [Reads] 'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy
250: established proclaimed edict and continent canon,
251: which with,--O, with--but with this I passion to say
252: wherewith,--
253: COSTARD: With a wench.
254: FERDINAND: [Reads] 'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a
255: female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a
256: woman. Him I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on,
257: have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
258: punishment, by thy sweet grace's officer, Anthony
259: Dull; a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and
260: estimation.'
261: DULL: 'Me, an't shall please you; I am Anthony Dull.
262: FERDINAND: [Reads] 'For Jaquenetta,--so is the weaker vessel
263: called which I apprehended with the aforesaid
264: swain,--I keep her as a vessel of the law's fury;
265: and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring
266: her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted
267: and heart-burning heat of duty.
268: DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
269: BIRON: This is not so well as I looked for, but the best
270: that ever I heard.
271: FERDINAND: Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say
272: you to this?
273: COSTARD: Sir, I confess the wench.
274: FERDINAND: Did you hear the proclamation?
275: COSTARD: I do confess much of the hearing it but little of
276: the marking of it.
277: FERDINAND: It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken
278: with a wench.
279: COSTARD: I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.
280: FERDINAND: Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'
281: COSTARD: This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.
282: FERDINAND: It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'
283: COSTARD: If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.
284: FERDINAND: This maid will not serve your turn, sir.
285: COSTARD: This maid will serve my turn, sir.
286: FERDINAND: Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast
287: a week with bran and water.
288: COSTARD: I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.
289: FERDINAND: And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
290: My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:
291: And go we, lords, to put in practise that
292: Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.
293: BIRON: I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
294: These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
295: Sirrah, come on.
296: COSTARD: I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I was
297: taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true
298: girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of
299: prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and
300: till then, sit thee down, sorrow!
301: LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
ACT 1 SCENE 2

1: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit
2: grows melancholy?
3: MOTH: A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
4: DON
5: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.
6: MOTH: No, no; O Lord, sir, no.
7: DON
8: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my
9: tender juvenal?
10: MOTH: By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.
11: DON
12: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Why tough senior? why tough senior?
13: MOTH: Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?
14: DON
15: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
16: appertaining to thy young days, which we may
17: nominate tender.
18: MOTH: And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your
19: old time, which we may name tough.
20: DON ADRIANO DE
21: ARMADO: Pretty and apt.
22: MOTH: How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or
23: I apt, and my saying pretty?
24: DON
25: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Thou pretty, because little.
26: MOTH: Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?
27: DON
28: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: And therefore apt, because quick.
29: MOTH: Speak you this in my praise, master?
30: DON
31: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: In thy condign praise.
32: MOTH: I will praise an eel with the same praise.
33: DON
34: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: What, that an eel is ingenious?
35: MOTH: That an eel is quick.
36: DON
37: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.
38: MOTH: I am answered, sir.
39: DON
40: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: I love not to be crossed.
41: MOTH: [Aside] He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.
42: DON
43: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: I have promised to study three years with the duke.
44: MOTH: You may do it in an hour, sir.
45: DON
46: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Impossible.
47: MOTH: How many is one thrice told?
48: DON
49: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.
50: MOTH: You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
51: DON
52: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: I confess both: they are both the varnish of a
53: complete man.
54: MOTH: Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of
55: deuce-ace amounts to.
56: DON
57: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: It doth amount to one more than two.
58: MOTH: Which the base vulgar do call three.
59: DON
60: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: True.
61: MOTH: Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here
62: is three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and how
63: easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' and
64: study three years in two words, the dancing horse
65: will tell you.
66: DON
67: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: A most fine figure!
68: MOTH: To prove you a cipher.
69: DON
70: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is
71: base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a
72: base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour
73: of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
74: thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
75: ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised
76: courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should
77: outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men
78: have been in love?
79: MOTH: Hercules, master.
80: DON
81: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name
82: more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good
83: repute and carriage.
84: MOTH: Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great
85: carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back
86: like a porter: and he was in love.
87: DON
88: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do
89: excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
90: carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's
91: love, my dear Moth?
92: MOTH: A woman, master.
93: DON
94: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Of what complexion?
95: MOTH: Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.
96: DON
97: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Tell me precisely of what complexion.
98: MOTH: Of the sea-water green, sir.
99: DON
100: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Is that one of the four complexions?
101: MOTH: As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.
102: DON
103: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a
104: love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason
105: for it. He surely affected her for her wit.
106: MOTH: It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
107: DON
108: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: My love is most immaculate white and red.
109: MOTH: Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under
110: such colours.
111: DON
112: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Define, define, well-educated infant.
113: MOTH: My father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!
114: DON
115: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and
116: pathetical!
117: MOTH: If she be made of white and red,
118: Her faults will ne'er be known,
119: For blushing cheeks by faults are bred
120: And fears by pale white shown:
121: Then if she fear, or be to blame,
122: By this you shall not know,
123: For still her cheeks possess the same
124: Which native she doth owe.
125: A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of
126: white and red.
127: DON
128: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?
129: MOTH: The world was very guilty of such a ballad some
130: three ages since: but I think now 'tis not to be
131: found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for
132: the writing nor the tune.
133: DON
134: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
135: example my digression by some mighty precedent.
136: Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the
137: park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.
138: MOTH: [Aside] To be whipped; and yet a better love than
139: my master.
140: DON
141: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.
142: MOTH: And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.
143: DON
144: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: I say, sing.
145: MOTH: Forbear till this company be past.
146: DULL: Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costard
147: safe: and you must suffer him to take no delight
148: nor no penance; but a' must fast three days a week.
149: For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she
150: is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.
151: DON
152: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!
153: JAQUENETTA: Man?
154: DON
155: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: I will visit thee at the lodge.
156: JAQUENETTA: That's hereby.
157: DON
158: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: I know where it is situate.
159: JAQUENETTA: Lord, how wise you are!
160: DON
161: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: I will tell thee wonders.
162: JAQUENETTA: With that face?
163: DON
164: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: I love thee.
165: JAQUENETTA: So I heard you say.
166: DON
167: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: And so, farewell.
168: JAQUENETTA: Fair weather after you!
169: DULL: Come, Jaquenetta, away!
170: DON
171: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou
172: be pardoned.
173: COSTARD: Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a
174: full stomach.
175: DON
176: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Thou shalt be heavily punished.
177: COSTARD: I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they
178: are but lightly rewarded.
179: DON
180: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Take away this villain; shut him up.
181: MOTH: Come, you transgressing slave; away!
182: COSTARD: Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.
183: MOTH: No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.
184: COSTARD: Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation
185: that I have seen, some shall see.
186: MOTH: What shall some see?
187: COSTARD: Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.
188: It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their
189: words; and therefore I will say nothing: I thank
190: God I have as little patience as another man; and
191: therefore I can be quiet.
192: DON
ACT 2 SCENE 1

1: BOYET: Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:
2: Consider who the king your father sends,
3: To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
4: Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
5: To parley with the sole inheritor
6: Of all perfections that a man may owe,
7: Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
8: Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
9: Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
10: As Nature was in making graces dear
11: When she did starve the general world beside
12: And prodigally gave them all to you.
13: PRINCESS: Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
14: Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
15: Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,
16: Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:
17: I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
18: Than you much willing to be counted wise
19: In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
20: But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
21: You are not ignorant, all-telling fame
22: Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
23: Till painful study shall outwear three years,
24: No woman may approach his silent court:
25: Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
26: Before we enter his forbidden gates,
27: To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
28: Bold of your worthiness, we single you
29: As our best-moving fair solicitor.
30: Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,
31: On serious business, craving quick dispatch,
32: Importunes personal conference with his grace:
33: Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
34: Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.
35: BOYET: Proud of employment, willingly I go.
36: PRINCESS: All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.
37: Who are the votaries, my loving lords,
38: That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?
39: First Lord: Lord Longaville is one.
40: PRINCESS: Know you the man?
41: MARIA: I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,
42: Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
43: Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
44: In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:
45: A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;
46: Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:
47: Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
48: The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
49: If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
50: Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;
51: Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
52: It should none spare that come within his power.
53: PRINCESS: Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?
54: MARIA: They say so most that most his humours know.
55: PRINCESS: Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.
56: Who are the rest?
57: KATHARINE: The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,
58: Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
59: Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;
60: For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
61: And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
62: I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;
63: And much too little of that good I saw
64: Is my report to his great worthiness.
65: ROSALINE: Another of these students at that time
66: Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
67: Biron they call him; but a merrier man,
68: Within the limit of becoming mirth,
69: I never spent an hour's talk withal:
70: His eye begets occasion for his wit;
71: For every object that the one doth catch
72: The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
73: Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
74: Delivers in such apt and gracious words
75: That aged ears play truant at his tales
76: And younger hearings are quite ravished;
77: So sweet and voluble is his discourse.
78: PRINCESS: God bless my ladies! are they all in love,
79: That every one her own hath garnished
80: With such bedecking ornaments of praise?
81: First Lord: Here comes Boyet.
82: PRINCESS: Now, what admittance, lord?
83: BOYET: Navarre had notice of your fair approach;
84: And he and his competitors in oath
85: Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,
86: Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:
87: He rather means to lodge you in the field,
88: Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
89: Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
90: To let you enter his unpeopled house.
91: Here comes Navarre.
92: FERDINAND: Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.
93: PRINCESS: 'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I have
94: not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be
95: yours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.
96: FERDINAND: You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.
97: PRINCESS: I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.
98: FERDINAND: Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
99: PRINCESS: Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.
100: FERDINAND: Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.
101: PRINCESS: Why, will shall break it; will and nothing else.
102: FERDINAND: Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.
103: PRINCESS: Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,
104: Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
105: I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:
106: Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
107: And sin to break it.
108: But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:
109: To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
110: Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,
111: And suddenly resolve me in my suit.
112: FERDINAND: Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.
113: PRINCESS: You will the sooner, that I were away;
114: For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.
115: BIRON: Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
116: ROSALINE: Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
117: BIRON: I know you did.
118: ROSALINE: How needless was it then to ask the question!
119: BIRON: You must not be so quick.
120: ROSALINE: 'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.
121: BIRON: Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.
122: ROSALINE: Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
123: BIRON: What time o' day?
124: ROSALINE: The hour that fools should ask.
125: BIRON: Now fair befall your mask!
126: ROSALINE: Fair fall the face it covers!
127: BIRON: And send you many lovers!
128: ROSALINE: Amen, so you be none.
129: BIRON: Nay, then will I be gone.
130: FERDINAND: Madam, your father here doth intimate
131: The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
132: Being but the one half of an entire sum
133: Disbursed by my father in his wars.
134: But say that he or we, as neither have,
135: Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
136: A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,
137: One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
138: Although not valued to the money's worth.
139: If then the king your father will restore
140: But that one half which is unsatisfied,
141: We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
142: And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
143: But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
144: For here he doth demand to have repaid
145: A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
146: On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
147: To have his title live in Aquitaine;
148: Which we much rather had depart withal
149: And have the money by our father lent
150: Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
151: Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
152: From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
153: A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
154: And go well satisfied to France again.
155: PRINCESS: You do the king my father too much wrong
156: And wrong the reputation of your name,
157: In so unseeming to confess receipt
158: Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
159: FERDINAND: I do protest I never heard of it;
160: And if you prove it, I'll repay it back
161: Or yield up Aquitaine.
162: PRINCESS: We arrest your word.
163: Boyet, you can produce acquittances
164: For such a sum from special officers
165: Of Charles his father.
166: FERDINAND: Satisfy me so.
167: BOYET: So please your grace, the packet is not come
168: Where that and other specialties are bound:
169: To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.
170: FERDINAND: It shall suffice me: at which interview
171: All liberal reason I will yield unto.
172: Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
173: As honour without breach of honour may
174: Make tender of to thy true worthiness:
175: You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;
176: But here without you shall be so received
177: As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,
178: Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
179: Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:
180: To-morrow shall we visit you again.
181: PRINCESS: Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!
182: FERDINAND: Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!
183: BIRON: Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.
184: ROSALINE: Pray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.
185: BIRON: I would you heard it groan.
186: ROSALINE: Is the fool sick?
187: BIRON: Sick at the heart.
188: ROSALINE: Alack, let it blood.
189: BIRON: Would that do it good?
190: ROSALINE: My physic says 'ay.'
191: BIRON: Will you prick't with your eye?
192: ROSALINE: No point, with my knife.
193: BIRON: Now, God save thy life!
194: ROSALINE: And yours from long living!
195: BIRON: I cannot stay thanksgiving.
196: DUMAIN: Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?
197: BOYET: The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.
198: DUMAIN: A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well.
199: LONGAVILLE: I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?
200: BOYET: A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.
201: LONGAVILLE: Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.
202: BOYET: She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.
203: LONGAVILLE: Pray you, sir, whose daughter?
204: BOYET: Her mother's, I have heard.
205: LONGAVILLE: God's blessing on your beard!
206: BOYET: Good sir, be not offended.
207: She is an heir of Falconbridge.
208: LONGAVILLE: Nay, my choler is ended.
209: She is a most sweet lady.
210: BOYET: Not unlike, sir, that may be.
211: BIRON: What's her name in the cap?
212: BOYET: Rosaline, by good hap.
213: BIRON: Is she wedded or no?
214: BOYET: To her will, sir, or so.
215: BIRON: You are welcome, sir: adieu.
216: BOYET: Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.
217: MARIA: That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord:
218: Not a word with him but a jest.
219: BOYET: And every jest but a word.
220: PRINCESS: It was well done of you to take him at his word.
221: BOYET: I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.
222: MARIA: Two hot sheeps, marry.
223: BOYET: And wherefore not ships?
224: No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.
225: MARIA: You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?
226: BOYET: So you grant pasture for me.
227: MARIA: Not so, gentle beast:
228: My lips are no common, though several they be.
229: BOYET: Belonging to whom?
230: MARIA: To my fortunes and me.
231: PRINCESS: Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree:
232: This civil war of wits were much better used
233: On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.
234: BOYET: If my observation, which very seldom lies,
235: By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,
236: Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.
237: PRINCESS: With what?
238: BOYET: With that which we lovers entitle affected.
239: PRINCESS: Your reason?
240: BOYET: Why, all his behaviors did make their retire
241: To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:
242: His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,
243: Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:
244: His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
245: Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
246: All senses to that sense did make their repair,
247: To feel only looking on fairest of fair:
248: Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
249: As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
250: Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,
251: Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:
252: His face's own margent did quote such amazes
253: That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
254: I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
255: An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.
256: PRINCESS: Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.
257: BOYET: But to speak that in words which his eye hath
258: disclosed.
259: I only have made a mouth of his eye,
260: By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.
261: ROSALINE: Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.
262: MARIA: He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.
263: ROSALINE: Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim.
264: BOYET: Do you hear, my mad wenches?
265: MARIA: No.
266: BOYET: What then, do you see?
267: ROSALINE: Ay, our way to be gone.
ACT 3 SCENE 1

1: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.
2: MOTH: Concolinel.
3: DON
4: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this key,
5: give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately
6: hither: I must employ him in a letter to my love.
7: MOTH: Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?
8: DON
9: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: How meanest thou? brawling in French?
10: MOTH: No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune at
11: the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour
12: it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and
13: sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you
14: swallowed love with singing love, sometime through
15: the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling
16: love; with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of
17: your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin-belly
18: doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in
19: your pocket like a man after the old painting; and
20: keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.
21: These are complements, these are humours; these
22: betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without
23: these; and make them men of note--do you note
24: me?--that most are affected to these.
25: DON
26: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: How hast thou purchased this experience?
27: MOTH: By my penny of observation.
28: DON
29: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: But O,--but O,--
30: MOTH: 'The hobby-horse is forgot.'
31: DON
32: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Callest thou my love 'hobby-horse'?
33: MOTH: No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your
34: love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?
35: DON
36: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Almost I had.
37: MOTH: Negligent student! learn her by heart.
38: DON
39: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: By heart and in heart, boy.
40: MOTH: And out of heart, master: all those three I will prove.
41: DON
42: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: What wilt thou prove?
43: MOTH: A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon
44: the instant: by heart you love her, because your
45: heart cannot come by her; in heart you love her,
46: because your heart is in love with her; and out of
47: heart you love her, being out of heart that you
48: cannot enjoy her.
49: DON
50: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: I am all these three.
51: MOTH: And three times as much more, and yet nothing at
52: all.
53: DON
54: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.
55: MOTH: A message well sympathized; a horse to be ambassador
56: for an ass.
57: DON
58: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Ha, ha! what sayest thou?
59: MOTH: Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse,
60: for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.
61: DON
62: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: The way is but short: away!
63: MOTH: As swift as lead, sir.
64: DON
65: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: The meaning, pretty ingenious?
66: Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?
67: MOTH: Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
68: DON
69: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: I say lead is slow.
70: MOTH: You are too swift, sir, to say so:
71: Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?
72: DON
73: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
74: He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he:
75: I shoot thee at the swain.
76: MOTH: Thump then and I flee.
77: DON
78: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: A most acute juvenal; voluble and free of grace!
79: By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face:
80: Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
81: My herald is return'd.
82: MOTH: A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.
83: DON
84: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l'envoy; begin.
85: COSTARD: No enigma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the
86: mail, sir: O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! no
87: l'envoy, no l'envoy; no salve, sir, but a plantain!
88: DON
89: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly
90: thought my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes
91: me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars!
92: Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy, and
93: the word l'envoy for a salve?
94: MOTH: Do the wise think them other? is not l'envoy a salve?
95: DON
96: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse, to make plain
97: Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
98: I will example it:
99: The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
100: Were still at odds, being but three.
101: There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.
102: MOTH: I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.
103: DON
104: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
105: Were still at odds, being but three.
106: MOTH: Until the goose came out of door,
107: And stay'd the odds by adding four.
108: Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with
109: my l'envoy.
110: The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
111: Were still at odds, being but three.
112: DON
113: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Until the goose came out of door,
114: Staying the odds by adding four.
115: MOTH: A good l'envoy, ending in the goose: would you
116: desire more?
117: COSTARD: The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
118: Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.
119: To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:
120: Let me see; a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.
121: DON
122: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
123: MOTH: By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
124: Then call'd you for the l'envoy.
125: COSTARD: True, and I for a plantain: thus came your
126: argument in;
127: Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;
128: And he ended the market.
129: DON
130: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?
131: MOTH: I will tell you sensibly.
132: COSTARD: Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that l'envoy:
133: I Costard, running out, that was safely within,
134: Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.
135: DON
136: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: We will talk no more of this matter.
137: COSTARD: Till there be more matter in the shin.
138: DON
139: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.
140: COSTARD: O, marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy,
141: some goose, in this.
142: DON
143: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
144: enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured,
145: restrained, captivated, bound.
146: COSTARD: True, true; and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.
147: DON
148: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and,
149: in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this:
150: bear this significant
151: to the country maid Jaquenetta:
152: there is remuneration; for the best ward of mine
153: honour is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.
154: MOTH: Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.
155: COSTARD: My sweet ounce of man's flesh! my incony Jew!
156: Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration!
157: O, that's the Latin word for three farthings: three
158: farthings--remuneration.--'What's the price of this
159: inkle?'--'One penny.'--'No, I'll give you a
160: remuneration:' why, it carries it. Remuneration!
161: why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will
162: never buy and sell out of this word.
163: BIRON: O, my good knave Costard! exceedingly well met.
164: COSTARD: Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man
165: buy for a remuneration?
166: BIRON: What is a remuneration?
167: COSTARD: Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.
168: BIRON: Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.
169: COSTARD: I thank your worship: God be wi' you!
170: BIRON: Stay, slave; I must employ thee:
171: As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,
172: Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.
173: COSTARD: When would you have it done, sir?
174: BIRON: This afternoon.
175: COSTARD: Well, I will do it, sir: fare you well.
176: BIRON: Thou knowest not what it is.
177: COSTARD: I shall know, sir, when I have done it.
178: BIRON: Why, villain, thou must know first.
179: COSTARD: I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.
180: BIRON: It must be done this afternoon.
181: Hark, slave, it is but this:
182: The princess comes to hunt here in the park,
183: And in her train there is a gentle lady;
184: When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
185: And Rosaline they call her: ask for her;
186: And to her white hand see thou do commend
187: This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.
188: COSTARD: Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration,
189: a'leven-pence farthing better: most sweet gardon! I
190: will do it sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!
ACT 4 SCENE 1

1: PRINCESS: Was that the king, that spurred his horse so hard
2: Against the steep uprising of the hill?
3: BOYET: I know not; but I think it was not he.
4: PRINCESS: Whoe'er a' was, a' show'd a mounting mind.
5: Well, lords, to-day we shall have our dispatch:
6: On Saturday we will return to France.
7: Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush
8: That we must stand and play the murderer in?
9: Forester: Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;
10: A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
11: PRINCESS: I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,
12: And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.
13: Forester: Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.
14: PRINCESS: What, what? first praise me and again say no?
15: O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!
16: Forester: Yes, madam, fair.
17: PRINCESS: Nay, never paint me now:
18: Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.
19: Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:
20: Fair payment for foul words is more than due.
21: Forester: Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.
22: PRINCESS: See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!
23: O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
24: A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
25: But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,
26: And shooting well is then accounted ill.
27: Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:
28: Not wounding, pity would not let me do't;
29: If wounding, then it was to show my skill,
30: That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.
31: And out of question so it is sometimes,
32: Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,
33: When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,
34: We bend to that the working of the heart;
35: As I for praise alone now seek to spill
36: The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.
37: BOYET: Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty
38: Only for praise sake, when they strive to be
39: Lords o'er their lords?
40: PRINCESS: Only for praise: and praise we may afford
41: To any lady that subdues a lord.
42: BOYET: Here comes a member of the commonwealth.
43: COSTARD: God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?
44: PRINCESS: Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads.
45: COSTARD: Which is the greatest lady, the highest?
46: PRINCESS: The thickest and the tallest.
47: COSTARD: The thickest and the tallest! it is so; truth is truth.
48: An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,
49: One o' these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit.
50: Are not you the chief woman? you are the thickest here.
51: PRINCESS: What's your will, sir? what's your will?
52: COSTARD: I have a letter from Monsieur Biron to one Lady Rosaline.
53: PRINCESS: O, thy letter, thy letter! he's a good friend of mine:
54: Stand aside, good bearer. Boyet, you can carve;
55: Break up this capon.
56: BOYET: I am bound to serve.
57: This letter is mistook, it importeth none here;
58: It is writ to Jaquenetta.
59: PRINCESS: We will read it, I swear.
60: Break the neck of the wax, and every one give ear.
61: BOYET: 'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible;
62: true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that
63: thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful
64: than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have
65: commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The
66: magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set
67: eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar
68: Zenelophon; and he it was that might rightly say,
69: Veni, vidi, vici; which to annothanize in the
70: vulgar,--O base and obscure vulgar!--videlicet, He
71: came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw two;
72: overcame, three. Who came? the king: why did he
73: come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to
74: whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the
75: beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The
76: conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's.
77: The captive is enriched: on whose side? the
78: beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose
79: side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in
80: both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:
81: thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness.
82: Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce
83: thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I
84: will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes;
85: for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus,
86: expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot,
87: my eyes on thy picture. and my heart on thy every
88: part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry,
89: DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
90: Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
91: 'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.
92: Submissive fall his princely feet before,
93: And he from forage will incline to play:
94: But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?
95: Food for his rage, repasture for his den.
96: PRINCESS: What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?
97: What vane? what weathercock? did you ever hear better?
98: BOYET: I am much deceived but I remember the style.
99: PRINCESS: Else your memory is bad, going o'er it erewhile.
100: BOYET: This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court;
101: A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
102: To the prince and his bookmates.
103: PRINCESS: Thou fellow, a word:
104: Who gave thee this letter?
105: COSTARD: I told you; my lord.
106: PRINCESS: To whom shouldst thou give it?
107: COSTARD: From my lord to my lady.
108: PRINCESS: From which lord to which lady?
109: COSTARD: From my lord Biron, a good master of mine,
110: To a lady of France that he call'd Rosaline.
111: PRINCESS: Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords, away.
112: Here, sweet, put up this: 'twill be thine another day.
113: BOYET: Who is the suitor? who is the suitor?
114: ROSALINE: Shall I teach you to know?
115: BOYET: Ay, my continent of beauty.
116: ROSALINE: Why, she that bears the bow.
117: Finely put off!
118: BOYET: My lady goes to kill horns; but, if thou marry,
119: Hang me by the neck, if horns that year miscarry.
120: Finely put on!
121: ROSALINE: Well, then, I am the shooter.
122: BOYET: And who is your deer?
123: ROSALINE: If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.
124: Finely put on, indeed!
125: MARIA: You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes
126: at the brow.
127: BOYET: But she herself is hit lower: have I hit her now?
128: ROSALINE: Shall I come upon thee with an old saying, that was
129: a man when King Pepin of France was a little boy, as
130: touching the hit it?
131: BOYET: So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a
132: woman when Queen Guinover of Britain was a little
133: wench, as touching the hit it.
134: ROSALINE: Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,
135: Thou canst not hit it, my good man.
136: BOYET: An I cannot, cannot, cannot,
137: An I cannot, another can.
138: COSTARD: By my troth, most pleasant: how both did fit it!
139: MARIA: A mark marvellous well shot, for they both did hit it.
140: BOYET: A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!
141: Let the mark have a prick in't, to mete at, if it may be.
142: MARIA: Wide o' the bow hand! i' faith, your hand is out.
143: COSTARD: Indeed, a' must shoot nearer, or he'll ne'er hit the clout.
144: BOYET: An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.
145: COSTARD: Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.
146: MARIA: Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul.
147: COSTARD: She's too hard for you at pricks, sir: challenge her to bowl.
148: BOYET: I fear too much rubbing. Good night, my good owl.
149: COSTARD: By my soul, a swain! a most simple clown!
150: Lord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him down!
151: O' my troth, most sweet jests! most incony
152: vulgar wit!
153: When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it
154: were, so fit.
155: Armado o' th' one side,--O, a most dainty man!
156: To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!
157: To see him kiss his hand! and how most sweetly a'
158: will swear!
159: And his page o' t' other side, that handful of wit!
160: Ah, heavens, it is a most pathetical nit!
161: Sola, sola!
162: LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
ACT 4 SCENE 2

1: SIR NATHANIEL: Very reverend sport, truly; and done in the testimony
2: of a good conscience.
3: HOLOFERNES: The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe
4: as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in
5: the ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin, the heaven;
6: and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra,
7: the soil, the land, the earth.
8: SIR NATHANIEL: Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly
9: varied, like a scholar at the least: but, sir, I
10: assure ye, it was a buck of the first head.
11: HOLOFERNES: Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.
12: DULL: 'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
13: HOLOFERNES: Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of
14: insinuation, as it were, in via, in way, of
15: explication; facere, as it were, replication, or
16: rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his
17: inclination, after his undressed, unpolished,
18: uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather,
19: unlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion, to
20: insert again my haud credo for a deer.
21: DULL: I said the deer was not a haud credo; twas a pricket.
22: HOLOFERNES: Twice-sod simplicity, his coctus!
23: O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!
24: SIR NATHANIEL: Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred
25: in a book; he hath not eat paper, as it were; he
26: hath not drunk ink: his intellect is not
27: replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible in
28: the duller parts:
29: And such barren plants are set before us, that we
30: thankful should be,
31: Which we of taste and feeling are, for those parts that
32: do fructify in us more than he.
33: For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,
34: So were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school:
35: But omne bene, say I; being of an old father's mind,
36: Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.
37: DULL: You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit
38: What was a month old at Cain's birth, that's not five
39: weeks old as yet?
40: HOLOFERNES: Dictynna, goodman Dull; Dictynna, goodman Dull.
41: DULL: What is Dictynna?
42: SIR NATHANIEL: A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.
43: HOLOFERNES: The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,
44: And raught not to five weeks when he came to
45: five-score.
46: The allusion holds in the exchange.
47: DULL: 'Tis true indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.
48: HOLOFERNES: God comfort thy capacity! I say, the allusion holds
49: in the exchange.
50: DULL: And I say, the pollusion holds in the exchange; for
51: the moon is never but a month old: and I say beside
52: that, 'twas a pricket that the princess killed.
53: HOLOFERNES: Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph
54: on the death of the deer? And, to humour the
55: ignorant, call I the deer the princess killed a pricket.
56: SIR NATHANIEL: Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge; so it shall
57: please you to abrogate scurrility.
58: HOLOFERNES: I will something affect the letter, for it argues facility.
59: The preyful princess pierced and prick'd a pretty
60: pleasing pricket;
61: Some say a sore; but not a sore, till now made
62: sore with shooting.
63: The dogs did yell: put L to sore, then sorel jumps
64: from thicket;
65: Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.
66: If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores
67: one sorel.
68: Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L.
69: SIR NATHANIEL: A rare talent!
70: DULL: [Aside] If a talent be a claw, look how he claws
71: him with a talent.
72: HOLOFERNES: This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a
73: foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures,
74: shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions,
75: revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of
76: memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and
77: delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the
78: gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am
79: thankful for it.
80: SIR NATHANIEL: Sir, I praise the Lord for you; and so may my
81: parishioners; for their sons are well tutored by
82: you, and their daughters profit very greatly under
83: you: you are a good member of the commonwealth.
84: HOLOFERNES: Mehercle, if their sons be ingenuous, they shall
85: want no instruction; if their daughters be capable,
86: I will put it to them: but vir sapit qui pauca
87: loquitur; a soul feminine saluteth us.
88: JAQUENETTA: God give you good morrow, master Parson.
89: HOLOFERNES: Master Parson, quasi pers-on. An if one should be
90: pierced, which is the one?
91: COSTARD: Marry, master schoolmaster, he that is likest to a hogshead.
92: HOLOFERNES: Piercing a hogshead! a good lustre of conceit in a
93: tuft of earth; fire enough for a flint, pearl enough
94: for a swine: 'tis pretty; it is well.
95: JAQUENETTA: Good master Parson, be so good as read me this
96: letter: it was given me by Costard, and sent me
97: from Don Armado: I beseech you, read it.
98: HOLOFERNES: Fauste, precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra
99: Ruminat,--and so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan! I
100: may speak of thee as the traveller doth of Venice;
101: Venetia, Venetia,
102: Chi non ti vede non ti pretia.
103: Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! who understandeth thee
104: not, loves thee not. Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa.
105: Under pardon, sir, what are the contents? or rather,
106: as Horace says in his--What, my soul, verses?
107: SIR NATHANIEL: Ay, sir, and very learned.
108: HOLOFERNES: Let me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse; lege, domine.
109: SIR NATHANIEL: [Reads]
110: If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?
111: Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd!
112: Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll faithful prove:
113: Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like
114: osiers bow'd.
115: Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes,
116: Where all those pleasures live that art would
117: comprehend:
118: If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;
119: Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,
120: All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
121: Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire:
122: Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,
123: Which not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.
124: Celestial as thou art, O, pardon, love, this wrong,
125: That sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.
126: HOLOFERNES: You find not the apostraphas, and so miss the
127: accent: let me supervise the canzonet. Here are
128: only numbers ratified; but, for the elegancy,
129: facility, and golden cadence of poesy, caret.
130: Ovidius Naso was the man: and why, indeed, Naso,
131: but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers of
132: fancy, the jerks of invention? Imitari is nothing:
133: so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper,
134: the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin,
135: was this directed to you?
136: JAQUENETTA: Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Biron, one of the strange
137: queen's lords.
138: HOLOFERNES: I will overglance the superscript: 'To the
139: snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady
140: Rosaline.' I will look again on the intellect of
141: the letter, for the nomination of the party writing
142: to the person written unto: 'Your ladyship's in all
143: desired employment, BIRON.' Sir Nathaniel, this
144: Biron is one of the votaries with the king; and here
145: he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger
146: queen's, which accidentally, or by the way of
147: progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my
148: sweet; deliver this paper into the royal hand of the
149: king: it may concern much. Stay not thy
150: compliment; I forgive thy duty; adieu.
151: JAQUENETTA: Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life!
152: COSTARD: Have with thee, my girl.
153: SIR NATHANIEL: Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very
154: religiously; and, as a certain father saith,--
155: HOLOFERNES: Sir tell me not of the father; I do fear colourable
156: colours. But to return to the verses: did they
157: please you, Sir Nathaniel?
158: SIR NATHANIEL: Marvellous well for the pen.
159: HOLOFERNES: I do dine to-day at the father's of a certain pupil
160: of mine; where, if, before repast, it shall please
161: you to gratify the table with a grace, I will, on my
162: privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid
163: child or pupil, undertake your ben venuto; where I
164: will prove those verses to be very unlearned,
165: neither savouring of poetry, wit, nor invention: I
166: beseech your society.
167: SIR NATHANIEL: And thank you too; for society, saith the text, is
168: the happiness of life.
169: HOLOFERNES: And, certes, the text most infallibly concludes it.
170: Sir, I do invite you too; you shall not
171: say me nay: pauca verba. Away! the gentles are at
172: their game, and we will to our recreation.
173: LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
ACT 4 SCENE 3

1: BIRON: The king he is hunting the deer; I am coursing
2: myself: they have pitched a toil; I am toiling in
3: a pitch,--pitch that defiles: defile! a foul
4: word. Well, set thee down, sorrow! for so they say
5: the fool said, and so say I, and I the fool: well
6: proved, wit! By the Lord, this love is as mad as
7: Ajax: it kills sheep; it kills me, I a sheep:
8: well proved again o' my side! I will not love: if
9: I do, hang me; i' faith, I will not. O, but her
10: eye,--by this light, but for her eye, I would not
11: love her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing
12: in the world but lie, and lie in my throat. By
13: heaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme
14: and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme,
15: and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my
16: sonnets already: the clown bore it, the fool sent
17: it, and the lady hath it: sweet clown, sweeter
18: fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not care
19: a pin, if the other three were in. Here comes one
20: with a paper: God give him grace to groan!
21: FERDINAND: Ay me!
22: BIRON: [Aside] Shot, by heaven! Proceed, sweet Cupid:
23: thou hast thumped him with thy bird-bolt under the
24: left pap. In faith, secrets!
25: FERDINAND: [Reads]
26: So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
27: To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,
28: As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote
29: The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows:
30: Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
31: Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
32: As doth thy face through tears of mine give light;
33: Thou shinest in every tear that I do weep:
34: No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
35: So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
36: Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
37: And they thy glory through my grief will show:
38: But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep
39: My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.
40: O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel,
41: No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.
42: How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper:
43: Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?
44: What, Longaville! and reading! listen, ear.
45: BIRON: Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear!
46: LONGAVILLE: Ay me, I am forsworn!
47: BIRON: Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers.
48: FERDINAND: In love, I hope: sweet fellowship in shame!
49: BIRON: One drunkard loves another of the name.
50: LONGAVILLE: Am I the first that have been perjured so?
51: BIRON: I could put thee in comfort. Not by two that I know:
52: Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,
53: The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.
54: LONGAVILLE: I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move:
55: O sweet Maria, empress of my love!
56: These numbers will I tear, and write in prose.
57: BIRON: O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:
58: Disfigure not his slop.
59: LONGAVILLE: This same shall go.
60: Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,
61: 'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,
62: Persuade my heart to this false perjury?
63: Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.
64: A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
65: Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:
66: My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;
67: Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.
68: Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
69: Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine,
70: Exhalest this vapour-vow; in thee it is:
71: If broken then, it is no fault of mine:
72: If by me broke, what fool is not so wise
73: To lose an oath to win a paradise?
74: BIRON: This is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity,
75: A green goose a goddess: pure, pure idolatry.
76: God amend us, God amend! we are much out o' the way.
77: LONGAVILLE: By whom shall I send this?--Company! stay.
78: BIRON: All hid, all hid; an old infant play.
79: Like a demigod here sit I in the sky.
80: And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'ereye.
81: More sacks to the mill! O heavens, I have my wish!
82: Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!
83: DUMAIN: O most divine Kate!
84: BIRON: O most profane coxcomb!
85: DUMAIN: By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye!
86: BIRON: By earth, she is not, corporal, there you lie.
87: DUMAIN: Her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted.
88: BIRON: An amber-colour'd raven was well noted.
89: DUMAIN: As upright as the cedar.
90: BIRON: Stoop, I say;
91: Her shoulder is with child.
92: DUMAIN: As fair as day.
93: BIRON: Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine.
94: DUMAIN: O that I had my wish!
95: LONGAVILLE: And I had mine!
96: FERDINAND: And I mine too, good Lord!
97: BIRON: Amen, so I had mine: is not that a good word?
98: DUMAIN: I would forget her; but a fever she
99: Reigns in my blood and will remember'd be.
100: BIRON: A fever in your blood! why, then incision
101: Would let her out in saucers: sweet misprision!
102: DUMAIN: Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.
103: BIRON: Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit.
104: DUMAIN: [Reads]
105: On a day--alack the day!--
106: Love, whose month is ever May,
107: Spied a blossom passing fair
108: Playing in the wanton air:
109: Through the velvet leaves the wind,
110: All unseen, can passage find;
111: That the lover, sick to death,
112: Wish himself the heaven's breath.
113: Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow;
114: Air, would I might triumph so!
115: But, alack, my hand is sworn
116: Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn;
117: Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,
118: Youth so apt to pluck a sweet!
119: Do not call it sin in me,
120: That I am forsworn for thee;
121: Thou for whom Jove would swear
122: Juno but an Ethiope were;
123: And deny himself for Jove,
124: Turning mortal for thy love.
125: This will I send, and something else more plain,
126: That shall express my true love's fasting pain.
127: O, would the king, Biron, and Longaville,
128: Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,
129: Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note;
130: For none offend where all alike do dote.
131: LONGAVILLE: [Advancing] Dumain, thy love is far from charity.
132: You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,
133: To be o'erheard and taken napping so.
134: FERDINAND: [Advancing] Come, sir, you blush; as his your case is such;
135: You chide at him, offending twice as much;
136: You do not love Maria; Longaville
137: Did never sonnet for her sake compile,
138: Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
139: His loving bosom to keep down his heart.
140: I have been closely shrouded in this bush
141: And mark'd you both and for you both did blush:
142: I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,
143: Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion:
144: Ay me! says one; O Jove! the other cries;
145: One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other's eyes:
146: You would for paradise break faith, and troth;
147: And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.
148: What will Biron say when that he shall hear
149: Faith so infringed, which such zeal did swear?
150: How will he scorn! how will he spend his wit!
151: How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!
152: For all the wealth that ever I did see,
153: I would not have him know so much by me.
154: BIRON: Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.
155: Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!
156: Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove
157: These worms for loving, that art most in love?
158: Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
159: There is no certain princess that appears;
160: You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;
161: Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!
162: But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,
163: All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
164: You found his mote; the king your mote did see;
165: But I a beam do find in each of three.
166: O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,
167: Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!
168: O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
169: To see a king transformed to a gnat!
170: To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
171: And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
172: And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
173: And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
174: Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?
175: And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?
176: And where my liege's? all about the breast:
177: A caudle, ho!
178: FERDINAND: Too bitter is thy jest.
179: Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?
180: BIRON: Not you to me, but I betray'd by you:
181: I, that am honest; I, that hold it sin
182: To break the vow I am engaged in;
183: I am betray'd, by keeping company
184: With men like men of inconstancy.
185: When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
186: Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time
187: In pruning me? When shall you hear that I
188: Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,
189: A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
190: A leg, a limb?
191: FERDINAND: Soft! whither away so fast?
192: A true man or a thief that gallops so?
193: BIRON: I post from love: good lover, let me go.
194: JAQUENETTA: God bless the king!
195: FERDINAND: What present hast thou there?
196: COSTARD: Some certain treason.
197: FERDINAND: What makes treason here?
198: COSTARD: Nay, it makes nothing, sir.
199: FERDINAND: If it mar nothing neither,
200: The treason and you go in peace away together.
201: JAQUENETTA: I beseech your grace, let this letter be read:
202: Our parson misdoubts it; 'twas treason, he said.
203: FERDINAND: Biron, read it over.
204: Where hadst thou it?
205: JAQUENETTA: Of Costard.
206: FERDINAND: Where hadst thou it?
207: COSTARD: Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.
208: FERDINAND: How now! what is in you? why dost thou tear it?
209: BIRON: A toy, my liege, a toy: your grace needs not fear it.
210: LONGAVILLE: It did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear it.
211: DUMAIN: It is Biron's writing, and here is his name.
212: BIRON: [To COSTARD] Ah, you whoreson loggerhead! you were
213: born to do me shame.
214: Guilty, my lord, guilty! I confess, I confess.
215: FERDINAND: What?
216: BIRON: That you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess:
217: He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,
218: Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.
219: O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more.
220: DUMAIN: Now the number is even.
221: BIRON: True, true; we are four.
222: Will these turtles be gone?
223: FERDINAND: Hence, sirs; away!
224: COSTARD: Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay.
225: BIRON: Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
226: As true we are as flesh and blood can be:
227: The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;
228: Young blood doth not obey an old decree:
229: We cannot cross the cause why we were born;
230: Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.
231: FERDINAND: What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?
232: BIRON: Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,
233: That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,
234: At the first opening of the gorgeous east,
235: Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
236: Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
237: What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
238: Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,
239: That is not blinded by her majesty?
240: FERDINAND: What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?
241: My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;
242: She an attending star, scarce seen a light.
243: BIRON: My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron:
244: O, but for my love, day would turn to night!
245: Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty
246: Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,
247: Where several worthies make one dignity,
248: Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.
249: Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--
250: Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not:
251: To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
252: She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
253: A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
254: Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:
255: Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,
256: And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:
257: O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.
258: FERDINAND: By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.
259: BIRON: Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
260: A wife of such wood were felicity.
261: O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
262: That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
263: If that she learn not of her eye to look:
264: No face is fair that is not full so black.
265: FERDINAND: O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,
266: The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;
267: And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.
268: BIRON: Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
269: O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,
270: It mourns that painting and usurping hair
271: Should ravish doters with a false aspect;
272: And therefore is she born to make black fair.
273: Her favour turns the fashion of the days,
274: For native blood is counted painting now;
275: And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,
276: Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.
277: DUMAIN: To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.
278: LONGAVILLE: And since her time are colliers counted bright.
279: FERDINAND: And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.
280: DUMAIN: Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.
281: BIRON: Your mistresses dare never come in rain,
282: For fear their colours should be wash'd away.
283: FERDINAND: 'Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,
284: I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day.
285: BIRON: I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.
286: FERDINAND: No devil will fright thee then so much as she.
287: DUMAIN: I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.
288: LONGAVILLE: Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.
289: BIRON: O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,
290: Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!
291: DUMAIN: O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies
292: The street should see as she walk'd overhead.
293: FERDINAND: But what of this? are we not all in love?
294: BIRON: Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.
295: FERDINAND: Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove
296: Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.
297: DUMAIN: Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.
298: LONGAVILLE: O, some authority how to proceed;
299: Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.
300: DUMAIN: Some salve for perjury.
301: BIRON: 'Tis more than need.
302: Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.
303: Consider what you first did swear unto,
304: To fast, to study, and to see no woman;
305: Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
306: Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;
307: And abstinence engenders maladies.
308: And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,
309: In that each of you have forsworn his book,
310: Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
311: For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
312: Have found the ground of study's excellence
313: Without the beauty of a woman's face?
314: Why, universal plodding poisons up
315: The nimble spirits in the arteries,
316: As motion and long-during action tires
317: The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
318: Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
319: You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
320: And study too, the causer of your vow;
321: For where is any author in the world
322: Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
323: Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
324: And where we are our learning likewise is:
325: Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
326: Do we not likewise see our learning there?
327: O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
328: And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
329: For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
330: In leaden contemplation have found out
331: Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
332: Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?
333: Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
334: And therefore, finding barren practisers,
335: Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:
336: But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
337: Lives not alone immured in the brain;
338: But, with the motion of all elements,
339: Courses as swift as thought in every power,
340: And gives to every power a double power,
341: Above their functions and their offices.
342: It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
343: A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
344: A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
345: When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:
346: Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
347: Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;
348: Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
349: For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
350: Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
351: Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
352: As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:
353: And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
354: Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
355: Never durst poet touch a pen to write
356: Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
357: O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
358: And plant in tyrants mild humility.
359: From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
360: They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
361: They are the books, the arts, the academes,
362: That show, contain and nourish all the world:
363: Else none at all in ought proves excellent.
364: Then fools you were these women to forswear,
365: Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
366: For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,
367: Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,
368: Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,
369: Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,
370: Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
371: Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
372: It is religion to be thus forsworn,
373: For charity itself fulfills the law,
374: And who can sever love from charity?
375: FERDINAND: Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!
376: BIRON: Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
377: Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
378: In conflict that you get the sun of them.
379: LONGAVILLE: Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:
380: Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?
381: FERDINAND: And win them too: therefore let us devise
382: Some entertainment for them in their tents.
383: BIRON: First, from the park let us conduct them thither;
384: Then homeward every man attach the hand
385: Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
386: We will with some strange pastime solace them,
387: Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
388: For revels, dances, masks and merry hours
389: Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.
390: FERDINAND: Away, away! no time shall be omitted
391: That will betime, and may by us be fitted.
ACT 5 SCENE 1

1: HOLOFERNES: Satis quod sufficit.
2: SIR NATHANIEL: I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at dinner
3: have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without
4: scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without
5: impudency, learned without opinion, and strange with-
6: out heresy. I did converse this quondam day with
7: a companion of the king's, who is intituled, nomi-
8: nated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.
9: HOLOFERNES: Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty, his
10: discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye
11: ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general
12: behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is
13: too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it
14: were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.
15: SIR NATHANIEL: A most singular and choice epithet.
16: HOLOFERNES: He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer
17: than the staple of his argument. I abhor such
18: fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and
19: point-devise companions; such rackers of
20: orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should
21: say doubt; det, when he should pronounce debt,--d,
22: e, b, t, not d, e, t: he clepeth a calf, cauf;
23: half, hauf; neighbour vocatur nebor; neigh
24: abbreviated ne. This is abhominable,--which he
25: would call abbominable: it insinuateth me of
26: insanie: anne intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic.
27: SIR NATHANIEL: Laus Deo, bene intelligo.
28: HOLOFERNES: Bon, bon, fort bon, Priscian! a little scratch'd,
29: 'twill serve.
30: SIR NATHANIEL: Videsne quis venit?
31: HOLOFERNES: Video, et gaudeo.
32: DON
33: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Chirrah!
34: HOLOFERNES: Quare chirrah, not sirrah?
35: DON
36: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Men of peace, well encountered.
37: HOLOFERNES: Most military sir, salutation.
38: MOTH: [Aside to COSTARD] They have been at a great feast
39: of languages, and stolen the scraps.
40: COSTARD: O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of words.
41: I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word;
42: for thou art not so long by the head as
43: honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier
44: swallowed than a flap-dragon.
45: MOTH: Peace! the peal begins.
46: DON
47: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: [To HOLOFERNES] Monsieur, are you not lettered?
48: MOTH: Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a,
49: b, spelt backward, with the horn on his head?
50: HOLOFERNES: Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.
51: MOTH: Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.
52: HOLOFERNES: Quis, quis, thou consonant?
53: MOTH: The third of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or
54: the fifth, if I.
55: HOLOFERNES: I will repeat them,--a, e, i,--
56: MOTH: The sheep: the other two concludes it,--o, u.
57: DON
58: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet
59: touch, a quick venue of wit! snip, snap, quick and
60: home! it rejoiceth my intellect: true wit!
61: MOTH: Offered by a child to an old man; which is wit-old.
62: HOLOFERNES: What is the figure? what is the figure?
63: MOTH: Horns.
64: HOLOFERNES: Thou disputest like an infant: go, whip thy gig.
65: MOTH: Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about
66: your infamy circum circa,--a gig of a cuckold's horn.
67: COSTARD: An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst
68: have it to buy gingerbread: hold, there is the very
69: remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny
70: purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an
71: the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my
72: bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me!
73: Go to; thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers'
74: ends, as they say.
75: HOLOFERNES: O, I smell false Latin; dunghill for unguem.
76: DON
77: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Arts-man, preambulate, we will be singled from the
78: barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the
79: charge-house on the top of the mountain?
80: HOLOFERNES: Or mons, the hill.
81: DON
82: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.
83: HOLOFERNES: I do, sans question.
84: DON
85: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Sir, it is the king's most sweet pleasure and
86: affection to congratulate the princess at her
87: pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the
88: rude multitude call the afternoon.
89: HOLOFERNES: The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is
90: liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon:
91: the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do
92: assure you, sir, I do assure.
93: DON
94: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar,
95: I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is
96: inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,
97: remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy
98: head: and among other important and most serious
99: designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let
100: that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his
101: grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor
102: shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally
103: with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet
104: heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no
105: fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his
106: greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of
107: travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.
108: The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do
109: implore secrecy,--that the king would have me
110: present the princess, sweet chuck, with some
111: delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or
112: antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the
113: curate and your sweet self are good at such
114: eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it
115: were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to
116: crave your assistance.
117: HOLOFERNES: Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.
118: Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, some
119: show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by
120: our assistants, at the king's command, and this most
121: gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before
122: the princess; I say none so fit as to present the
123: Nine Worthies.
124: SIR NATHANIEL: Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?
125: HOLOFERNES: Joshua, yourself; myself and this gallant gentleman,
126: Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great
127: limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the
128: page, Hercules,--
129: DON
130: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for
131: that Worthy's thumb: he is not so big as the end of his club.
132: HOLOFERNES: Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules in
133: minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a
134: snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.
135: MOTH: An excellent device! so, if any of the audience
136: hiss, you may cry 'Well done, Hercules! now thou
137: crushest the snake!' that is the way to make an
138: offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.
139: DON
140: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: For the rest of the Worthies?--
141: HOLOFERNES: I will play three myself.
142: MOTH: Thrice-worthy gentleman!
143: DON
144: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Shall I tell you a thing?
145: HOLOFERNES: We attend.
146: DON
147: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: We will have, if this fadge not, an antique. I
148: beseech you, follow.
149: HOLOFERNES: Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while.
150: DULL: Nor understood none neither, sir.
151: HOLOFERNES: Allons! we will employ thee.
152: DULL: I'll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play
153: On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.
154: HOLOFERNES: Most dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away!
155: LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
ACT 5 SCENE 2

1: PRINCESS: Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
2: If fairings come thus plentifully in:
3: A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
4: Look you what I have from the loving king.
5: ROSALINE: Madame, came nothing else along with that?
6: PRINCESS: Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
7: As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,
8: Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,
9: That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.
10: ROSALINE: That was the way to make his godhead wax,
11: For he hath been five thousand years a boy.
12: KATHARINE: Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.
13: ROSALINE: You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.
14: KATHARINE: He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
15: And so she died: had she been light, like you,
16: Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,
17: She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:
18: And so may you; for a light heart lives long.
19: ROSALINE: What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
20: KATHARINE: A light condition in a beauty dark.
21: ROSALINE: We need more light to find your meaning out.
22: KATHARINE: You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
23: Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.
24: ROSALINE: Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.
25: KATHARINE: So do not you, for you are a light wench.
26: ROSALINE: Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.
27: KATHARINE: You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.
28: ROSALINE: Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'
29: PRINCESS: Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
30: But Rosaline, you have a favour too:
31: Who sent it? and what is it?
32: ROSALINE: I would you knew:
33: An if my face were but as fair as yours,
34: My favour were as great; be witness this.
35: Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:
36: The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,
37: I were the fairest goddess on the ground:
38: I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.
39: O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!
40: PRINCESS: Any thing like?
41: ROSALINE: Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.
42: PRINCESS: Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.
43: KATHARINE: Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
44: ROSALINE: 'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,
45: My red dominical, my golden letter:
46: O, that your face were not so full of O's!
47: KATHARINE: A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.
48: PRINCESS: But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?
49: KATHARINE: Madam, this glove.
50: PRINCESS: Did he not send you twain?
51: KATHARINE: Yes, madam, and moreover
52: Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,
53: A huge translation of hypocrisy,
54: Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.
55: MARIA: This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:
56: The letter is too long by half a mile.
57: PRINCESS: I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
58: The chain were longer and the letter short?
59: MARIA: Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
60: PRINCESS: We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
61: ROSALINE: They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
62: That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:
63: O that I knew he were but in by the week!
64: How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
65: And wait the season and observe the times
66: And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
67: And shape his service wholly to my hests
68: And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
69: So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
70: That he should be my fool and I his fate.
71: PRINCESS: None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,
72: As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,
73: Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
74: And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.
75: ROSALINE: The blood of youth burns not with such excess
76: As gravity's revolt to wantonness.
77: MARIA: Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
78: As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;
79: Since all the power thereof it doth apply
80: To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.
81: PRINCESS: Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.
82: BOYET: O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?
83: PRINCESS: Thy news Boyet?
84: BOYET: Prepare, madam, prepare!
85: Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are
86: Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,
87: Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:
88: Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
89: Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.
90: PRINCESS: Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they
91: That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.
92: BOYET: Under the cool shade of a sycamore
93: I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
94: When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,
95: Toward that shade I might behold addrest
96: The king and his companions: warily
97: I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
98: And overheard what you shall overhear,
99: That, by and by, disguised they will be here.
100: Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
101: That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:
102: Action and accent did they teach him there;
103: 'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'
104: And ever and anon they made a doubt
105: Presence majestical would put him out,
106: 'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;
107: Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
108: The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;
109: I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
110: With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,
111: Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:
112: One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore
113: A better speech was never spoke before;
114: Another, with his finger and his thumb,
115: Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'
116: The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'
117: The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.
118: With that, they all did tumble on the ground,
119: With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
120: That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
121: To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.
122: PRINCESS: But what, but what, come they to visit us?
123: BOYET: They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.
124: Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
125: Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;
126: And every one his love-feat will advance
127: Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
128: By favours several which they did bestow.
129: PRINCESS: And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;
130: For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;
131: And not a man of them shall have the grace,
132: Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
133: Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,
134: And then the king will court thee for his dear;
135: Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
136: So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.
137: And change your favours too; so shall your loves
138: Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.
139: ROSALINE: Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.
140: KATHARINE: But in this changing what is your intent?
141: PRINCESS: The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:
142: They do it but in mocking merriment;
143: And mock for mock is only my intent.
144: Their several counsels they unbosom shall
145: To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal
146: Upon the next occasion that we meet,
147: With visages displayed, to talk and greet.
148: ROSALINE: But shall we dance, if they desire to't?
149: PRINCESS: No, to the death, we will not move a foot;
150: Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,
151: But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.
152: BOYET: Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
153: And quite divorce his memory from his part.
154: PRINCESS: Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
155: The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out
156: There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,
157: To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:
158: So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
159: And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.
160: BOYET: The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.
161: MOTH: All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!--
162: BOYET: Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.
163: MOTH: A holy parcel of the fairest dames.
164: That ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views!
165: BIRON: [Aside to MOTH] Their eyes, villain, their eyes!
166: MOTH: That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!--Out--
167: BOYET: True; out indeed.
168: MOTH: Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe
169: Not to behold--
170: BIRON: [Aside to MOTH] Once to behold, rogue.
171: MOTH: Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,
172: --with your sun-beamed eyes--
173: BOYET: They will not answer to that epithet;
174: You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'
175: MOTH: They do not mark me, and that brings me out.
176: BIRON: Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!
177: ROSALINE: What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:
178: If they do speak our language, 'tis our will:
179: That some plain man recount their purposes
180: Know what they would.
181: BOYET: What would you with the princess?
182: BIRON: Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
183: ROSALINE: What would they, say they?
184: BOYET: Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
185: ROSALINE: Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.
186: BOYET: She says, you have it, and you may be gone.
187: FERDINAND: Say to her, we have measured many miles
188: To tread a measure with her on this grass.
189: BOYET: They say, that they have measured many a mile
190: To tread a measure with you on this grass.
191: ROSALINE: It is not so. Ask them how many inches
192: Is in one mile: if they have measured many,
193: The measure then of one is easily told.
194: BOYET: If to come hither you have measured miles,
195: And many miles, the princess bids you tell
196: How many inches doth fill up one mile.
197: BIRON: Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.
198: BOYET: She hears herself.
199: ROSALINE: How many weary steps,
200: Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,
201: Are number'd in the travel of one mile?
202: BIRON: We number nothing that we spend for you:
203: Our duty is so rich, so infinite,
204: That we may do it still without accompt.
205: Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,
206: That we, like savages, may worship it.
207: ROSALINE: My face is but a moon, and clouded too.
208: FERDINAND: Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!
209: Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,
210: Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.
211: ROSALINE: O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
212: Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.
213: FERDINAND: Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
214: Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.
215: ROSALINE: Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.
216: Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
217: FERDINAND: Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
218: ROSALINE: You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.
219: FERDINAND: Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.
220: The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.
221: ROSALINE: Our ears vouchsafe it.
222: FERDINAND: But your legs should do it.
223: ROSALINE: Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
224: We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.
225: FERDINAND: Why take we hands, then?
226: ROSALINE: Only to part friends:
227: Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.
228: FERDINAND: More measure of this measure; be not nice.
229: ROSALINE: We can afford no more at such a price.
230: FERDINAND: Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?
231: ROSALINE: Your absence only.
232: FERDINAND: That can never be.
233: ROSALINE: Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;
234: Twice to your visor, and half once to you.
235: FERDINAND: If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.
236: ROSALINE: In private, then.
237: FERDINAND: I am best pleased with that.
238: BIRON: White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.
239: PRINCESS: Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.
240: BIRON: Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
241: Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!
242: There's half-a-dozen sweets.
243: PRINCESS: Seventh sweet, adieu:
244: Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.
245: BIRON: One word in secret.
246: PRINCESS: Let it not be sweet.
247: BIRON: Thou grievest my gall.
248: PRINCESS: Gall! bitter.
249: BIRON: Therefore meet.
250: DUMAIN: Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?
251: MARIA: Name it.
252: DUMAIN: Fair lady,--
253: MARIA: Say you so? Fair lord,--
254: Take that for your fair lady.
255: DUMAIN: Please it you,
256: As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.
257: KATHARINE: What, was your vizard made without a tongue?
258: LONGAVILLE: I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
259: KATHARINE: O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.
260: LONGAVILLE: You have a double tongue within your mask,
261: And would afford my speechless vizard half.
262: KATHARINE: Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
263: LONGAVILLE: A calf, fair lady!
264: KATHARINE: No, a fair lord calf.
265: LONGAVILLE: Let's part the word.
266: KATHARINE: No, I'll not be your half
267: Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
268: LONGAVILLE: Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
269: Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so.
270: KATHARINE: Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.
271: LONGAVILLE: One word in private with you, ere I die.
272: KATHARINE: Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.
273: BOYET: The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
274: As is the razor's edge invisible,
275: Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
276: Above the sense of sense; so sensible
277: Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings
278: Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.
279: ROSALINE: Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.
280: BIRON: By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!
281: FERDINAND: Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.
282: PRINCESS: Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.
283: Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?
284: BOYET: Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.
285: ROSALINE: Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.
286: PRINCESS: O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
287: Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?
288: Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?
289: This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.
290: ROSALINE: O, they were all in lamentable cases!
291: The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.
292: PRINCESS: Biron did swear himself out of all suit.
293: MARIA: Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
294: No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.
295: KATHARINE: Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart;
296: And trow you what he called me?
297: PRINCESS: Qualm, perhaps.
298: KATHARINE: Yes, in good faith.
299: PRINCESS: Go, sickness as thou art!
300: ROSALINE: Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
301: But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.
302: PRINCESS: And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.
303: KATHARINE: And Longaville was for my service born.
304: MARIA: Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.
305: BOYET: Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
306: Immediately they will again be here
307: In their own shapes; for it can never be
308: They will digest this harsh indignity.
309: PRINCESS: Will they return?
310: BOYET: They will, they will, God knows,
311: And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:
312: Therefore change favours; and, when they repair,
313: Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.
314: PRINCESS: How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.
315: BOYET: Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
316: Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
317: Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.
318: PRINCESS: Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do,
319: If they return in their own shapes to woo?
320: ROSALINE: Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,
321: Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
322: Let us complain to them what fools were here,
323: Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;
324: And wonder what they were and to what end
325: Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd
326: And their rough carriage so ridiculous,
327: Should be presented at our tent to us.
328: BOYET: Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.
329: PRINCESS: Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.
330: FERDINAND: Fair sir, God save you! Where's the princess?
331: BOYET: Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty
332: Command me any service to her thither?
333: FERDINAND: That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.
334: BOYET: I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.
335: BIRON: This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
336: And utters it again when God doth please:
337: He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares
338: At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;
339: And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
340: Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
341: This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;
342: Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;
343: A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he
344: That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;
345: This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,
346: That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
347: In honourable terms: nay, he can sing
348: A mean most meanly; and in ushering
349: Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;
350: The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:
351: This is the flower that smiles on every one,
352: To show his teeth as white as whale's bone;
353: And consciences, that will not die in debt,
354: Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.
355: FERDINAND: A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,
356: That put Armado's page out of his part!
357: BIRON: See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thou
358: Till this madman show'd thee? and what art thou now?
359: FERDINAND: All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!
360: PRINCESS: 'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.
361: FERDINAND: Construe my speeches better, if you may.
362: PRINCESS: Then wish me better; I will give you leave.
363: FERDINAND: We came to visit you, and purpose now
364: To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.
365: PRINCESS: This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:
366: Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.
367: FERDINAND: Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
368: The virtue of your eye must break my oath.
369: PRINCESS: You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
370: For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
371: Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
372: As the unsullied lily, I protest,
373: A world of torments though I should endure,
374: I would not yield to be your house's guest;
375: So much I hate a breaking cause to be
376: Of heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity.
377: FERDINAND: O, you have lived in desolation here,
378: Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.
379: PRINCESS: Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
380: We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:
381: A mess of Russians left us but of late.
382: FERDINAND: How, madam! Russians!
383: PRINCESS: Ay, in truth, my lord;
384: Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.
385: ROSALINE: Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:
386: My lady, to the manner of the days,
387: In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
388: We four indeed confronted were with four
389: In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,
390: And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,
391: They did not bless us with one happy word.
392: I dare not call them fools; but this I think,
393: When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.
394: BIRON: This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
395: Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,
396: With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,
397: By light we lose light: your capacity
398: Is of that nature that to your huge store
399: Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.
400: ROSALINE: This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--
401: BIRON: I am a fool, and full of poverty.
402: ROSALINE: But that you take what doth to you belong,
403: It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.
404: BIRON: O, I am yours, and all that I possess!
405: ROSALINE: All the fool mine?
406: BIRON: I cannot give you less.
407: ROSALINE: Which of the vizards was it that you wore?
408: BIRON: Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?
409: ROSALINE: There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
410: That hid the worse and show'd the better face.
411: FERDINAND: We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.
412: DUMAIN: Let us confess and turn it to a jest.
413: PRINCESS: Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?
414: ROSALINE: Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
415: Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.
416: BIRON: Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
417: Can any face of brass hold longer out?
418: Here stand I: lady, dart thy skill at me;
419: Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;
420: Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;
421: Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
422: And I will wish thee never more to dance,
423: Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
424: O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,
425: Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
426: Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
427: Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
428: Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
429: Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,
430: Figures pedantical; these summer-flies
431: Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:
432: I do forswear them; and I here protest,
433: By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--
434: Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
435: In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
436: And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--
437: My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.
438: ROSALINE: Sans sans, I pray you.
439: BIRON: Yet I have a trick
440: Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
441: I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:
442: Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;
443: They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
444: They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;
445: These lords are visited; you are not free,
446: For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.
447: PRINCESS: No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.
448: BIRON: Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.
449: ROSALINE: It is not so; for how can this be true,
450: That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?
451: BIRON: Peace! for I will not have to do with you.
452: ROSALINE: Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
453: BIRON: Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.
454: FERDINAND: Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
455: Some fair excuse.
456: PRINCESS: The fairest is confession.
457: Were not you here but even now disguised?
458: FERDINAND: Madam, I was.
459: PRINCESS: And were you well advised?
460: FERDINAND: I was, fair madam.
461: PRINCESS: When you then were here,
462: What did you whisper in your lady's ear?
463: FERDINAND: That more than all the world I did respect her.
464: PRINCESS: When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.
465: FERDINAND: Upon mine honour, no.
466: PRINCESS: Peace, peace! forbear:
467: Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.
468: FERDINAND: Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.
469: PRINCESS: I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
470: What did the Russian whisper in your ear?
471: ROSALINE: Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
472: As precious eyesight, and did value me
473: Above this world; adding thereto moreover
474: That he would wed me, or else die my lover.
475: PRINCESS: God give thee joy of him! the noble lord
476: Most honourably doth unhold his word.
477: FERDINAND: What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,
478: I never swore this lady such an oath.
479: ROSALINE: By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,
480: You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.
481: FERDINAND: My faith and this the princess I did give:
482: I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.
483: PRINCESS: Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
484: And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.
485: What, will you have me, or your pearl again?
486: BIRON: Neither of either; I remit both twain.
487: I see the trick on't: here was a consent,
488: Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
489: To dash it like a Christmas comedy:
490: Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
491: Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
492: That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
493: To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,
494: Told our intents before; which once disclosed,
495: The ladies did change favours: and then we,
496: Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.
497: Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
498: We are again forsworn, in will and error.
499: Much upon this it is: and might not you
500: Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
501: Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,
502: And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
503: And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
504: Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?
505: You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;
506: Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
507: You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye
508: Wounds like a leaden sword.
509: BOYET: Full merrily
510: Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.
511: BIRON: Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.
512: Welcome, pure wit! thou partest a fair fray.
513: COSTARD: O Lord, sir, they would know
514: Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.
515: BIRON: What, are there but three?
516: COSTARD: No, sir; but it is vara fine,
517: For every one pursents three.
518: BIRON: And three times thrice is nine.
519: COSTARD: Not so, sir; under correction, sir; I hope it is not so.
520: You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we know
521: what we know:
522: I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,--
523: BIRON: Is not nine.
524: COSTARD: Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.
525: BIRON: By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.
526: COSTARD: O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living
527: by reckoning, sir.
528: BIRON: How much is it?
529: COSTARD: O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors,
530: sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine
531: own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man
532: in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.
533: BIRON: Art thou one of the Worthies?
534: COSTARD: It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the
535: Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of
536: the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.
537: BIRON: Go, bid them prepare.
538: COSTARD: We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take
539: some care.
540: FERDINAND: Biron, they will shame us: let them not approach.
541: BIRON: We are shame-proof, my lord: and tis some policy
542: To have one show worse than the king's and his company.
543: FERDINAND: I say they shall not come.
544: PRINCESS: Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now:
545: That sport best pleases that doth least know how:
546: Where zeal strives to content, and the contents
547: Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:
548: Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,
549: When great things labouring perish in their birth.
550: BIRON: A right description of our sport, my lord.
551: DON
552: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal
553: sweet breath as will utter a brace of words.
554: PRINCESS: Doth this man serve God?
555: BIRON: Why ask you?
556: PRINCESS: He speaks not like a man of God's making.
557: DON
558: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for,
559: I protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding
560: fantastical; too, too vain, too too vain: but we
561: will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la guerra.
562: I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!
563: FERDINAND: Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He
564: presents Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the
565: Great; the parish curate, Alexander; Armado's page,
566: Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus: And if
567: these four Worthies in their first show thrive,
568: These four will change habits, and present the other five.
569: BIRON: There is five in the first show.
570: FERDINAND: You are deceived; 'tis not so.
571: BIRON: The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool
572: and the boy:--
573: Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again
574: Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein.
575: FERDINAND: The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.
576: COSTARD: I Pompey am,--
577: BOYET: You lie, you are not he.
578: COSTARD: I Pompey am,--
579: BOYET: With libbard's head on knee.
580: BIRON: Well said, old mocker: I must needs be friends
581: with thee.
582: COSTARD: I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big--
583: DUMAIN: The Great.
584: COSTARD: It is, 'Great,' sir:--
585: Pompey surnamed the Great;
586: That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make
587: my foe to sweat:
588: And travelling along this coast, I here am come by chance,
589: And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France,
590: If your ladyship would say, 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.
591: PRINCESS: Great thanks, great Pompey.
592: COSTARD: 'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect: I
593: made a little fault in 'Great.'
594: BIRON: My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.
595: SIR NATHANIEL: When in the world I lived, I was the world's
596: commander;
597: By east, west, north, and south, I spread my
598: conquering might:
599: My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander,--
600: BOYET: Your nose says, no, you are not for it stands too right.
601: BIRON: Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling knight.
602: PRINCESS: The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed, good Alexander.
603: SIR NATHANIEL: When in the world I lived, I was the world's
604: commander,--
605: BOYET: Most true, 'tis right; you were so, Alisander.
606: BIRON: Pompey the Great,--
607: COSTARD: Your servant, and Costard.
608: BIRON: Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.
609: COSTARD: [To SIR NATHANIEL] O, sir, you have overthrown
610: Alisander the conqueror! You will be scraped out of
611: the painted cloth for this: your lion, that holds
612: his poll-axe sitting on a close-stool, will be given
613: to Ajax: he will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror,
614: and afeard to speak! run away for shame, Alisander.
615: There, an't shall please you; a foolish mild man; an
616: honest man, look you, and soon dashed. He is a
617: marvellous good neighbour, faith, and a very good
618: bowler: but, for Alisander,--alas, you see how
619: 'tis,--a little o'erparted. But there are Worthies
620: a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort.
621: HOLOFERNES: Great Hercules is presented by this imp,
622: Whose club kill'd Cerberus, that three-headed canis;
623: And when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp,
624: Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus.
625: Quoniam he seemeth in minority,
626: Ergo I come with this apology.
627: Keep some state in thy exit, and vanish.
628: Judas I am,--
629: DUMAIN: A Judas!
630: HOLOFERNES: Not Iscariot, sir.
631: Judas I am, ycliped Maccabaeus.
632: DUMAIN: Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.
633: BIRON: A kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas?
634: HOLOFERNES: Judas I am,--
635: DUMAIN: The more shame for you, Judas.
636: HOLOFERNES: What mean you, sir?
637: BOYET: To make Judas hang himself.
638: HOLOFERNES: Begin, sir; you are my elder.
639: BIRON: Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.
640: HOLOFERNES: I will not be put out of countenance.
641: BIRON: Because thou hast no face.
642: HOLOFERNES: What is this?
643: BOYET: A cittern-head.
644: DUMAIN: The head of a bodkin.
645: BIRON: A Death's face in a ring.
646: LONGAVILLE: The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.
647: BOYET: The pommel of Caesar's falchion.
648: DUMAIN: The carved-bone face on a flask.
649: BIRON: Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.
650: DUMAIN: Ay, and in a brooch of lead.
651: BIRON: Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.
652: And now forward; for we have put thee in countenance.
653: HOLOFERNES: You have put me out of countenance.
654: BIRON: False; we have given thee faces.
655: HOLOFERNES: But you have out-faced them all.
656: BIRON: An thou wert a lion, we would do so.
657: BOYET: Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.
658: And so adieu, sweet Jude! nay, why dost thou stay?
659: DUMAIN: For the latter end of his name.
660: BIRON: For the ass to the Jude; give it him:--Jud-as, away!
661: HOLOFERNES: This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.
662: BOYET: A light for Monsieur Judas! it grows dark, he may stumble.
663: PRINCESS: Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!
664: BIRON: Hide thy head, Achilles: here comes Hector in arms.
665: DUMAIN: Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.
666: FERDINAND: Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.
667: BOYET: But is this Hector?
668: FERDINAND: I think Hector was not so clean-timbered.
669: LONGAVILLE: His leg is too big for Hector's.
670: DUMAIN: More calf, certain.
671: BOYET: No; he is best endued in the small.
672: BIRON: This cannot be Hector.
673: DUMAIN: He's a god or a painter; for he makes faces.
674: DON
675: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,
676: Gave Hector a gift,--
677: DUMAIN: A gilt nutmeg.
678: BIRON: A lemon.
679: LONGAVILLE: Stuck with cloves.
680: DUMAIN: No, cloven.
681: DON
682: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Peace!--
683: The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty
684: Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion;
685: A man so breathed, that certain he would fight; yea
686: From morn till night, out of his pavilion.
687: I am that flower,--
688: DUMAIN: That mint.
689: LONGAVILLE: That columbine.
690: DON
691: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.
692: LONGAVILLE: I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector.
693: DUMAIN: Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.
694: DON
695: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks,
696: beat not the bones of the buried: when he breathed,
697: he was a man. But I will forward with my device.
698: Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense of hearing.
699: PRINCESS: Speak, brave Hector: we are much delighted.
700: DON
701: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: I do adore thy sweet grace's slipper.
702: BOYET: [Aside to DUMAIN] Loves her by the foot,--
703: DUMAIN: [Aside to BOYET] He may not by the yard.
704: DON
705: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: This Hector far surmounted Hannibal,--
706: COSTARD: The party is gone, fellow Hector, she is gone; she
707: is two months on her way.
708: DON
709: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: What meanest thou?
710: COSTARD: Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor
711: wench is cast away: she's quick; the child brags in
712: her belly already: tis yours.
713: DON
714: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? thou shalt
715: die.
716: COSTARD: Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is
717: quick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead by
718: him.
719: DUMAIN: Most rare Pompey!
720: BOYET: Renowned Pompey!
721: BIRON: Greater than great, great, great, great Pompey!
722: Pompey the Huge!
723: DUMAIN: Hector trembles.
724: BIRON: Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them
725: on! stir them on!
726: DUMAIN: Hector will challenge him.
727: BIRON: Ay, if a' have no man's blood in's belly than will
728: sup a flea.
729: DON
730: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: By the north pole, I do challenge thee.
731: COSTARD: I will not fight with a pole, like a northern man:
732: I'll slash; I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you,
733: let me borrow my arms again.
734: DUMAIN: Room for the incensed Worthies!
735: COSTARD: I'll do it in my shirt.
736: DUMAIN: Most resolute Pompey!
737: MOTH: Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you
738: not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean
739: you? You will lose your reputation.
740: DON
741: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat
742: in my shirt.
743: DUMAIN: You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.
744: DON
745: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Sweet bloods, I both may and will.
746: BIRON: What reason have you for't?
747: DON
748: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt; I go
749: woolward for penance.
750: BOYET: True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of
751: linen: since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but
752: a dishclout of Jaquenetta's, and that a' wears next
753: his heart for a favour.
754: MERCADE: God save you, madam!
755: PRINCESS: Welcome, Mercade;
756: But that thou interrupt'st our merriment.
757: MERCADE: I am sorry, madam; for the news I bring
758: Is heavy in my tongue. The king your father--
759: PRINCESS: Dead, for my life!
760: MERCADE: Even so; my tale is told.
761: BIRON: Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud.
762: DON
763: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have
764: seen the day of wrong through the little hole of
765: discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier.
766: FERDINAND: How fares your majesty?
767: PRINCESS: Boyet, prepare; I will away tonight.
768: FERDINAND: Madam, not so; I do beseech you, stay.
769: PRINCESS: Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
770: For all your fair endeavors; and entreat,
771: Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
772: In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
773: The liberal opposition of our spirits,
774: If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
775: In the converse of breath: your gentleness
776: Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!
777: A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:
778: Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
779: For my great suit so easily obtain'd.
780: FERDINAND: The extreme parts of time extremely forms
781: All causes to the purpose of his speed,
782: And often at his very loose decides
783: That which long process could not arbitrate:
784: And though the mourning brow of progeny
785: Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
786: The holy suit which fain it would convince,
787: Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
788: Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
789: From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost
790: Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
791: As to rejoice at friends but newly found.
792: PRINCESS: I understand you not: my griefs are double.
793: BIRON: Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
794: And by these badges understand the king.
795: For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
796: Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,
797: Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours
798: Even to the opposed end of our intents:
799: And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--
800: As love is full of unbefitting strains,
801: All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,
802: Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,
803: Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,
804: Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
805: To every varied object in his glance:
806: Which parti-coated presence of loose love
807: Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,
808: Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,
809: Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,
810: Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
811: Our love being yours, the error that love makes
812: Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,
813: By being once false for ever to be true
814: To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:
815: And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
816: Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.
817: PRINCESS: We have received your letters full of love;
818: Your favours, the ambassadors of love;
819: And, in our maiden council, rated them
820: At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,
821: As bombast and as lining to the time:
822: But more devout than this in our respects
823: Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
824: In their own fashion, like a merriment.
825: DUMAIN: Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.
826: LONGAVILLE: So did our looks.
827: ROSALINE: We did not quote them so.
828: FERDINAND: Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
829: Grant us your loves.
830: PRINCESS: A time, methinks, too short
831: To make a world-without-end bargain in.
832: No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,
833: Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:
834: If for my love, as there is no such cause,
835: You will do aught, this shall you do for me:
836: Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
837: To some forlorn and naked hermitage,
838: Remote from all the pleasures of the world;
839: There stay until the twelve celestial signs
840: Have brought about the annual reckoning.
841: If this austere insociable life
842: Change not your offer made in heat of blood;
843: If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds
844: Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
845: But that it bear this trial and last love;
846: Then, at the expiration of the year,
847: Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,
848: And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine
849: I will be thine; and till that instant shut
850: My woeful self up in a mourning house,
851: Raining the tears of lamentation
852: For the remembrance of my father's death.
853: If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
854: Neither entitled in the other's heart.
855: FERDINAND: If this, or more than this, I would deny,
856: To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,
857: The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
858: Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.
859: DUMAIN: But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?
860: KATHARINE: A beard, fair health, and honesty;
861: With three-fold love I wish you all these three.
862: DUMAIN: O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
863: KATHARINE: Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day
864: I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:
865: Come when the king doth to my lady come;
866: Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.
867: DUMAIN: I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
868: KATHARINE: Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.
869: LONGAVILLE: What says Maria?
870: MARIA: At the twelvemonth's end
871: I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.
872: LONGAVILLE: I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.
873: MARIA: The liker you; few taller are so young.
874: BIRON: Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;
875: Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,
876: What humble suit attends thy answer there:
877: Impose some service on me for thy love.
878: ROSALINE: Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,
879: Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue
880: Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
881: Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
882: Which you on all estates will execute
883: That lie within the mercy of your wit.
884: To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
885: And therewithal to win me, if you please,
886: Without the which I am not to be won,
887: You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
888: Visit the speechless sick and still converse
889: With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
890: With all the fierce endeavor of your wit
891: To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
892: BIRON: To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
893: It cannot be; it is impossible:
894: Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.
895: ROSALINE: Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
896: Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
897: Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:
898: A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
899: Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
900: Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,
901: Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
902: Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,
903: And I will have you and that fault withal;
904: But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
905: And I shall find you empty of that fault,
906: Right joyful of your reformation.
907: BIRON: A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,
908: I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.
909: PRINCESS: [To FERDINAND] Ay, sweet my lord; and so I take my leave.
910: FERDINAND: No, madam; we will bring you on your way.
911: BIRON: Our wooing doth not end like an old play;
912: Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy
913: Might well have made our sport a comedy.
914: FERDINAND: Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,
915: And then 'twill end.
916: BIRON: That's too long for a play.
917: DON
918: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Sweet majesty, vouchsafe me,--
919: PRINCESS: Was not that Hector?
920: DUMAIN: The worthy knight of Troy.
921: DON
922: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am
923: a votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the
924: plough for her sweet love three years. But, most
925: esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue that
926: the two learned men have compiled in praise of the
927: owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the
928: end of our show.
929: FERDINAND: Call them forth quickly; we will do so.
930: DON
931: ADRIANO DE ARMADO: Holla! approach.
932: This side is Hiems, Winter, this Ver, the Spring;
933: the one maintained by the owl, the other by the
934: cuckoo. Ver, begin.
935: SPRING.
936: When daisies pied and violets blue
937: And lady-smocks all silver-white
938: And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
939: Do paint the meadows with delight,
940: The cuckoo then, on every tree,
941: Mocks married men; for thus sings he, Cuckoo;
942: Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
943: Unpleasing to a married ear!
944: When shepherds pipe on oaten straws
945: And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,
946: When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,
947: And maidens bleach their summer smocks
948: The cuckoo then, on every tree,
949: Mocks married men; for thus sings he, Cuckoo;
950: Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
951: Unpleasing to a married ear!
952: WINTER.
953: When icicles hang by the wall
954: And Dick the shepherd blows his nail
955: And Tom bears logs into the hall
956: And milk comes frozen home in pail,
957: When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,
958: Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit;
959: Tu-who, a merry note,
960: While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
961: When all aloud the wind doth blow
962: And coughing drowns the parson's saw
963: And birds sit brooding in the snow
964: And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
965: When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
966: Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit;
967: Tu-who, a merry note,
968: While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
969: DON
