ACT 1 SCENE 1

1: GLOUCESTER: Now is the winter of our discontent
2: Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
3: And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
4: In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
5: Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
6: Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
7: Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
8: Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
9: Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
10: And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds
11: To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
12: He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
13: To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
14: But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
15: Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
16: I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
17: To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
18: I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
19: Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
20: Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
21: Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
22: And that so lamely and unfashionable
23: That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
24: Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
25: Have no delight to pass away the time,
26: Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
27: And descant on mine own deformity:
28: And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
29: To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
30: I am determined to prove a villain
31: And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
32: Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
33: By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
34: To set my brother Clarence and the king
35: In deadly hate the one against the other:
36: And if King Edward be as true and just
37: As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
38: This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
39: About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
40: Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
41: Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
42: Clarence comes.
43: Brother, good day; what means this armed guard
44: That waits upon your grace?
45: CLARENCE: His majesty
46: Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
47: This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
48: GLOUCESTER: Upon what cause?
49: CLARENCE: Because my name is George.
50: GLOUCESTER: Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
51: He should, for that, commit your godfathers:
52: O, belike his majesty hath some intent
53: That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
54: But what's the matter, Clarence? may I know?
55: CLARENCE: Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
56: As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
57: He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
58: And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
59: And says a wizard told him that by G
60: His issue disinherited should be;
61: And, for my name of George begins with G,
62: It follows in his thought that I am he.
63: These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
64: Have moved his highness to commit me now.
65: GLOUCESTER: Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:
66: 'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:
67: My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
68: That tempers him to this extremity.
69: Was it not she and that good man of worship,
70: Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
71: That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
72: From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
73: We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
74: CLARENCE: By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
75: But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
76: That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
77: Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
78: Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?
79: GLOUCESTER: Humbly complaining to her deity
80: Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
81: I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
82: If we will keep in favour with the king,
83: To be her men and wear her livery:
84: The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
85: Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.
86: Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.
87: BRAKENBURY: I beseech your graces both to pardon me;
88: His majesty hath straitly given in charge
89: That no man shall have private conference,
90: Of what degree soever, with his brother.
91: GLOUCESTER: Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
92: You may partake of any thing we say:
93: We speak no treason, man: we say the king
94: Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
95: Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
96: We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
97: A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
98: And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:
99: How say you sir? Can you deny all this?
100: BRAKENBURY: With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.
101: GLOUCESTER: Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
102: He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
103: Were best he do it secretly, alone.
104: BRAKENBURY: What one, my lord?
105: GLOUCESTER: Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?
106: BRAKENBURY: I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal
107: Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
108: CLARENCE: We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
109: GLOUCESTER: We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
110: Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
111: And whatsoever you will employ me in,
112: Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,
113: I will perform it to enfranchise you.
114: Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
115: Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
116: CLARENCE: I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
117: GLOUCESTER: Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
118: Meantime, have patience.
119: CLARENCE: I must perforce. Farewell.
120: GLOUCESTER: Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
121: Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
122: That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
123: If heaven will take the present at our hands.
124: But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?
125: HASTINGS: Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
126: GLOUCESTER: As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
127: Well are you welcome to the open air.
128: How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
129: HASTINGS: With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
130: But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
131: That were the cause of my imprisonment.
132: GLOUCESTER: No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
133: For they that were your enemies are his,
134: And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
135: HASTINGS: More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,
136: While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
137: GLOUCESTER: What news abroad?
138: HASTINGS: No news so bad abroad as this at home;
139: The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,
140: And his physicians fear him mightily.
141: GLOUCESTER: Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
142: O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
143: And overmuch consumed his royal person:
144: 'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
145: What, is he in his bed?
146: HASTINGS: He is.
147: GLOUCESTER: Go you before, and I will follow you.
148: He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
149: Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
150: I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
151: With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
152: And, if I fall not in my deep intent,
153: Clarence hath not another day to live:
154: Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
155: And leave the world for me to bustle in!
156: For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
157: What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
158: The readiest way to make the wench amends
159: Is to become her husband and her father:
160: The which will I; not all so much for love
161: As for another secret close intent,
162: By marrying her which I must reach unto.
163: But yet I run before my horse to market:
164: Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
165: When they are gone, then must I count my gains.
ACT 1 SCENE 2

1: LADY ANNE: Set down, set down your honourable load,
2: If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
3: Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
4: The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
5: Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
6: Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
7: Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
8: Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
9: To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,
10: Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,
11: Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!
12: Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
13: I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
14: Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
15: Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
16: Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
17: More direful hap betide that hated wretch,
18: That makes us wretched by the death of thee,
19: Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
20: Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
21: If ever he have child, abortive be it,
22: Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
23: Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
24: May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
25: And that be heir to his unhappiness!
26: If ever he have wife, let her he made
27: A miserable by the death of him
28: As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
29: Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
30: Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
31: And still, as you are weary of the weight,
32: Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.
33: GLOUCESTER: Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
34: LADY ANNE: What black magician conjures up this fiend,
35: To stop devoted charitable deeds?
36: GLOUCESTER: Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
37: I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.
38: Gentleman: My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.
39: GLOUCESTER: Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
40: Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,
41: Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
42: And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
43: LADY ANNE: What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?
44: Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,
45: And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
46: Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
47: Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
48: His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.
49: GLOUCESTER: Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
50: LADY ANNE: Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;
51: For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
52: Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
53: If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
54: Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
55: O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
56: Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
57: Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
58: For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
59: From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
60: Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
61: Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
62: O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!
63: O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!
64: Either heaven with lightning strike the
65: murderer dead,
66: Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
67: As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
68: Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!
69: GLOUCESTER: Lady, you know no rules of charity,
70: Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
71: LADY ANNE: Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
72: No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
73: GLOUCESTER: But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
74: LADY ANNE: O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
75: GLOUCESTER: More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
76: Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
77: Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,
78: By circumstance, but to acquit myself.
79: LADY ANNE: Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,
80: For these known evils, but to give me leave,
81: By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.
82: GLOUCESTER: Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
83: Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
84: LADY ANNE: Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
85: No excuse current, but to hang thyself.
86: GLOUCESTER: By such despair, I should accuse myself.
87: LADY ANNE: And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
88: For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
89: Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
90: GLOUCESTER: Say that I slew them not?
91: LADY ANNE: Why, then they are not dead:
92: But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.
93: GLOUCESTER: I did not kill your husband.
94: LADY ANNE: Why, then he is alive.
95: GLOUCESTER: Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.
96: LADY ANNE: In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
97: Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
98: The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
99: But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
100: GLOUCESTER: I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
101: which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
102: LADY ANNE: Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
103: Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:
104: Didst thou not kill this king?
105: GLOUCESTER: I grant ye.
106: LADY ANNE: Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too
107: Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
108: O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!
109: GLOUCESTER: The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.
110: LADY ANNE: He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
111: GLOUCESTER: Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;
112: For he was fitter for that place than earth.
113: LADY ANNE: And thou unfit for any place but hell.
114: GLOUCESTER: Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
115: LADY ANNE: Some dungeon.
116: GLOUCESTER: Your bed-chamber.
117: LADY ANNE: Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
118: GLOUCESTER: So will it, madam till I lie with you.
119: LADY ANNE: I hope so.
120: GLOUCESTER: I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
121: To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
122: And fall somewhat into a slower method,
123: Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
124: Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
125: As blameful as the executioner?
126: LADY ANNE: Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.
127: GLOUCESTER: Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
128: Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
129: To undertake the death of all the world,
130: So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
131: LADY ANNE: If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
132: These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
133: GLOUCESTER: These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
134: You should not blemish it, if I stood by:
135: As all the world is cheered by the sun,
136: So I by that; it is my day, my life.
137: LADY ANNE: Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
138: GLOUCESTER: Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.
139: LADY ANNE: I would I were, to be revenged on thee.
140: GLOUCESTER: It is a quarrel most unnatural,
141: To be revenged on him that loveth you.
142: LADY ANNE: It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
143: To be revenged on him that slew my husband.
144: GLOUCESTER: He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
145: Did it to help thee to a better husband.
146: LADY ANNE: His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
147: GLOUCESTER: He lives that loves thee better than he could.
148: LADY ANNE: Name him.
149: GLOUCESTER: Plantagenet.
150: LADY ANNE: Why, that was he.
151: GLOUCESTER: The selfsame name, but one of better nature.
152: LADY ANNE: Where is he?
153: GLOUCESTER: Here.
154: Why dost thou spit at me?
155: LADY ANNE: Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
156: GLOUCESTER: Never came poison from so sweet a place.
157: LADY ANNE: Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
158: Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.
159: GLOUCESTER: Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
160: LADY ANNE: Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!
161: GLOUCESTER: I would they were, that I might die at once;
162: For now they kill me with a living death.
163: Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
164: Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
165: These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
166: No, when my father York and Edward wept,
167: To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
168: When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
169: Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
170: Told the sad story of my father's death,
171: And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
172: That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
173: Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
174: My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
175: And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
176: Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
177: I never sued to friend nor enemy;
178: My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
179: But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
180: My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
181: Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
182: For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
183: If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
184: Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
185: Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
186: And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
187: I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
188: And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
189: Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
190: But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
191: Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,
192: But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
193: Take up the sword again, or take up me.
194: LADY ANNE: Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
195: I will not be the executioner.
196: GLOUCESTER: Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.
197: LADY ANNE: I have already.
198: GLOUCESTER: Tush, that was in thy rage:
199: Speak it again, and, even with the word,
200: That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
201: Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
202: To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.
203: LADY ANNE: I would I knew thy heart.
204: GLOUCESTER: 'Tis figured in my tongue.
205: LADY ANNE: I fear me both are false.
206: GLOUCESTER: Then never man was true.
207: LADY ANNE: Well, well, put up your sword.
208: GLOUCESTER: Say, then, my peace is made.
209: LADY ANNE: That shall you know hereafter.
210: GLOUCESTER: But shall I live in hope?
211: LADY ANNE: All men, I hope, live so.
212: GLOUCESTER: Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
213: LADY ANNE: To take is not to give.
214: GLOUCESTER: Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.
215: Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
216: Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
217: And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
218: But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
219: Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
220: LADY ANNE: What is it?
221: GLOUCESTER: That it would please thee leave these sad designs
222: To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,
223: And presently repair to Crosby Place;
224: Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
225: At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
226: And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
227: I will with all expedient duty see you:
228: For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,
229: Grant me this boon.
230: LADY ANNE: With all my heart; and much it joys me too,
231: To see you are become so penitent.
232: Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
233: GLOUCESTER: Bid me farewell.
234: LADY ANNE: 'Tis more than you deserve;
235: But since you teach me how to flatter you,
236: Imagine I have said farewell already.
237: GLOUCESTER: Sirs, take up the corse.
238: GENTLEMEN: Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
239: GLOUCESTER: No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.
240: Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
241: Was ever woman in this humour won?
242: I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
243: What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,
244: To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
245: With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
246: The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
247: Having God, her conscience, and these bars
248: against me,
249: And I nothing to back my suit at all,
250: But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
251: And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
252: Ha!
253: Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
254: Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
255: Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
256: A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
257: Framed in the prodigality of nature,
258: Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
259: The spacious world cannot again afford
260: And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
261: That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
262: And made her widow to a woful bed?
263: On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
264: On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
265: My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
266: I do mistake my person all this while:
267: Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
268: Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
269: I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
270: And entertain some score or two of tailors,
271: To study fashions to adorn my body:
272: Since I am crept in favour with myself,
273: Will maintain it with some little cost.
274: But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
275: And then return lamenting to my love.
276: Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
277: That I may see my shadow as I pass.
ACT 1 SCENE 3

1: RIVERS: Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty
2: Will soon recover his accustom'd health.
3: GREY: In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:
4: Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
5: And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.
6: QUEEN ELIZABETH: If he were dead, what would betide of me?
7: RIVERS: No other harm but loss of such a lord.
8: QUEEN ELIZABETH: The loss of such a lord includes all harm.
9: GREY: The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,
10: To be your comforter when he is gone.
11: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Oh, he is young and his minority
12: Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
13: A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
14: RIVERS: Is it concluded that he shall be protector?
15: QUEEN ELIZABETH: It is determined, not concluded yet:
16: But so it must be, if the king miscarry.
17: GREY: Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.
18: BUCKINGHAM: Good time of day unto your royal grace!
19: DERBY: God make your majesty joyful as you have been!
20: QUEEN ELIZABETH: The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.
21: To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
22: Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
23: And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
24: I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
25: DERBY: I do beseech you, either not believe
26: The envious slanders of her false accusers;
27: Or, if she be accused in true report,
28: Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
29: From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.
30: RIVERS: Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?
31: DERBY: But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
32: Are come from visiting his majesty.
33: QUEEN ELIZABETH: What likelihood of his amendment, lords?
34: BUCKINGHAM: Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.
35: QUEEN ELIZABETH: God grant him health! Did you confer with him?
36: BUCKINGHAM: Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement
37: Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
38: And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;
39: And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
40: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Would all were well! but that will never be
41: I fear our happiness is at the highest.
42: GLOUCESTER: They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
43: Who are they that complain unto the king,
44: That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
45: By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
46: That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
47: Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
48: Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
49: Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
50: I must be held a rancorous enemy.
51: Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
52: But thus his simple truth must be abused
53: By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
54: RIVERS: To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?
55: GLOUCESTER: To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
56: When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
57: Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
58: A plague upon you all! His royal person,--
59: Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
60: Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
61: But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
62: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
63: The king, of his own royal disposition,
64: And not provoked by any suitor else;
65: Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
66: Which in your outward actions shows itself
67: Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
68: Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
69: The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.
70: GLOUCESTER: I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
71: That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
72: Since every Jack became a gentleman
73: There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
74: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
75: Gloucester;
76: You envy my advancement and my friends':
77: God grant we never may have need of you!
78: GLOUCESTER: Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:
79: Your brother is imprison'd by your means,
80: Myself disgraced, and the nobility
81: Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions
82: Are daily given to ennoble those
83: That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.
84: QUEEN ELIZABETH: By Him that raised me to this careful height
85: From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
86: I never did incense his majesty
87: Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
88: An earnest advocate to plead for him.
89: My lord, you do me shameful injury,
90: Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
91: GLOUCESTER: You may deny that you were not the cause
92: Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
93: RIVERS: She may, my lord, for--
94: GLOUCESTER: She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
95: She may do more, sir, than denying that:
96: She may help you to many fair preferments,
97: And then deny her aiding hand therein,
98: And lay those honours on your high deserts.
99: What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--
100: RIVERS: What, marry, may she?
101: GLOUCESTER: What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
102: A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:
103: I wis your grandam had a worser match.
104: QUEEN ELIZABETH: My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
105: Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
106: By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
107: With those gross taunts I often have endured.
108: I had rather be a country servant-maid
109: Than a great queen, with this condition,
110: To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:
111: Small joy have I in being England's queen.
112: QUEEN MARGARET: And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
113: Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.
114: GLOUCESTER: What! threat you me with telling of the king?
115: Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
116: I will avouch in presence of the king:
117: I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
118: 'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.
119: QUEEN MARGARET: Out, devil! I remember them too well:
120: Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,
121: And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
122: GLOUCESTER: Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
123: I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
124: A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
125: A liberal rewarder of his friends:
126: To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.
127: QUEEN MARGARET: Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.
128: GLOUCESTER: In all which time you and your husband Grey
129: Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
130: And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
131: In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
132: Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
133: What you have been ere now, and what you are;
134: Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
135: QUEEN MARGARET: A murderous villain, and so still thou art.
136: GLOUCESTER: Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;
137: Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--
138: QUEEN MARGARET: Which God revenge!
139: GLOUCESTER: To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
140: And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
141: I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;
142: Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
143: I am too childish-foolish for this world.
144: QUEEN MARGARET: Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,
145: Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.
146: RIVERS: My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
147: Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
148: We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:
149: So should we you, if you should be our king.
150: GLOUCESTER: If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
151: Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!
152: QUEEN ELIZABETH: As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
153: You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
154: As little joy may you suppose in me.
155: That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.
156: QUEEN MARGARET: A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
157: For I am she, and altogether joyless.
158: I can no longer hold me patient.
159: Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
160: In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
161: Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
162: If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,
163: Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?
164: O gentle villain, do not turn away!
165: GLOUCESTER: Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?
166: QUEEN MARGARET: But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
167: That will I make before I let thee go.
168: GLOUCESTER: Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
169: QUEEN MARGARET: I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
170: Than death can yield me here by my abode.
171: A husband and a son thou owest to me;
172: And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
173: The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
174: And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
175: GLOUCESTER: The curse my noble father laid on thee,
176: When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
177: And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
178: And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
179: Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
180: His curses, then from bitterness of soul
181: Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
182: And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.
183: QUEEN ELIZABETH: So just is God, to right the innocent.
184: HASTINGS: O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
185: And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
186: RIVERS: Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
187: DORSET: No man but prophesied revenge for it.
188: BUCKINGHAM: Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
189: QUEEN MARGARET: What were you snarling all before I came,
190: Ready to catch each other by the throat,
191: And turn you all your hatred now on me?
192: Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?
193: That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
194: Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
195: Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
196: Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
197: Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
198: If not by war, by surfeit die your king,
199: As ours by murder, to make him a king!
200: Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
201: For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
202: Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
203: Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
204: Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
205: Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
206: And see another, as I see thee now,
207: Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
208: Long die thy happy days before thy death;
209: And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
210: Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
211: Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
212: And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
213: Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
214: That none of you may live your natural age,
215: But by some unlook'd accident cut off!
216: GLOUCESTER: Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
217: QUEEN MARGARET: And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
218: If heaven have any grievous plague in store
219: Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
220: O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
221: And then hurl down their indignation
222: On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
223: The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
224: Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
225: And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
226: No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
227: Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
228: Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
229: Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
230: Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
231: The slave of nature and the son of hell!
232: Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
233: Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
234: Thou rag of honour! thou detested--
235: GLOUCESTER: Margaret.
236: QUEEN MARGARET: Richard!
237: GLOUCESTER: Ha!
238: QUEEN MARGARET: I call thee not.
239: GLOUCESTER: I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
240: That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
241: QUEEN MARGARET: Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.
242: O, let me make the period to my curse!
243: GLOUCESTER: 'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'
244: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.
245: QUEEN MARGARET: Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
246: Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
247: Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
248: Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
249: The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
250: To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.
251: HASTINGS: False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
252: Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
253: QUEEN MARGARET: Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.
254: RIVERS: Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.
255: QUEEN MARGARET: To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
256: Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
257: O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!
258: DORSET: Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
259: QUEEN MARGARET: Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
260: Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
261: O, that your young nobility could judge
262: What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
263: They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;
264: And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.
265: GLOUCESTER: Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.
266: DORSET: It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.
267: GLOUCESTER: Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,
268: Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
269: And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.
270: QUEEN MARGARET: And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
271: Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
272: Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
273: Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
274: Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
275: O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
276: As it was won with blood, lost be it so!
277: BUCKINGHAM: Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
278: QUEEN MARGARET: Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
279: Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
280: And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.
281: My charity is outrage, life my shame
282: And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.
283: BUCKINGHAM: Have done, have done.
284: QUEEN MARGARET: O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,
285: In sign of league and amity with thee:
286: Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!
287: Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
288: Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
289: BUCKINGHAM: Nor no one here; for curses never pass
290: The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
291: QUEEN MARGARET: I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
292: And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
293: O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
294: Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
295: His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
296: Have not to do with him, beware of him;
297: Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
298: And all their ministers attend on him.
299: GLOUCESTER: What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
300: BUCKINGHAM: Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
301: QUEEN MARGARET: What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
302: And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
303: O, but remember this another day,
304: When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
305: And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
306: Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
307: And he to yours, and all of you to God's!
308: HASTINGS: My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.
309: RIVERS: And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.
310: GLOUCESTER: I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,
311: She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
312: My part thereof that I have done to her.
313: QUEEN ELIZABETH: I never did her any, to my knowledge.
314: GLOUCESTER: But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
315: I was too hot to do somebody good,
316: That is too cold in thinking of it now.
317: Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,
318: He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
319: God pardon them that are the cause of it!
320: RIVERS: A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
321: To pray for them that have done scathe to us.
322: GLOUCESTER: So do I ever:
323: being well-advised.
324: For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.
325: CATESBY: Madam, his majesty doth call for you,
326: And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.
327: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?
328: RIVERS: Madam, we will attend your grace.
329: GLOUCESTER: I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
330: The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
331: I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
332: Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
333: I do beweep to many simple gulls
334: Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
335: And say it is the queen and her allies
336: That stir the king against the duke my brother.
337: Now, they believe it; and withal whet me
338: To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
339: But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
340: Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
341: And thus I clothe my naked villany
342: With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
343: And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.
344: But, soft! here come my executioners.
345: How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
346: Are you now going to dispatch this deed?
347: First Murderer: We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant
348: That we may be admitted where he is.
349: GLOUCESTER: Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
350: When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
351: But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
352: Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
353: For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
354: May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.
355: First Murderer: Tush!
356: Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;
357: Talkers are no good doers: be assured
358: We come to use our hands and not our tongues.
359: GLOUCESTER: Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:
360: I like you, lads; about your business straight;
361: Go, go, dispatch.
362: First Murderer: We will, my noble lord.
ACT 1 SCENE 4

1: BRAKENBURY: Why looks your grace so heavily today?
2: CLARENCE: O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
3: So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
4: That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
5: I would not spend another such a night,
6: Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
7: So full of dismal terror was the time!
8: BRAKENBURY: What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.
9: CLARENCE: Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
10: And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
11: And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
12: Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
13: Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
14: And cited up a thousand fearful times,
15: During the wars of York and Lancaster
16: That had befall'n us. As we paced along
17: Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
18: Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
19: Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
20: Into the tumbling billows of the main.
21: Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
22: What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
23: What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
24: Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
25: Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
26: Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
27: Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
28: All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
29: Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
30: Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
31: As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
32: Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
33: And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.
34: BRAKENBURY: Had you such leisure in the time of death
35: To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
36: CLARENCE: Methought I had; and often did I strive
37: To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
38: Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
39: To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
40: But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
41: Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.
42: BRAKENBURY: Awaked you not with this sore agony?
43: CLARENCE: O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
44: O, then began the tempest to my soul,
45: Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
46: With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
47: Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
48: The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
49: Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
50: Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
51: Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
52: And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
53: A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
54: Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
55: 'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
56: That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
57: Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'
58: With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
59: Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears
60: Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
61: I trembling waked, and for a season after
62: Could not believe but that I was in hell,
63: Such terrible impression made the dream.
64: BRAKENBURY: No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
65: I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.
66: CLARENCE: O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
67: Which now bear evidence against my soul,
68: For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
69: O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
70: But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
71: Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
72: O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
73: I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
74: My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
75: BRAKENBURY: I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
76: Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
77: Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
78: Princes have but their tides for their glories,
79: An outward honour for an inward toil;
80: And, for unfelt imagination,
81: They often feel a world of restless cares:
82: So that, betwixt their tides and low names,
83: There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
84: First Murderer: Ho! who's here?
85: BRAKENBURY: In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?
86: First Murderer: I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.
87: BRAKENBURY: Yea, are you so brief?
88: Second Murderer: O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show
89: him our commission; talk no more.
90: BRAKENBURY: I am, in this, commanded to deliver
91: The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
92: I will not reason what is meant hereby,
93: Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
94: Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:
95: I'll to the king; and signify to him
96: That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.
97: First Murderer: Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.
98: Second Murderer: What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?
99: First Murderer: No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.
100: Second Murderer: When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till
101: the judgment-day.
102: First Murderer: Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.
103: Second Murderer: The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
104: of remorse in me.
105: First Murderer: What, art thou afraid?
106: Second Murderer: Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be
107: damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.
108: First Murderer: I thought thou hadst been resolute.
109: Second Murderer: So I am, to let him live.
110: First Murderer: Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.
111: Second Murderer: I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour
112: will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one
113: would tell twenty.
114: First Murderer: How dost thou feel thyself now?
115: Second Murderer: 'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet
116: within me.
117: First Murderer: Remember our reward, when the deed is done.
118: Second Murderer: 'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.
119: First Murderer: Where is thy conscience now?
120: Second Murderer: In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.
121: First Murderer: So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
122: thy conscience flies out.
123: Second Murderer: Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.
124: First Murderer: How if it come to thee again?
125: Second Murderer: I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
126: makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it
127: accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;
128: he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it
129: detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
130: mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
131: obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
132: that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it
133: is turned out of all towns and cities for a
134: dangerous thing; and every man that means to live
135: well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
136: without it.
137: First Murderer: 'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me
138: not to kill the duke.
139: Second Murderer: Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he
140: would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.
141: First Murderer: Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,
142: I warrant thee.
143: Second Murderer: Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
144: reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
145: First Murderer: Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
146: sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt
147: in the next room.
148: Second Murderer: O excellent devise! make a sop of him.
149: First Murderer: Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?
150: Second Murderer: No, first let's reason with him.
151: CLARENCE: Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.
152: Second murderer: You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
153: CLARENCE: In God's name, what art thou?
154: Second Murderer: A man, as you are.
155: CLARENCE: But not, as I am, royal.
156: Second Murderer: Nor you, as we are, loyal.
157: CLARENCE: Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
158: Second Murderer: My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.
159: CLARENCE: How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
160: Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
161: Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
162: Both: To, to, to--
163: CLARENCE: To murder me?
164: Both: Ay, ay.
165: CLARENCE: You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
166: And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
167: Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
168: First Murderer: Offended us you have not, but the king.
169: CLARENCE: I shall be reconciled to him again.
170: Second Murderer: Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
171: CLARENCE: Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
172: To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
173: Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
174: What lawful quest have given their verdict up
175: Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
176: The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
177: Before I be convict by course of law,
178: To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
179: I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
180: By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
181: That you depart and lay no hands on me
182: The deed you undertake is damnable.
183: First Murderer: What we will do, we do upon command.
184: Second Murderer: And he that hath commanded is the king.
185: CLARENCE: Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
186: Hath in the tables of his law commanded
187: That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
188: Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
189: Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
190: To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
191: Second Murderer: And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
192: For false forswearing and for murder too:
193: Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,
194: To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
195: First Murderer: And, like a traitor to the name of God,
196: Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
197: Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.
198: Second Murderer: Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.
199: First Murderer: How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
200: When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?
201: CLARENCE: Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
202: For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,
203: He sends ye not to murder me for this
204: For in this sin he is as deep as I.
205: If God will be revenged for this deed.
206: O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,
207: Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
208: He needs no indirect nor lawless course
209: To cut off those that have offended him.
210: First Murderer: Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,
211: When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
212: That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
213: CLARENCE: My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
214: First Murderer: Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,
215: Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
216: CLARENCE: Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
217: I am his brother, and I love him well.
218: If you be hired for meed, go back again,
219: And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
220: Who shall reward you better for my life
221: Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
222: Second Murderer: You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.
223: CLARENCE: O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
224: Go you to him from me.
225: Both: Ay, so we will.
226: CLARENCE: Tell him, when that our princely father York
227: Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
228: And charged us from his soul to love each other,
229: He little thought of this divided friendship:
230: Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
231: First Murderer: Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.
232: CLARENCE: O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
233: First Murderer: Right,
234: As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:
235: 'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.
236: CLARENCE: It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
237: He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
238: That he would labour my delivery.
239: Second Murderer: Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
240: From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
241: First Murderer: Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
242: CLARENCE: Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
243: To counsel me to make my peace with God,
244: And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
245: That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
246: Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
247: To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
248: Second Murderer: What shall we do?
249: CLARENCE: Relent, and save your souls.
250: First Murderer: Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.
251: CLARENCE: Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
252: Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
253: Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
254: if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
255: Would not entreat for life?
256: My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
257: O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
258: Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
259: As you would beg, were you in my distress
260: A begging prince what beggar pities not?
261: Second Murderer: Look behind you, my lord.
262: First Murderer: Take that, and that: if all this will not do,
263: I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
264: Second Murderer: A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!
265: How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
266: Of this most grievous guilty murder done!
267: First Murderer: How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?
268: By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!
269: Second Murderer: I would he knew that I had saved his brother!
270: Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
271: For I repent me that the duke is slain.
ACT 2 SCENE 1

1: KING EDWARD IV: Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:
2: You peers, continue this united league:
3: I every day expect an embassage
4: From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
5: And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,
6: Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.
7: Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
8: Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.
9: RIVERS: By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:
10: And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.
11: HASTINGS: So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
12: KING EDWARD IV: Take heed you dally not before your king;
13: Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
14: Confound your hidden falsehood, and award
15: Either of you to be the other's end.
16: HASTINGS: So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
17: RIVERS: And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
18: KING EDWARD IV: Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
19: Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;
20: You have been factious one against the other,
21: Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
22: And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
23: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Here, Hastings; I will never more remember
24: Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!
25: KING EDWARD IV: Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.
26: DORSET: This interchange of love, I here protest,
27: Upon my part shall be unviolable.
28: HASTINGS: And so swear I, my lord
29: KING EDWARD IV: Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league
30: With thy embracements to my wife's allies,
31: And make me happy in your unity.
32: BUCKINGHAM: Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
33: On you or yours,
34: but with all duteous love
35: Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
36: With hate in those where I expect most love!
37: When I have most need to employ a friend,
38: And most assured that he is a friend
39: Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
40: Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,
41: When I am cold in zeal to yours.
42: KING EDWARD IV: A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
43: is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
44: There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,
45: To make the perfect period of this peace.
46: BUCKINGHAM: And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.
47: GLOUCESTER: Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:
48: And, princely peers, a happy time of day!
49: KING EDWARD IV: Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
50: Brother, we done deeds of charity;
51: Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,
52: Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.
53: GLOUCESTER: A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:
54: Amongst this princely heap, if any here,
55: By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,
56: Hold me a foe;
57: If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
58: Have aught committed that is hardly borne
59: By any in this presence, I desire
60: To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
61: 'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
62: I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
63: First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
64: Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
65: Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
66: If ever any grudge were lodged between us;
67: Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;
68: That without desert have frown'd on me;
69: Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
70: I do not know that Englishman alive
71: With whom my soul is any jot at odds
72: More than the infant that is born to-night
73: I thank my God for my humility.
74: QUEEN ELIZABETH: A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:
75: I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
76: My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty
77: To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
78: GLOUCESTER: Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this
79: To be so bouted in this royal presence?
80: Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
81: You do him injury to scorn his corse.
82: RIVERS: Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?
83: QUEEN ELIZABETH: All seeing heaven, what a world is this!
84: BUCKINGHAM: Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
85: DORSET: Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence
86: But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.
87: KING EDWARD IV: Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
88: GLOUCESTER: But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
89: And that a winged Mercury did bear:
90: Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
91: That came too lag to see him buried.
92: God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
93: Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
94: Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
95: And yet go current from suspicion!
96: DERBY: A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!
97: KING EDWARD IV: I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.
98: DERBY: I will not rise, unless your highness grant.
99: KING EDWARD IV: Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.
100: DERBY: The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
101: Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman
102: Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
103: KING EDWARD IV: Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,
104: And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
105: My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
106: And yet his punishment was cruel death.
107: Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,
108: Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
109: Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
110: Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
111: The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?
112: Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury
113: When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
114: And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?
115: Who told me, when we both lay in the field
116: Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
117: Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
118: All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
119: All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
120: Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
121: Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
122: But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
123: Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced
124: The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
125: You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
126: And I unjustly too, must grant it you
127: But for my brother not a man would speak,
128: Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
129: For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
130: Have been beholding to him in his life;
131: Yet none of you would once plead for his life.
132: O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
133: On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
134: Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.
135: Oh, poor Clarence!
136: GLOUCESTER: This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not
137: How that the guilty kindred of the queen
138: Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
139: O, they did urge it still unto the king!
140: God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
141: To comfort Edward with our company.
142: BUCKINGHAM: We wait upon your grace.
ACT 2 SCENE 2

1: Boy: Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?
2: DUCHESS OF YORK: No, boy.
3: Boy: Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,
4: And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'
5: Girl: Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
6: And call us wretches, orphans, castaways
7: If that our noble father be alive?
8: DUCHESS OF YORK: My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
9: I do lament the sickness of the king.
10: As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
11: It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
12: Boy: Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.
13: The king my uncle is to blame for this:
14: God will revenge it; whom I will importune
15: With daily prayers all to that effect.
16: Girl: And so will I.
17: DUCHESS OF YORK: Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:
18: Incapable and shallow innocents,
19: You cannot guess who caused your father's death.
20: Boy: Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
21: Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,
22: Devised impeachments to imprison him :
23: And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
24: And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
25: Bade me rely on him as on my father,
26: And he would love me dearly as his child.
27: DUCHESS OF YORK: Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
28: And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!
29: He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;
30: Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
31: Boy: Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
32: DUCHESS OF YORK: Ay, boy.
33: Boy: I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?
34: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
35: To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
36: I'll join with black despair against my soul,
37: And to myself become an enemy.
38: DUCHESS OF YORK: What means this scene of rude impatience?
39: QUEEN ELIZABETH: To make an act of tragic violence:
40: Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.
41: Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?
42: Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?
43: If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
44: That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;
45: Or, like obedient subjects, follow him
46: To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.
47: DUCHESS OF YORK: Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
48: As I had title in thy noble husband!
49: I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
50: And lived by looking on his images:
51: But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
52: Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
53: And I for comfort have but one false glass,
54: Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.
55: Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,
56: And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
57: But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,
58: And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,
59: Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
60: Thine being but a moiety of my grief,
61: To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!
62: Boy: Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;
63: How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
64: Girl: Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;
65: Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!
66: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Give me no help in lamentation;
67: I am not barren to bring forth complaints
68: All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,
69: That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
70: May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
71: Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!
72: Children: Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!
73: DUCHESS OF YORK: Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
74: QUEEN ELIZABETH: What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.
75: Children: What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.
76: DUCHESS OF YORK: What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
77: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Was never widow had so dear a loss!
78: Children: Were never orphans had so dear a loss!
79: DUCHESS OF YORK: Was never mother had so dear a loss!
80: Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
81: Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.
82: She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
83: I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:
84: These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;
85: I for an Edward weep, so do not they:
86: Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,
87: Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
88: And I will pamper it with lamentations.
89: DORSET: Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased
90: That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:
91: In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,
92: With dull unwilligness to repay a debt
93: Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
94: Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
95: For it requires the royal debt it lent you.
96: RIVERS: Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
97: Of the young prince your son: send straight for him
98: Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:
99: Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
100: And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
101: GLOUCESTER: Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause
102: To wail the dimming of our shining star;
103: But none can cure their harms by wailing them.
104: Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
105: I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee
106: I crave your blessing.
107: DUCHESS OF YORK: God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,
108: Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!
109: GLOUCESTER: [Aside] Amen; and make me die a good old man!
110: That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing:
111: I marvel why her grace did leave it out.
112: BUCKINGHAM: You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,
113: That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,
114: Now cheer each other in each other's love
115: Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
116: We are to reap the harvest of his son.
117: The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,
118: But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
119: Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:
120: Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,
121: Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd
122: Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.
123: RIVERS: Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?
124: BUCKINGHAM: Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,
125: The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
126: Which would be so much the more dangerous
127: By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:
128: Where every horse bears his commanding rein,
129: And may direct his course as please himself,
130: As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
131: In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
132: GLOUCESTER: I hope the king made peace with all of us
133: And the compact is firm and true in me.
134: RIVERS: And so in me; and so, I think, in all:
135: Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
136: To no apparent likelihood of breach,
137: Which haply by much company might be urged:
138: Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,
139: That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.
140: HASTINGS: And so say I.
141: GLOUCESTER: Then be it so; and go we to determine
142: Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
143: Madam, and you, my mother, will you go
144: To give your censures in this weighty business?
145: DUCHESS OF YORK: With all our harts.
146: BUCKINGHAM: My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
147: For God's sake, let not us two be behind;
148: For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,
149: As index to the story we late talk'd of,
150: To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.
151: GLOUCESTER: My other self, my counsel's consistory,
152: My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,
153: I, like a child, will go by thy direction.
154: Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.
ACT 2 SCENE 3

1: First Citizen: Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?
2: Second Citizen: I promise you, I scarcely know myself:
3: Hear you the news abroad?
4: First Citizen: Ay, that the king is dead.
5: Second Citizen: Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:
6: I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.
7: Third Citizen: Neighbours, God speed!
8: First Citizen: Give you good morrow, sir.
9: Third Citizen: Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?
10: Second Citizen: Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
11: Third Citizen: Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.
12: First Citizen: No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.
13: Third Citizen: Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!
14: Second Citizen: In him there is a hope of government,
15: That in his nonage council under him,
16: And in his full and ripen'd years himself,
17: No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.
18: First Citizen: So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
19: Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
20: Third Citizen: Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;
21: For then this land was famously enrich'd
22: With politic grave counsel; then the king
23: Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.
24: First Citizen: Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.
25: Third Citizen: Better it were they all came by the father,
26: Or by the father there were none at all;
27: For emulation now, who shall be nearest,
28: Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
29: O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
30: And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:
31: And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
32: This sickly land might solace as before.
33: First Citizen: Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.
34: Third Citizen: When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;
35: When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;
36: When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
37: Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
38: All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
39: 'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.
40: Second Citizen: Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:
41: Ye cannot reason almost with a man
42: That looks not heavily and full of fear.
43: Third Citizen: Before the times of change, still is it so:
44: By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
45: Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
46: The waters swell before a boisterous storm.
47: But leave it all to God. whither away?
48: Second Citizen: Marry, we were sent for to the justices.
49: Third Citizen: And so was I: I'll bear you company.
ACT 2 SCENE 4

1: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;
2: At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
3: To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.
4: DUCHESS OF YORK: I long with all my heart to see the prince:
5: I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
6: QUEEN ELIZABETH: But I hear, no; they say my son of York
7: Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.
8: YORK: Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
9: DUCHESS OF YORK: Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.
10: YORK: Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,
11: My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
12: More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle
13: Gloucester,
14: 'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
15: And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
16: Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.
17: DUCHESS OF YORK: Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
18: In him that did object the same to thee;
19: He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
20: So long a-growing and so leisurely,
21: That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.
22: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.
23: DUCHESS OF YORK: I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
24: YORK: Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,
25: I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,
26: To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.
27: DUCHESS OF YORK: How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.
28: YORK: Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
29: That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
30: 'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
31: Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
32: DUCHESS OF YORK: I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?
33: YORK: Grandam, his nurse.
34: DUCHESS OF YORK: His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.
35: YORK: If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
36: QUEEN ELIZABETH: A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.
37: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: Good madam, be not angry with the child.
38: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Pitchers have ears.
39: ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: Here comes a messenger. What news?
40: Messenger: Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.
41: QUEEN ELIZABETH: How fares the prince?
42: Messenger: Well, madam, and in health.
43: DUCHESS OF YORK: What is thy news then?
44: Messenger: Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,
45: With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.
46: DUCHESS OF YORK: Who hath committed them?
47: Messenger: The mighty dukes
48: Gloucester and Buckingham.
49: QUEEN ELIZABETH: For what offence?
50: Messenger: The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;
51: Why or for what these nobles were committed
52: Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.
53: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!
54: The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;
55: Insulting tyranny begins to jet
56: Upon the innocent and aweless throne:
57: Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!
58: I see, as in a map, the end of all.
59: DUCHESS OF YORK: Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
60: How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
61: My husband lost his life to get the crown;
62: And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
63: For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
64: And being seated, and domestic broils
65: Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.
66: Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,
67: Self against self: O, preposterous
68: And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
69: Or let me die, to look on death no more!
70: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.
71: Madam, farewell.
72: DUCHESS OF YORK: I'll go along with you.
73: QUEEN ELIZABETH: You have no cause.
ACT 3 SCENE 1

1: BUCKINGHAM: Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.
2: GLOUCESTER: Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
3: The weary way hath made you melancholy.
4: PRINCE EDWARD: No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
5: Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy
6: I want more uncles here to welcome me.
7: GLOUCESTER: Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
8: Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
9: Nor more can you distinguish of a man
10: Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
11: Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
12: Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
13: Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,
14: But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :
15: God keep you from them, and from such false friends!
16: PRINCE EDWARD: God keep me from false friends! but they were none.
17: GLOUCESTER: My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.
18: Lord Mayor: God bless your grace with health and happy days!
19: PRINCE EDWARD: I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.
20: I thought my mother, and my brother York,
21: Would long ere this have met us on the way
22: Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
23: To tell us whether they will come or no!
24: BUCKINGHAM: And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.
25: PRINCE EDWARD: Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?
26: HASTINGS: On what occasion, God he knows, not I,
27: The queen your mother, and your brother York,
28: Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
29: Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,
30: But by his mother was perforce withheld.
31: BUCKINGHAM: Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
32: Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace
33: Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
34: Unto his princely brother presently?
35: If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
36: And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.
37: CARDINAL: My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
38: Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
39: Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
40: To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
41: We should infringe the holy privilege
42: Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land
43: Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
44: BUCKINGHAM: You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,
45: Too ceremonious and traditional
46: Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
47: You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
48: The benefit thereof is always granted
49: To those whose dealings have deserved the place,
50: And those who have the wit to claim the place:
51: This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;
52: And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:
53: Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
54: You break no privilege nor charter there.
55: Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
56: But sanctuary children ne'er till now.
57: CARDINAL: My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.
58: Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
59: HASTINGS: I go, my lord.
60: PRINCE EDWARD: Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
61: Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
62: Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
63: GLOUCESTER: Where it seems best unto your royal self.
64: If I may counsel you, some day or two
65: Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:
66: Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
67: For your best health and recreation.
68: PRINCE EDWARD: I do not like the Tower, of any place.
69: Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
70: BUCKINGHAM: He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;
71: Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
72: PRINCE EDWARD: Is it upon record, or else reported
73: Successively from age to age, he built it?
74: BUCKINGHAM: Upon record, my gracious lord.
75: PRINCE EDWARD: But say, my lord, it were not register'd,
76: Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
77: As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
78: Even to the general all-ending day.
79: GLOUCESTER: [Aside] So wise so young, they say, do never
80: live long.
81: PRINCE EDWARD: What say you, uncle?
82: GLOUCESTER: I say, without characters, fame lives long.
83: Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
84: I moralize two meanings in one word.
85: PRINCE EDWARD: That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
86: With what his valour did enrich his wit,
87: His wit set down to make his valour live
88: Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
89: For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
90: I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--
91: BUCKINGHAM: What, my gracious lord?
92: PRINCE EDWARD: An if I live until I be a man,
93: I'll win our ancient right in France again,
94: Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.
95: GLOUCESTER: [Aside] Short summers lightly have a forward spring.
96: BUCKINGHAM: Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.
97: PRINCE EDWARD: Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?
98: YORK: Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.
99: PRINCE EDWARD: Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:
100: Too late he died that might have kept that title,
101: Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
102: GLOUCESTER: How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
103: YORK: I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
104: You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
105: The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
106: GLOUCESTER: He hath, my lord.
107: YORK: And therefore is he idle?
108: GLOUCESTER: O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
109: YORK: Then is he more beholding to you than I.
110: GLOUCESTER: He may command me as my sovereign;
111: But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
112: YORK: I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
113: GLOUCESTER: My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.
114: PRINCE EDWARD: A beggar, brother?
115: YORK: Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
116: And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
117: GLOUCESTER: A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
118: YORK: A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.
119: GLOUCESTER: A gentle cousin, were it light enough.
120: YORK: O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;
121: In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
122: GLOUCESTER: It is too heavy for your grace to wear.
123: YORK: I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
124: GLOUCESTER: What, would you have my weapon, little lord?
125: YORK: I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
126: GLOUCESTER: How?
127: YORK: Little.
128: PRINCE EDWARD: My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
129: Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.
130: YORK: You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
131: Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
132: Because that I am little, like an ape,
133: He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
134: BUCKINGHAM: With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
135: To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
136: He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
137: So cunning and so young is wonderful.
138: GLOUCESTER: My lord, will't please you pass along?
139: Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
140: Will to your mother, to entreat of her
141: To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
142: YORK: What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
143: PRINCE EDWARD: My lord protector needs will have it so.
144: YORK: I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
145: GLOUCESTER: Why, what should you fear?
146: YORK: Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:
147: My grandam told me he was murdered there.
148: PRINCE EDWARD: I fear no uncles dead.
149: GLOUCESTER: Nor none that live, I hope.
150: PRINCE EDWARD: An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
151: But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,
152: Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.
153: BUCKINGHAM: Think you, my lord, this little prating York
154: Was not incensed by his subtle mother
155: To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
156: GLOUCESTER: No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
157: Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable
158: He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.
159: BUCKINGHAM: Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
160: Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
161: As closely to conceal what we impart:
162: Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;
163: What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
164: To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
165: For the instalment of this noble duke
166: In the seat royal of this famous isle?
167: CATESBY: He for his father's sake so loves the prince,
168: That he will not be won to aught against him.
169: BUCKINGHAM: What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?
170: CATESBY: He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
171: BUCKINGHAM: Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
172: And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
173: How doth he stand affected to our purpose;
174: And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
175: To sit about the coronation.
176: If thou dost find him tractable to us,
177: Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:
178: If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
179: Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
180: And give us notice of his inclination:
181: For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
182: Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.
183: GLOUCESTER: Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
184: His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
185: To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;
186: And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,
187: Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.
188: BUCKINGHAM: Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.
189: CATESBY: My good lords both, with all the heed I may.
190: GLOUCESTER: Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
191: CATESBY: You shall, my lord.
192: GLOUCESTER: At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.
193: BUCKINGHAM: Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive
194: Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
195: GLOUCESTER: Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:
196: And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me
197: The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables
198: Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.
199: BUCKINGHAM: I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.
200: GLOUCESTER: And look to have it yielded with all willingness.
201: Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
202: We may digest our complots in some form.
ACT 3 SCENE 2

1: Messenger: What, ho! my lord!
2: HASTINGS: [Within] Who knocks at the door?
3: Messenger: A messenger from the Lord Stanley.
4: HASTINGS: What is't o'clock?
5: Messenger: Upon the stroke of four.
6: HASTINGS: Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?
7: Messenger: So it should seem by that I have to say.
8: First, he commends him to your noble lordship.
9: HASTINGS: And then?
10: Messenger: And then he sends you word
11: He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
12: Besides, he says there are two councils held;
13: And that may be determined at the one
14: which may make you and him to rue at the other.
15: Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,
16: If presently you will take horse with him,
17: And with all speed post with him toward the north,
18: To shun the danger that his soul divines.
19: HASTINGS: Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
20: Bid him not fear the separated councils
21: His honour and myself are at the one,
22: And at the other is my servant Catesby
23: Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
24: Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
25: Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:
26: And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond
27: To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
28: To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
29: Were to incense the boar to follow us
30: And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
31: Go, bid thy master rise and come to me
32: And we will both together to the Tower,
33: Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.
34: Messenger: My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.
35: CATESBY: Many good morrows to my noble lord!
36: HASTINGS: Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring
37: What news, what news, in this our tottering state?
38: CATESBY: It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;
39: And I believe twill never stand upright
40: Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.
41: HASTINGS: How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?
42: CATESBY: Ay, my good lord.
43: HASTINGS: I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
44: Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
45: But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
46: CATESBY: Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward
47: Upon his party for the gain thereof:
48: And thereupon he sends you this good news,
49: That this same very day your enemies,
50: The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.
51: HASTINGS: Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
52: Because they have been still mine enemies:
53: But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,
54: To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
55: God knows I will not do it, to the death.
56: CATESBY: God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
57: HASTINGS: But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
58: That they who brought me in my master's hate
59: I live to look upon their tragedy.
60: I tell thee, Catesby--
61: CATESBY: What, my lord?
62: HASTINGS: Ere a fortnight make me elder,
63: I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.
64: CATESBY: 'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
65: When men are unprepared and look not for it.
66: HASTINGS: O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
67: With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do
68: With some men else, who think themselves as safe
69: As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear
70: To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
71: CATESBY: The princes both make high account of you;
72: For they account his head upon the bridge.
73: HASTINGS: I know they do; and I have well deserved it.
74: Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
75: Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?
76: STANLEY: My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:
77: You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
78: I do not like these several councils, I.
79: HASTINGS: My lord,
80: I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
81: And never in my life, I do protest,
82: Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:
83: Think you, but that I know our state secure,
84: I would be so triumphant as I am?
85: STANLEY: The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
86: Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,
87: And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
88: But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.
89: This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:
90: Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
91: What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.
92: HASTINGS: Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
93: To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.
94: LORD STANLEY: They, for their truth, might better wear their heads
95: Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
96: But come, my lord, let us away.
97: HASTINGS: Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
98: How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?
99: Pursuivant: The better that your lordship please to ask.
100: HASTINGS: I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
101: Than when I met thee last where now we meet:
102: Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,
103: By the suggestion of the queen's allies;
104: But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--
105: This day those enemies are put to death,
106: And I in better state than e'er I was.
107: Pursuivant: God hold it, to your honour's good content!
108: HASTINGS: Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.
109: Pursuivant: God save your lordship!
110: Priest: Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.
111: HASTINGS: I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
112: I am in your debt for your last exercise;
113: Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.
114: BUCKINGHAM: What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?
115: Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;
116: Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.
117: HASTINGS: Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
118: Those men you talk of came into my mind.
119: What, go you toward the Tower?
120: BUCKINGHAM: I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay
121: I shall return before your lordship thence.
122: HASTINGS: 'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.
123: BUCKINGHAM: [Aside] And supper too, although thou know'st it not.
124: Come, will you go?
125: HASTINGS: I'll wait upon your lordship.
ACT 3 SCENE 3

1: RATCLIFF: Come, bring forth the prisoners.
2: RIVERS: Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
3: To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
4: For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.
5: GREY: God keep the prince from all the pack of you!
6: A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!
7: VAUGHAN: You live that shall cry woe for this after.
8: RATCLIFF: Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
9: RIVERS: O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
10: Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
11: Within the guilty closure of thy walls
12: Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
13: And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,
14: We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.
15: GREY: Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
16: For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.
17: RIVERS: Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,
18: Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God
19: To hear her prayers for them, as now for us
20: And for my sister and her princely sons,
21: Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
22: Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.
23: RATCLIFF: Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.
24: RIVERS: Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace:
25: And take our leave, until we meet in heaven.
ACT 3 SCENE 4

1: HASTINGS: My lords, at once: the cause why we are met
2: Is, to determine of the coronation.
3: In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?
4: BUCKINGHAM: Are all things fitting for that royal time?
5: DERBY: It is, and wants but nomination.
6: BISHOP OF ELY: To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.
7: BUCKINGHAM: Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?
8: Who is most inward with the royal duke?
9: BISHOP OF ELY: Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.
10: BUCKINGHAM: Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,
11: But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,
12: Than I of yours;
13: Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.
14: Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
15: HASTINGS: I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;
16: But, for his purpose in the coronation.
17: I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
18: His gracious pleasure any way therein:
19: But you, my noble lords, may name the time;
20: And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
21: Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.
22: BISHOP OF ELY: Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.
23: GLOUCESTER: My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
24: I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
25: My absence doth neglect no great designs,
26: Which by my presence might have been concluded.
27: BUCKINGHAM: Had not you come upon your cue, my lord
28: William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--
29: I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.
30: GLOUCESTER: Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;
31: His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.
32: HASTINGS: I thank your grace.
33: GLOUCESTER: My lord of Ely!
34: BISHOP OF ELY: My lord?
35: GLOUCESTER: When I was last in Holborn,
36: I saw good strawberries in your garden there
37: I do beseech you send for some of them.
38: BISHOP OF ELY: Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.
39: GLOUCESTER: Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
40: Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
41: And finds the testy gentleman so hot,
42: As he will lose his head ere give consent
43: His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,
44: Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.
45: BUCKINGHAM: Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.
46: DERBY: We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
47: To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;
48: For I myself am not so well provided
49: As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.
50: BISHOP OF ELY: Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these
51: strawberries.
52: HASTINGS: His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;
53: There's some conceit or other likes him well,
54: When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.
55: I think there's never a man in Christendom
56: That can less hide his love or hate than he;
57: For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
58: DERBY: What of his heart perceive you in his face
59: By any likelihood he show'd to-day?
60: HASTINGS: Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
61: For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.
62: DERBY: I pray God he be not, I say.
63: GLOUCESTER: I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
64: That do conspire my death with devilish plots
65: Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
66: Upon my body with their hellish charms?
67: HASTINGS: The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,
68: Makes me most forward in this noble presence
69: To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be
70: I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
71: GLOUCESTER: Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:
72: See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
73: Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:
74: And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
75: Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
76: That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
77: HASTINGS: If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--
78: GLOUCESTER: If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--
79: Tellest thou me of 'ifs'? Thou art a traitor:
80: Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,
81: I will not dine until I see the same.
82: Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:
83: The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.
84: HASTINGS: Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;
85: For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
86: Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
87: But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:
88: Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
89: And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,
90: As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
91: O, now I want the priest that spake to me:
92: I now repent I told the pursuivant
93: As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,
94: How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
95: And I myself secure in grace and favour.
96: O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
97: Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
98: RATCLIFF: Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:
99: Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.
100: HASTINGS: O momentary grace of mortal men,
101: Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
102: Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,
103: Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
104: Ready, with every nod, to tumble down
105: Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
106: LOVEL: Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.
107: HASTINGS: O bloody Richard! miserable England!
108: I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee
109: That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
110: Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.
111: They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.
ACT 3 SCENE 5

1: GLOUCESTER: Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,
2: Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,
3: And then begin again, and stop again,
4: As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?
5: BUCKINGHAM: Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
6: Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
7: Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
8: Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks
9: Are at my service, like enforced smiles;
10: And both are ready in their offices,
11: At any time, to grace my stratagems.
12: But what, is Catesby gone?
13: GLOUCESTER: He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.
14: BUCKINGHAM: Lord mayor,--
15: GLOUCESTER: Look to the drawbridge there!
16: BUCKINGHAM: Hark! a drum.
17: GLOUCESTER: Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
18: BUCKINGHAM: Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--
19: GLOUCESTER: Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.
20: BUCKINGHAM: God and our innocency defend and guard us!
21: GLOUCESTER: Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.
22: LOVEL: Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
23: The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
24: GLOUCESTER: So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
25: I took him for the plainest harmless creature
26: That breathed upon this earth a Christian;
27: Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
28: The history of all her secret thoughts:
29: So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
30: That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
31: I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,
32: He lived from all attainder of suspect.
33: BUCKINGHAM: Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
34: That ever lived.
35: Would you imagine, or almost believe,
36: Were't not that, by great preservation,
37: We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor
38: This day had plotted, in the council-house
39: To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?
40: Lord Mayor: What, had he so?
41: GLOUCESTER: What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
42: Or that we would, against the form of law,
43: Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,
44: But that the extreme peril of the case,
45: The peace of England and our persons' safety,
46: Enforced us to this execution?
47: Lord Mayor: Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;
48: And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,
49: To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
50: I never look'd for better at his hands,
51: After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
52: GLOUCESTER: Yet had not we determined he should die,
53: Until your lordship came to see his death;
54: Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
55: Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:
56: Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
57: The traitor speak, and timorously confess
58: The manner and the purpose of his treason;
59: That you might well have signified the same
60: Unto the citizens, who haply may
61: Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.
62: Lord Mayor: But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
63: As well as I had seen and heard him speak
64: And doubt you not, right noble princes both,
65: But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
66: With all your just proceedings in this cause.
67: GLOUCESTER: And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,
68: To avoid the carping censures of the world.
69: BUCKINGHAM: But since you come too late of our intents,
70: Yet witness what you hear we did intend:
71: And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.
72: GLOUCESTER: Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
73: The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
74: There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
75: Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
76: Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,
77: Only for saying he would make his son
78: Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
79: Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.
80: Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
81: And bestial appetite in change of lust;
82: Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,
83: Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,
84: Without control, listed to make his prey.
85: Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
86: Tell them, when that my mother went with child
87: Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York
88: My princely father then had wars in France
89: And, by just computation of the time,
90: Found that the issue was not his begot;
91: Which well appeared in his lineaments,
92: Being nothing like the noble duke my father:
93: But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,
94: Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.
95: BUCKINGHAM: Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator
96: As if the golden fee for which I plead
97: Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.
98: GLOUCESTER: If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;
99: Where you shall find me well accompanied
100: With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.
101: BUCKINGHAM: I go: and towards three or four o'clock
102: Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
103: GLOUCESTER: Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
104: Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both
105: Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
106: Now will I in, to take some privy order,
107: To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;
108: And to give notice, that no manner of person
109: At any time have recourse unto the princes.
ACT 3 SCENE 6

1: Scrivener: This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
2: Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,
3: That it may be this day read over in Paul's.
4: And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
5: Eleven hours I spent to write it over,
6: For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;
7: The precedent was full as long a-doing:
8: And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,
9: Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty
10: Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
11: That seeth not this palpable device?
12: Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?
13: Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,
14: When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.
ACT 3 SCENE 7

1: GLOUCESTER: How now, my lord, what say the citizens?
2: BUCKINGHAM: Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
3: The citizens are mum and speak not a word.
4: GLOUCESTER: Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?
5: BUCKINGHAM: I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
6: And his contract by deputy in France;
7: The insatiate greediness of his desires,
8: And his enforcement of the city wives;
9: His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
10: As being got, your father then in France,
11: His resemblance, being not like the duke;
12: Withal I did infer your lineaments,
13: Being the right idea of your father,
14: Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
15: Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
16: Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,
17: Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
18: Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose
19: Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse
20: And when mine oratory grew to an end
21: I bid them that did love their country's good
22: Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'
23: GLOUCESTER: Ah! and did they so?
24: BUCKINGHAM: No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
25: But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
26: Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
27: Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
28: And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
29: His answer was, the people were not wont
30: To be spoke to but by the recorder.
31: Then he was urged to tell my tale again,
32: 'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'
33: But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
34: When he had done, some followers of mine own,
35: At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
36: And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
37: And thus I took the vantage of those few,
38: 'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;
39: 'This general applause and loving shout
40: Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'
41: And even here brake off, and came away.
42: GLOUCESTER: What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?
43: BUCKINGHAM: No, by my troth, my lord.
44: GLOUCESTER: Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?
45: BUCKINGHAM: The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;
46: Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:
47: And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
48: And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;
49: For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:
50: And be not easily won to our request:
51: Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.
52: GLOUCESTER: I go; and if you plead as well for them
53: As I can say nay to thee for myself,
54: No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.
55: BUCKINGHAM: Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.
56: Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;
57: I think the duke will not be spoke withal.
58: Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,
59: What says he?
60: CATESBY: My lord: he doth entreat your grace;
61: To visit him to-morrow or next day:
62: He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
63: Divinely bent to meditation;
64: And no worldly suit would he be moved,
65: To draw him from his holy exercise.
66: BUCKINGHAM: Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;
67: Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,
68: In deep designs and matters of great moment,
69: No less importing than our general good,
70: Are come to have some conference with his grace.
71: CATESBY: I'll tell him what you say, my lord.
72: BUCKINGHAM: Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
73: He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,
74: But on his knees at meditation;
75: Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
76: But meditating with two deep divines;
77: Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
78: But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:
79: Happy were England, would this gracious prince
80: Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
81: But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.
82: Lord Mayor: Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!
83: BUCKINGHAM: I fear he will.
84: How now, Catesby, what says your lord?
85: CATESBY: My lord,
86: He wonders to what end you have assembled
87: Such troops of citizens to speak with him,
88: His grace not being warn'd thereof before:
89: My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.
90: BUCKINGHAM: Sorry I am my noble cousin should
91: Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:
92: By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;
93: And so once more return and tell his grace.
94: When holy and devout religious men
95: Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,
96: So sweet is zealous contemplation.
97: Lord Mayor: See, where he stands between two clergymen!
98: BUCKINGHAM: Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
99: To stay him from the fall of vanity:
100: And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
101: True ornaments to know a holy man.
102: Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
103: Lend favourable ears to our request;
104: And pardon us the interruption
105: Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
106: GLOUCESTER: My lord, there needs no such apology:
107: I rather do beseech you pardon me,
108: Who, earnest in the service of my God,
109: Neglect the visitation of my friends.
110: But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?
111: BUCKINGHAM: Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
112: And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.
113: GLOUCESTER: I do suspect I have done some offence
114: That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,
115: And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
116: BUCKINGHAM: You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,
117: At our entreaties, to amend that fault!
118: GLOUCESTER: Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
119: BUCKINGHAM: Then know, it is your fault that you resign
120: The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
121: The scepter'd office of your ancestors,
122: Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
123: The lineal glory of your royal house,
124: To the corruption of a blemished stock:
125: Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
126: Which here we waken to our country's good,
127: This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
128: Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
129: Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
130: And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
131: Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
132: Which to recure, we heartily solicit
133: Your gracious self to take on you the charge
134: And kingly government of this your land,
135: Not as protector, steward, substitute,
136: Or lowly factor for another's gain;
137: But as successively from blood to blood,
138: Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
139: For this, consorted with the citizens,
140: Your very worshipful and loving friends,
141: And by their vehement instigation,
142: In this just suit come I to move your grace.
143: GLOUCESTER: I know not whether to depart in silence,
144: Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.
145: Best fitteth my degree or your condition
146: If not to answer, you might haply think
147: Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
148: To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
149: Which fondly you would here impose on me;
150: If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
151: So season'd with your faithful love to me.
152: Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.
153: Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
154: And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
155: Definitively thus I answer you.
156: Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
157: Unmeritable shuns your high request.
158: First if all obstacles were cut away,
159: And that my path were even to the crown,
160: As my ripe revenue and due by birth
161: Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
162: So mighty and so many my defects,
163: As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
164: Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
165: Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
166: And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
167: But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,
168: And much I need to help you, if need were;
169: The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
170: Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
171: Will well become the seat of majesty,
172: And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
173: On him I lay what you would lay on me,
174: The right and fortune of his happy stars;
175: Which God defend that I should wring from him!
176: BUCKINGHAM: My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;
177: But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
178: All circumstances well considered.
179: You say that Edward is your brother's son:
180: So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
181: For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
182: Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
183: And afterward by substitute betroth'd
184: To Bona, sister to the King of France.
185: These both put by a poor petitioner,
186: A care-crazed mother of a many children,
187: A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
188: Even in the afternoon of her best days,
189: Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
190: Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
191: To base declension and loathed bigamy
192: By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
193: This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.
194: More bitterly could I expostulate,
195: Save that, for reverence to some alive,
196: I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
197: Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
198: This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
199: If non to bless us and the land withal,
200: Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
201: From the corruption of abusing times,
202: Unto a lineal true-derived course.
203: Lord Mayor: Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.
204: BUCKINGHAM: Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
205: CATESBY: O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!
206: GLOUCESTER: Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?
207: I am unfit for state and majesty;
208: I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
209: I cannot nor I will not yield to you.
210: BUCKINGHAM: If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,
211: Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;
212: As well we know your tenderness of heart
213: And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
214: Which we have noted in you to your kin,
215: And egally indeed to all estates,--
216: Yet whether you accept our suit or no,
217: Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
218: But we will plant some other in the throne,
219: To the disgrace and downfall of your house:
220: And in this resolution here we leave you.--
221: Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.
222: GLOUCESTER: O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.
223: CATESBY: Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.
224: ANOTHER: Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.
225: GLOUCESTER: Would you enforce me to a world of care?
226: Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,
227: But penetrable to your. kind entreats,
228: Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
229: Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,
230: Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
231: To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,
232: I must have patience to endure the load:
233: But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
234: Attend the sequel of your imposition,
235: Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
236: From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
237: For God he knows, and you may partly see,
238: How far I am from the desire thereof.
239: Lord Mayor: God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.
240: GLOUCESTER: In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
241: BUCKINGHAM: Then I salute you with this kingly title:
242: Long live Richard, England's royal king!
243: Citizens: Amen.
244: BUCKINGHAM: To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?
245: GLOUCESTER: Even when you please, since you will have it so.
246: BUCKINGHAM: To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:
247: And so most joyfully we take our leave.
ACT 4 SCENE 1

1: DUCHESS OF YORK: Who m eets us here? my niece Plantagenet
2: Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
3: Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
4: On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.
5: Daughter, well met.
6: LADY ANNE: God give your graces both
7: A happy and a joyful time of day!
8: QUEEN ELIZABETH: As much to you, good sister! Whither away?
9: LADY ANNE: No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,
10: Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
11: To gratulate the gentle princes there.
12: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.
13: And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
14: Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
15: How doth the prince, and my young son of York?
16: BRAKENBURY: Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
17: I may not suffer you to visit them;
18: The king hath straitly charged the contrary.
19: QUEEN ELIZABETH: The king! why, who's that?
20: BRAKENBURY: I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.
21: QUEEN ELIZABETH: The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
22: Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?
23: I am their mother; who should keep me from them?
24: DUCHESS OF YORK: I am their fathers mother; I will see them.
25: LADY ANNE: Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:
26: Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame
27: And take thy office from thee, on my peril.
28: BRAKENBURY: No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:
29: I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.
30: LORD STANLEY: Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,
31: And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,
32: And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.
33: Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,
34: There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.
35: QUEEN ELIZABETH: O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
36: May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon
37: With this dead-killing news!
38: LADY ANNE: Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!
39: DORSET: Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?
40: QUEEN ELIZABETH: O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!
41: Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;
42: Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
43: If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
44: And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell
45: Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
46: Lest thou increase the number of the dead;
47: And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
48: Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.
49: LORD STANLEY: Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
50: Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
51: You shall have letters from me to my son
52: To meet you on the way, and welcome you.
53: Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
54: DUCHESS OF YORK: O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
55: O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
56: A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
57: Whose unavoided eye is murderous.
58: LORD STANLEY: Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.
59: LADY ANNE: And I in all unwillingness will go.
60: I would to God that the inclusive verge
61: Of golden metal that must round my brow
62: Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!
63: Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
64: And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!
65: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory
66: To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.
67: LADY ANNE: No! why? When he that is my husband now
68: Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
69: When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
70: Which issued from my other angel husband
71: And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;
72: O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
73: This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,
74: For making me, so young, so old a widow!
75: And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
76: And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
77: As miserable by the life of thee
78: As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!
79: Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
80: Even in so short a space, my woman's heart
81: Grossly grew captive to his honey words
82: And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,
83: Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;
84: For never yet one hour in his bed
85: Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
86: But have been waked by his timorous dreams.
87: Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
88: And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.
89: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.
90: LADY ANNE: No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
91: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!
92: LADY ANNE: Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!
93: DUCHESS OF YORK: [To DORSET]
94: Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee!
95: Go thou to Richard, and good angels guard thee!
96: Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee!
97: I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!
98: Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
99: And each hour's joy wrecked with a week of teen.
100: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.
101: Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
102: Whom envy hath immured within your walls!
103: Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
104: Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
105: For tender princes, use my babies well!
106: So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.
ACT 4 SCENE 2

1: KING RICHARD III: Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!
2: BUCKINGHAM: My gracious sovereign?
3: KING RICHARD III: Give me thy hand.
4: Thus high, by thy advice
5: And thy assistance, is King Richard seated;
6: But shall we wear these honours for a day?
7: Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?
8: BUCKINGHAM: Still live they and for ever may they last!
9: KING RICHARD III: O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
10: To try if thou be current gold indeed
11: Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.
12: BUCKINGHAM: Say on, my loving lord.
13: KING RICHARD III: Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,
14: BUCKINGHAM: Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.
15: KING RICHARD III: Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
16: BUCKINGHAM: True, noble prince.
17: KING RICHARD III: O bitter consequence,
18: That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'
19: Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:
20: Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;
21: And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
22: What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief.
23: BUCKINGHAM: Your grace may do your pleasure.
24: KING RICHARD III: Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth:
25: Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?
26: BUCKINGHAM: Give me some breath, some little pause, my lord
27: Before I positively herein:
28: I will resolve your grace immediately.
29: CATESBY: [Aside to a stander by]
30: The king is angry: see, he bites the lip.
31: KING RICHARD III: I will converse with iron-witted fools
32: And unrespective boys: none are for me
33: That look into me with considerate eyes:
34: High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
35: Boy!
36: Page: My lord?
37: KING RICHARD III: Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
38: Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?
39: Page: My lord, I know a discontented gentleman,
40: Whose humble means match not his haughty mind:
41: Gold were as good as twenty orators,
42: And will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing.
43: KING RICHARD III: What is his name?
44: Page: His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
45: KING RICHARD III: I partly know the man: go, call him hither.
46: The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
47: No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel:
48: Hath he so long held out with me untired,
49: And stops he now for breath?
50: How now! what news with you?
51: STANLEY: My lord, I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled
52: To Richmond, in those parts beyond the sea
53: Where he abides.
54: KING RICHARD III: Catesby!
55: CATESBY: My lord?
56: KING RICHARD III: Rumour it abroad
57: That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:
58: I will take order for her keeping close.
59: Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,
60: Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:
61: The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
62: Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
63: That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:
64: About it; for it stands me much upon,
65: To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
66: I must be married to my brother's daughter,
67: Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
68: Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
69: Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
70: So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:
71: Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
72: Is thy name Tyrrel?
73: TYRREL: James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.
74: KING RICHARD III: Art thou, indeed?
75: TYRREL: Prove me, my gracious sovereign.
76: KING RICHARD III: Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
77: TYRREL: Ay, my lord;
78: But I had rather kill two enemies.
79: KING RICHARD III: Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,
80: Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers
81: Are they that I would have thee deal upon:
82: Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
83: TYRREL: Let me have open means to come to them,
84: And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
85: KING RICHARD III: Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel
86: Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:
87: There is no more but so: say it is done,
88: And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.
89: TYRREL: 'Tis done, my gracious lord.
90: KING RICHARD III: Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?
91: TYRREL: Ye shall, my Lord.
92: BUCKINGHAM: My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind
93: The late demand that you did sound me in.
94: KING RICHARD III: Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.
95: BUCKINGHAM: I hear that news, my lord.
96: KING RICHARD III: Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it.
97: BUCKINGHAM: My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,
98: For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;
99: The earldom of Hereford and the moveables
100: The which you promised I should possess.
101: KING RICHARD III: Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey
102: Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
103: BUCKINGHAM: What says your highness to my just demand?
104: KING RICHARD III: As I remember, Henry the Sixth
105: Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
106: When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
107: A king, perhaps, perhaps,--
108: BUCKINGHAM: My lord!
109: KING RICHARD III: How chance the prophet could not at that time
110: Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
111: BUCKINGHAM: My lord, your promise for the earldom,--
112: KING RICHARD III: Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
113: The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,
114: And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,
115: Because a bard of Ireland told me once
116: I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
117: BUCKINGHAM: My Lord!
118: KING RICHARD III: Ay, what's o'clock?
119: BUCKINGHAM: I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
120: Of what you promised me.
121: KING RICHARD III: Well, but what's o'clock?
122: BUCKINGHAM: Upon the stroke of ten.
123: KING RICHARD III: Well, let it strike.
124: BUCKINGHAM: Why let it strike?
125: KING RICHARD III: Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke
126: Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
127: I am not in the giving vein to-day.
128: BUCKINGHAM: Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.
129: KING RICHARD III: Tut, tut,
130: Thou troublest me; am not in the vein.
131: BUCKINGHAM: Is it even so? rewards he my true service
132: With such deep contempt made I him king for this?
133: O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
134: To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!
ACT 4 SCENE 3

1: TYRREL: The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.
2: The most arch of piteous massacre
3: That ever yet this land was guilty of.
4: Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn
5: To do this ruthless piece of butchery,
6: Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
7: Melting with tenderness and kind compassion
8: Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.
9: 'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'
10: 'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another
11: Within their innocent alabaster arms:
12: Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
13: Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
14: A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
15: Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;
16: But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd
17: Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
18: The most replenished sweet work of nature,
19: That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'
20: Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;
21: They could not speak; and so I left them both,
22: To bring this tidings to the bloody king.
23: And here he comes.
24: All hail, my sovereign liege!
25: KING RICHARD III: Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
26: TYRREL: If to have done the thing you gave in charge
27: Beget your happiness, be happy then,
28: For it is done, my lord.
29: KING RICHARD III: But didst thou see them dead?
30: TYRREL: I did, my lord.
31: KING RICHARD III: And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
32: TYRREL: The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
33: But how or in what place I do not know.
34: KING RICHARD III: Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
35: And thou shalt tell the process of their death.
36: Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
37: And be inheritor of thy desire.
38: Farewell till soon.
39: The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
40: His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
41: The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
42: And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.
43: Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
44: At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
45: And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,
46: To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.
47: CATESBY: My lord!
48: KING RICHARD III: Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?
49: CATESBY: Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;
50: And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
51: Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.
52: KING RICHARD III: Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
53: Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
54: Come, I have heard that fearful commenting
55: Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
56: Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
57: Then fiery expedition be my wing,
58: Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
59: Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;
60: We must be brief when traitors brave the field.
ACT 4 SCENE 4

1: QUEEN MARGARET: So, now prosperity begins to mellow
2: And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
3: Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,
4: To watch the waning of mine adversaries.
5: A dire induction am I witness to,
6: And will to France, hoping the consequence
7: Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
8: Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?
9: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!
10: My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
11: If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
12: And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
13: Hover about me with your airy wings
14: And hear your mother's lamentation!
15: QUEEN MARGARET: Hover about her; say, that right for right
16: Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.
17: DUCHESS OF YORK: So many miseries have crazed my voice,
18: That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,
19: Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
20: QUEEN MARGARET: Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.
21: Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
22: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,
23: And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
24: When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?
25: QUEEN MARGARET: When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.
26: DUCHESS OF YORK: Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
27: Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
28: Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
29: Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
30: Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!
31: QUEEN ELIZABETH: O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
32: As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
33: Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
34: O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?
35: QUEEN MARGARET: If ancient sorrow be most reverend,
36: Give mine the benefit of seniory,
37: And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
38: If sorrow can admit society,
39: Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:
40: I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
41: I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:
42: Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
43: Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;
44: DUCHESS OF YORK: I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
45: I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.
46: QUEEN MARGARET: Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.
47: From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
48: A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:
49: That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
50: To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
51: That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
52: That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
53: That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
54: Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.
55: O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
56: How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur
57: Preys on the issue of his mother's body,
58: And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!
59: DUCHESS OF YORK: O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
60: God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
61: QUEEN MARGARET: Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
62: And now I cloy me with beholding it.
63: Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:
64: Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
65: Young York he is but boot, because both they
66: Match not the high perfection of my loss:
67: Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;
68: And the beholders of this tragic play,
69: The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
70: Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
71: Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
72: Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
73: And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,
74: Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:
75: Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.
76: To have him suddenly convey'd away.
77: Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,
78: That I may live to say, The dog is dead!
79: QUEEN ELIZABETH: O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
80: That I should wish for thee to help me curse
81: That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!
82: QUEEN MARGARET: I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
83: I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;
84: The presentation of but what I was;
85: The flattering index of a direful pageant;
86: One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;
87: A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;
88: A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
89: A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
90: To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
91: A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
92: Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
93: Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?
94: Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?
95: Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
96: Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?
97: Decline all this, and see what now thou art:
98: For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
99: For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
100: For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;
101: For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;
102: For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
103: For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;
104: For one commanding all, obey'd of none.
105: Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,
106: And left thee but a very prey to time;
107: Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
108: To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
109: Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
110: Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
111: Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
112: From which even here I slip my weary neck,
113: And leave the burthen of it all on thee.
114: Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:
115: These English woes will make me smile in France.
116: QUEEN ELIZABETH: O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
117: And teach me how to curse mine enemies!
118: QUEEN MARGARET: Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
119: Compare dead happiness with living woe;
120: Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,
121: And he that slew them fouler than he is:
122: Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:
123: Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
124: QUEEN ELIZABETH: My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!
125: QUEEN MARGARET: Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.
126: DUCHESS OF YORK: Why should calamity be full of words?
127: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Windy attorneys to their client woes,
128: Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
129: Poor breathing orators of miseries!
130: Let them have scope: though what they do impart
131: Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.
132: DUCHESS OF YORK: If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.
133: And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
134: My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.
135: I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.
136: KING RICHARD III: Who intercepts my expedition?
137: DUCHESS OF YORK: O, she that might have intercepted thee,
138: By strangling thee in her accursed womb
139: From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!
140: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,
141: Where should be graven, if that right were right,
142: The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,
143: And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?
144: Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?
145: DUCHESS OF YORK: Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
146: And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?
147: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?
148: KING RICHARD III: A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
149: Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
150: Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!
151: Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
152: Or with the clamorous report of war
153: Thus will I drown your exclamations.
154: DUCHESS OF YORK: Art thou my son?
155: KING RICHARD III: Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
156: DUCHESS OF YORK: Then patiently hear my impatience.
157: KING RICHARD III: Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
158: Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.
159: DUCHESS OF YORK: O, let me speak!
160: KING RICHARD III: Do then: but I'll not hear.
161: DUCHESS OF YORK: I will be mild and gentle in my speech.
162: KING RICHARD III: And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.
163: DUCHESS OF YORK: Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
164: God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.
165: KING RICHARD III: And came I not at last to comfort you?
166: DUCHESS OF YORK: No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
167: Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.
168: A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
169: Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
170: Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
171: Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
172: Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,
173: treacherous,
174: More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
175: What comfortable hour canst thou name,
176: That ever graced me in thy company?
177: KING RICHARD III: Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd
178: your grace
179: To breakfast once forth of my company.
180: If I be so disgracious in your sight,
181: Let me march on, and not offend your grace.
182: Strike the drum.
183: DUCHESS OF YORK: I prithee, hear me speak.
184: KING RICHARD III: You speak too bitterly.
185: DUCHESS OF YORK: Hear me a word;
186: For I shall never speak to thee again.
187: KING RICHARD III: So.
188: DUCHESS OF YORK: Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
189: Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
190: Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
191: And never look upon thy face again.
192: Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;
193: Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more
194: Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
195: My prayers on the adverse party fight;
196: And there the little souls of Edward's children
197: Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
198: And promise them success and victory.
199: Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
200: Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.
201: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse
202: Abides in me; I say amen to all.
203: KING RICHARD III: Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.
204: QUEEN ELIZABETH: I have no more sons of the royal blood
205: For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,
206: They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
207: And therefore level not to hit their lives.
208: KING RICHARD III: You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,
209: Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
210: QUEEN ELIZABETH: And must she die for this? O, let her live,
211: And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
212: Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
213: Throw over her the veil of infamy:
214: So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
215: I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
216: KING RICHARD III: Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.
217: QUEEN ELIZABETH: To save her life, I'll say she is not so.
218: KING RICHARD III: Her life is only safest in her birth.
219: QUEEN ELIZABETH: And only in that safety died her brothers.
220: KING RICHARD III: Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.
221: QUEEN ELIZABETH: No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
222: KING RICHARD III: All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
223: QUEEN ELIZABETH: True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
224: My babes were destined to a fairer death,
225: If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.
226: KING RICHARD III: You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
227: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd
228: Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
229: Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,
230: Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:
231: No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
232: Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
233: To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
234: But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
235: My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
236: Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
237: And I, in such a desperate bay of death,
238: Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
239: Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
240: KING RICHARD III: Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
241: And dangerous success of bloody wars,
242: As I intend more good to you and yours,
243: Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!
244: QUEEN ELIZABETH: What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,
245: To be discover'd, that can do me good?
246: KING RICHARD III: The advancement of your children, gentle lady.
247: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
248: KING RICHARD III: No, to the dignity and height of honour
249: The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
250: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
251: Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
252: Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
253: KING RICHARD III: Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,
254: Will I withal endow a child of thine;
255: So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
256: Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
257: Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
258: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness
259: Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
260: KING RICHARD III: Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.
261: QUEEN ELIZABETH: My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.
262: KING RICHARD III: What do you think?
263: QUEEN ELIZABETH: That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
264: So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;
265: And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
266: KING RICHARD III: Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
267: I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,
268: And mean to make her queen of England.
269: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?
270: KING RICHARD III: Even he that makes her queen who should be else?
271: QUEEN ELIZABETH: What, thou?
272: KING RICHARD III: I, even I: what think you of it, madam?
273: QUEEN ELIZABETH: How canst thou woo her?
274: KING RICHARD III: That would I learn of you,
275: As one that are best acquainted with her humour.
276: QUEEN ELIZABETH: And wilt thou learn of me?
277: KING RICHARD III: Madam, with all my heart.
278: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
279: A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave
280: Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
281: Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret
282: Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--
283: A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
284: The purple sap from her sweet brother's body
285: And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
286: If this inducement force her not to love,
287: Send her a story of thy noble acts;
288: Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,
289: Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
290: Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
291: KING RICHARD III: Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way
292: To win our daughter.
293: QUEEN ELIZABETH: There is no other way
294: Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
295: And not be Richard that hath done all this.
296: KING RICHARD III: Say that I did all this for love of her.
297: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
298: Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
299: KING RICHARD III: Look, what is done cannot be now amended:
300: Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
301: Which after hours give leisure to repent.
302: If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
303: To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.
304: If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
305: To quicken your increase, I will beget
306: Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
307: A grandam's name is little less in love
308: Than is the doting title of a mother;
309: They are as children but one step below,
310: Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
311: Of an one pain, save for a night of groans
312: Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
313: Your children were vexation to your youth,
314: But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
315: The loss you have is but a son being king,
316: And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
317: I cannot make you what amends I would,
318: Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
319: Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
320: Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
321: This fair alliance quickly shall call home
322: To high promotions and great dignity:
323: The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.
324: Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
325: Again shall you be mother to a king,
326: And all the ruins of distressful times
327: Repair'd with double riches of content.
328: What! we have many goodly days to see:
329: The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
330: Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
331: Advantaging their loan with interest
332: Of ten times double gain of happiness.
333: Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go
334: Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
335: Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
336: Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
337: Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
338: With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
339: And when this arm of mine hath chastised
340: The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
341: Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
342: And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
343: To whom I will retail my conquest won,
344: And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.
345: QUEEN ELIZABETH: What were I best to say? her father's brother
346: Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?
347: Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
348: Under what title shall I woo for thee,
349: That God, the law, my honour and her love,
350: Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
351: KING RICHARD III: Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
352: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.
353: KING RICHARD III: Say that the king, which may command, entreats.
354: QUEEN ELIZABETH: That at her hands which the king's King forbids.
355: KING RICHARD III: Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.
356: QUEEN ELIZABETH: To wail the tide, as her mother doth.
357: KING RICHARD III: Say, I will love her everlastingly.
358: QUEEN ELIZABETH: But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
359: KING RICHARD III: Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
360: QUEEN ELIZABETH: But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?
361: KING RICHARD III: So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
362: QUEEN ELIZABETH: So long as hell and Richard likes of it.
363: KING RICHARD III: Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.
364: QUEEN ELIZABETH: But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.
365: KING RICHARD III: Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
366: QUEEN ELIZABETH: An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.
367: KING RICHARD III: Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.
368: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
369: KING RICHARD III: Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
370: QUEEN ELIZABETH: O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;
371: Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.
372: KING RICHARD III: Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
373: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.
374: KING RICHARD III: Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--
375: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.
376: KING RICHARD III: I swear--
377: QUEEN ELIZABETH: By nothing; for this is no oath:
378: The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;
379: The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
380: The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.
381: if something thou wilt swear to be believed,
382: Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.
383: KING RICHARD III: Now, by the world--
384: QUEEN ELIZABETH: 'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
385: KING RICHARD III: My father's death--
386: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Thy life hath that dishonour'd.
387: KING RICHARD III: Then, by myself--
388: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Thyself thyself misusest.
389: KING RICHARD III: Why then, by God--
390: QUEEN ELIZABETH: God's wrong is most of all.
391: If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
392: The unity the king thy brother made
393: Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:
394: If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
395: The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,
396: Had graced the tender temples of my child,
397: And both the princes had been breathing here,
398: Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,
399: Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
400: What canst thou swear by now?
401: KING RICHARD III: The time to come.
402: QUEEN ELIZABETH: That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;
403: For I myself have many tears to wash
404: Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
405: The children live, whose parents thou hast
406: slaughter'd,
407: Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
408: The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,
409: Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.
410: Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
411: Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.
412: KING RICHARD III: As I intend to prosper and repent,
413: So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
414: Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
415: Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
416: Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
417: Be opposite all planets of good luck
418: To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,
419: Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
420: I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!
421: In her consists my happiness and thine;
422: Without her, follows to this land and me,
423: To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,
424: Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
425: It cannot be avoided but by this;
426: It will not be avoided but by this.
427: Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--
428: Be the attorney of my love to her:
429: Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
430: Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
431: Urge the necessity and state of times,
432: And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
433: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
434: KING RICHARD III: Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.
435: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Shall I forget myself to be myself?
436: KING RICHARD III: Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.
437: QUEEN ELIZABETH: But thou didst kill my children.
438: KING RICHARD III: But in your daughter's womb I bury them:
439: Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
440: Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.
441: QUEEN ELIZABETH: Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
442: KING RICHARD III: And be a happy mother by the deed.
443: QUEEN ELIZABETH: I go. Write to me very shortly.
444: And you shall understand from me her mind.
445: KING RICHARD III: Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
446: Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!
447: How now! what news?
448: RATCLIFF: My gracious sovereign, on the western coast
449: Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
450: Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
451: Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
452: 'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
453: And there they hull, expecting but the aid
454: Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.
455: KING RICHARD III: Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:
456: Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?
457: CATESBY: Here, my lord.
458: KING RICHARD III: Fly to the duke:
459: Post thou to Salisbury
460: When thou comest thither--
461: Dull, unmindful villain,
462: Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?
463: CATESBY: First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,
464: What from your grace I shall deliver to him.
465: KING RICHARD III: O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight
466: The greatest strength and power he can make,
467: And meet me presently at Salisbury.
468: CATESBY: I go.
469: RATCLIFF: What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at
470: Salisbury?
471: KING RICHARD III: Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?
472: RATCLIFF: Your highness told me I should post before.
473: KING RICHARD III: My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.
474: How now, what news with you?
475: STANLEY: None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;
476: Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.
477: KING RICHARD III: Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
478: Why dost thou run so many mile about,
479: When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?
480: Once more, what news?
481: STANLEY: Richmond is on the seas.
482: KING RICHARD III: There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
483: White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?
484: STANLEY: I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
485: KING RICHARD III: Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?
486: STANLEY: Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,
487: He makes for England, there to claim the crown.
488: KING RICHARD III: Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?
489: Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?
490: What heir of York is there alive but we?
491: And who is England's king but great York's heir?
492: Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?
493: STANLEY: Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
494: KING RICHARD III: Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
495: You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
496: Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.
497: STANLEY: No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.
498: KING RICHARD III: Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
499: Where are thy tenants and thy followers?
500: Are they not now upon the western shore.
501: Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!
502: STANLEY: No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
503: KING RICHARD III: Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,
504: When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
505: STANLEY: They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:
506: Please it your majesty to give me leave,
507: I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace
508: Where and what time your majesty shall please.
509: KING RICHARD III: Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:
510: I will not trust you, sir.
511: STANLEY: Most mighty sovereign,
512: You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:
513: I never was nor never will be false.
514: KING RICHARD III: Well,
515: Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
516: Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm.
517: Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
518: STANLEY: So deal with him as I prove true to you.
519: Messenger: My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,
520: As I by friends am well advertised,
521: Sir Edward Courtney, and the haughty prelate
522: Bishop of Exeter, his brother there,
523: With many more confederates, are in arms.
524: Second Messenger: My liege, in Kent the Guildfords are in arms;
525: And every hour more competitors
526: Flock to their aid, and still their power increaseth.
527: Third Messenger: My lord, the army of the Duke of Buckingham--
528: KING RICHARD III: Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death?
529: Take that, until thou bring me better news.
530: Third Messenger: The news I have to tell your majesty
531: Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters,
532: Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd;
533: And he himself wander'd away alone,
534: No man knows whither.
535: KING RICHARD III: I cry thee mercy:
536: There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
537: Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
538: Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
539: Third Messenger: Such proclamation hath been made, my liege.
540: Fourth Messenger: Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset,
541: 'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
542: Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace,
543: The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest:
544: Richmond, in Yorkshire, sent out a boat
545: Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
546: If they were his assistants, yea or no;
547: Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingham.
548: Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,
549: Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany.
550: KING RICHARD III: March on, march on, since we are up in arms;
551: If not to fight with foreign enemies,
552: Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.
553: CATESBY: My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken;
554: That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond
555: Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,
556: Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.
557: KING RICHARD III: Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,
558: A royal battle might be won and lost
559: Some one take order Buckingham be brought
560: To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.
ACT 4 SCENE 5

1: DERBY: Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
2: That in the sty of this most bloody boar
3: My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:
4: If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
5: The fear of that withholds my present aid.
6: But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?
7: CHRISTOPHER: At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.
8: DERBY: What men of name resort to him?
9: CHRISTOPHER: Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
10: Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley;
11: Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
12: And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew;
13: And many more of noble fame and worth:
14: And towards London they do bend their course,
15: If by the way they be not fought withal.
ACT 5 SCENE 1

1: BUCKINGHAM: Will not King Richard let me speak with him?
2: Sheriff: No, my good lord; therefore be patient.
3: BUCKINGHAM: Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey,
4: Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
5: Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
6: By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
7: If that your moody discontented souls
8: Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
9: Even for revenge mock my destruction!
10: This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not?
11: Sheriff: It is, my lord.
12: BUCKINGHAM: Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday.
13: This is the day that, in King Edward's time,
14: I wish't might fall on me, when I was found
15: False to his children or his wife's allies
16: This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
17: By the false faith of him I trusted most;
18: This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
19: Is the determined respite of my wrongs:
20: That high All-Seer that I dallied with
21: Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
22: And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
23: Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
24: To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:
25: Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;
26: 'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,
27: Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'
28: Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;
29: Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.
ACT 5 SCENE 2

1: RICHMOND: Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
2: Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,
3: Thus far into the bowels of the land
4: Have we march'd on without impediment;
5: And here receive we from our father Stanley
6: Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
7: The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
8: That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
9: Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
10: In your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swine
11: Lies now even in the centre of this isle,
12: Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
13: From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.
14: In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,
15: To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
16: By this one bloody trial of sharp war.
17: OXFORD: Every man's conscience is a thousand swords,
18: To fight against that bloody homicide.
19: HERBERT: I doubt not but his friends will fly to us.
20: BLUNT: He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.
21: Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.
22: RICHMOND: All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, march:
23: True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:
24: Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.
ACT 5 SCENE 3

1: KING RICHARD III: Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field.
2: My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?
3: SURREY: My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
4: KING RICHARD III: My Lord of Norfolk,--
5: NORFOLK: Here, most gracious liege.
6: KING RICHARD III: Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?
7: NORFOLK: We must both give and take, my gracious lord.
8: KING RICHARD III: Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight;
9: But where to-morrow? Well, all's one for that.
10: Who hath descried the number of the foe?
11: NORFOLK: Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.
12: KING RICHARD III: Why, our battalion trebles that account:
13: Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,
14: Which they upon the adverse party want.
15: Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,
16: Let us survey the vantage of the field
17: Call for some men of sound direction
18: Let's want no discipline, make no delay,
19: For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.
20: RICHMOND: The weary sun hath made a golden set,
21: And by the bright track of his fiery car,
22: Gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow.
23: Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.
24: Give me some ink and paper in my tent
25: I'll draw the form and model of our battle,
26: Limit each leader to his several charge,
27: And part in just proportion our small strength.
28: My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,
29: And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.
30: The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment:
31: Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him
32: And by the second hour in the morning
33: Desire the earl to see me in my tent:
34: Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,
35: Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?
36: BLUNT: Unless I have mista'en his colours much,
37: Which well I am assured I have not done,
38: His regiment lies half a mile at least
39: South from the mighty power of the king.
40: RICHMOND: If without peril it be possible,
41: Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,
42: And give him from me this most needful scroll.
43: BLUNT: Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it;
44: And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!
45: RICHMOND: Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gentlemen,
46: Let us consult upon to-morrow's business
47: In to our tent; the air is raw and cold.
48: KING RICHARD III: What is't o'clock?
49: CATESBY: It's supper-time, my lord;
50: It's nine o'clock.
51: KING RICHARD III: I will not sup to-night.
52: Give me some ink and paper.
53: What, is my beaver easier than it was?
54: And all my armour laid into my tent?
55: CATESBY: If is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.
56: KING RICHARD III: Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
57: Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.
58: NORFOLK: I go, my lord.
59: KING RICHARD III: Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.
60: NORFOLK: I warrant you, my lord.
61: KING RICHARD III: Catesby!
62: CATESBY: My lord?
63: KING RICHARD III: Send out a pursuivant at arms
64: To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
65: Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
66: Into the blind cave of eternal night.
67: Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
68: Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
69: Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
70: Ratcliff!
71: RATCLIFF: My lord?
72: KING RICHARD III: Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?
73: RATCLIFF: Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself,
74: Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
75: Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.
76: KING RICHARD III: So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:
77: I have not that alacrity of spirit,
78: Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.
79: Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?
80: RATCLIFF: It is, my lord.
81: KING RICHARD III: Bid my guard watch; leave me.
82: Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent
83: And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.
84: DERBY: Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
85: RICHMOND: All comfort that the dark night can afford
86: Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!
87: Tell me, how fares our loving mother?
88: DERBY: I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother
89: Who prays continually for Richmond's good:
90: So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
91: And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
92: In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--
93: Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
94: And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
95: Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
96: I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,--
97: With best advantage will deceive the time,
98: And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:
99: But on thy side I may not be too forward
100: Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
101: Be executed in his father's sight.
102: Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
103: Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
104: And ample interchange of sweet discourse,
105: Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon:
106: God give us leisure for these rites of love!
107: Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!
108: RICHMOND: Good lords, conduct him to his regiment:
109: I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,
110: Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,
111: When I should mount with wings of victory:
112: Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
113: O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
114: Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
115: Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,
116: That they may crush down with a heavy fall
117: The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
118: Make us thy ministers of chastisement,
119: That we may praise thee in the victory!
120: To thee I do commend my watchful soul,
121: Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
122: Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!
123: Ghost
124: of Prince Edward: [To KING RICHARD III]
125: Let me sit heavy on thy soul to-morrow!
126: Think, how thou stab'dst me in my prime of youth
127: At Tewksbury: despair, therefore, and die!
128: Be cheerful, Richmond; for the wronged souls
129: Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf
130: King Henry's issue, Richmond, comforts thee.
131: Ghost
132: of King Henry VI: [To KING RICHARD III]
133: When I was mortal, my anointed body
134: By thee was punched full of deadly holes
135: Think on the Tower and me: despair, and die!
136: Harry the Sixth bids thee despair, and die!
137: Virtuous and holy, be thou conqueror!
138: Harry, that prophesied thou shouldst be king,
139: Doth comfort thee in thy sleep: live, and flourish!
140: Ghost of CLARENCE: [To KING RICHARD III]
141: Let me sit heavy on thy soul to-morrow!
142: I, that was wash'd to death with fulsome wine,
143: Poor Clarence, by thy guile betrayed to death!
144: To-morrow in the battle think on me,
145: And fall thy edgeless sword: despair, and die!--
146: Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster
147: The wronged heirs of York do pray for thee
148: Good angels guard thy battle! live, and flourish!
149: Ghost of RIVERS: [To KING RICHARD III]
150: Let me sit heavy on thy soul to-morrow,
151: Rivers. that died at Pomfret! despair, and die!
152: Ghost of GREY: [To KING RICHARD III]
153: Think upon Grey, and let thy soul despair!
154: Ghost of VAUGHAN: [To KING RICHARD III]
155: Think upon Vaughan, and, with guilty fear,
156: Let fall thy lance: despair, and die!
157: All: [To RICHMOND]
158: Awake, and think our wrongs in Richard's bosom
159: Will conquer him! awake, and win the day!
160: Ghost of HASTINGS: [To KING RICHARD III]
161: Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake,
162: And in a bloody battle end thy days!
163: Think on Lord Hastings: despair, and die!
164: Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!
165: Arm, fight, and conquer, for fair England's sake!
166: Ghosts
167: of young Princes: [To KING RICHARD III]
168: Dream on thy cousins smother'd in the Tower:
169: Let us be led within thy bosom, Richard,
170: And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!
171: Thy nephews' souls bid thee despair and die!
172: Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace, and wake in joy;
173: Good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy!
174: Live, and beget a happy race of kings!
175: Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.
176: Ghost of LADY ANNE: [To KING RICHARD III]
177: Richard, thy wife, that wretched Anne thy wife,
178: That never slept a quiet hour with thee,
179: Now fills thy sleep with perturbations
180: To-morrow in the battle think on me,
181: And fall thy edgeless sword: despair, and die!
182: Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep
183: Dream of success and happy victory!
184: Thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee.
185: Ghost
186: of BUCKINGHAM: [To KING RICHARD III]
187: The last was I that helped thee to the crown;
188: The last was I that felt thy tyranny:
189: O, in the battle think on Buckingham,
190: And die in terror of thy guiltiness!
191: Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death:
192: Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!
193: I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid:
194: But cheer thy heart, and be thou not dismay'd:
195: God and good angel fight on Richmond's side;
196: And Richard falls in height of all his pride.
197: KING RICHARD III: Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.
198: Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.
199: O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
200: The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
201: Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
202: What do I fear? myself? there's none else by:
203: Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
204: Is there a murderer here? No. Yes, I am:
205: Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why:
206: Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?
207: Alack. I love myself. Wherefore? for any good
208: That I myself have done unto myself?
209: O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
210: For hateful deeds committed by myself!
211: I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.
212: Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.
213: My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
214: And every tongue brings in a several tale,
215: And every tale condemns me for a villain.
216: Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree
217: Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree;
218: All several sins, all used in each degree,
219: Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!
220: I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
221: And if I die, no soul shall pity me:
222: Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself
223: Find in myself no pity to myself?
224: Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
225: Came to my tent; and every one did threat
226: To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.
227: RATCLIFF: My lord!
228: KING RICHARD III: 'Zounds! who is there?
229: RATCLIFF: Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock
230: Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
231: Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour.
232: KING RICHARD III: O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
233: What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?
234: RATCLIFF: No doubt, my lord.
235: KING RICHARD III: O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--
236: RATCLIFF: Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.
237: KING RICHARD III: By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
238: Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
239: Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
240: Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
241: It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;
242: Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
243: To see if any mean to shrink from me.
244: LORDS: Good morrow, Richmond!
245: RICHMOND: Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
246: That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.
247: LORDS: How have you slept, my lord?
248: RICHMOND: The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
249: That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,
250: Have I since your departure had, my lords.
251: Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,
252: Came to my tent, and cried on victory:
253: I promise you, my soul is very jocund
254: In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
255: How far into the morning is it, lords?
256: LORDS: Upon the stroke of four.
257: RICHMOND: Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.
258: More than I have said, loving countrymen,
259: The leisure and enforcement of the time
260: Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,
261: God and our good cause fight upon our side;
262: The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
263: Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
264: Richard except, those whom we fight against
265: Had rather have us win than him they follow:
266: For what is he they follow? truly, gentlemen,
267: A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
268: One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
269: One that made means to come by what he hath,
270: And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;
271: Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil
272: Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
273: One that hath ever been God's enemy:
274: Then, if you fight against God's enemy,
275: God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
276: If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
277: You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
278: If you do fight against your country's foes,
279: Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;
280: If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
281: Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
282: If you do free your children from the sword,
283: Your children's children quit it in your age.
284: Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
285: Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
286: For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
287: Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
288: But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
289: The least of you shall share his part thereof.
290: Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
291: God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!
292: KING RICHARD III: What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?
293: RATCLIFF: That he was never trained up in arms.
294: KING RICHARD III: He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?
295: RATCLIFF: He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'
296: KING RICHARD III: He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
297: Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar.
298: Who saw the sun to-day?
299: RATCLIFF: Not I, my lord.
300: KING RICHARD III: Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
301: He should have braved the east an hour ago
302: A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!
303: RATCLIFF: My lord?
304: KING RICHARD III: The sun will not be seen to-day;
305: The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
306: I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
307: Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
308: More than to Richmond? for the selfsame heaven
309: That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.
310: NORFOLK: Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.
311: KING RICHARD III: Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.
312: Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:
313: I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
314: And thus my battle shall be ordered:
315: My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
316: Consisting equally of horse and foot;
317: Our archers shall be placed in the midst
318: John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
319: Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
320: They thus directed, we will follow
321: In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
322: Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
323: This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?
324: NORFOLK: A good direction, warlike sovereign.
325: This found I on my tent this morning.
326: KING RICHARD III: [Reads]
327: 'Jockey of Norfolk, be not too bold,
328: For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.'
329: A thing devised by the enemy.
330: Go, gentleman, every man unto his charge
331: Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls:
332: Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
333: Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:
334: Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.
335: March on, join bravely, let us to't pell-mell
336: If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.
337: What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?
338: Remember whom you are to cope withal;
339: A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
340: A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,
341: Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth
342: To desperate ventures and assured destruction.
343: You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
344: You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,
345: They would restrain the one, distain the other.
346: And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
347: Long kept in Bretagne at our mother's cost?
348: A milk-sop, one that never in his life
349: Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
350: Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;
351: Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
352: These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
353: Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
354: For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves:
355: If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,
356: And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers
357: Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,
358: And in record, left them the heirs of shame.
359: Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives?
360: Ravish our daughters?
361: Hark! I hear their drum.
362: Fight, gentlemen of England! fight, bold yoemen!
363: Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!
364: Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;
365: Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!
366: What says Lord Stanley? will he bring his power?
367: Messenger: My lord, he doth deny to come.
368: KING RICHARD III: Off with his son George's head!
369: NORFOLK: My lord, the enemy is past the marsh
370: After the battle let George Stanley die.
371: KING RICHARD III: A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:
372: Advance our standards, set upon our foes
373: Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
374: Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
375: Upon them! victory sits on our helms.
ACT 5 SCENE 4

1: CATESBY: Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
2: The king enacts more wonders than a man,
3: Daring an opposite to every danger:
4: His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
5: Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
6: Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
7: KING RICHARD III: A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
8: CATESBY: Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse.
9: KING RICHARD III: Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
10: And I will stand the hazard of the die:
11: I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
12: Five have I slain to-day instead of him.
13: A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
ACT 5 SCENE 5

1: RICHMOND: God and your arms be praised, victorious friends,
2: The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.
3: DERBY: Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.
4: Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
5: From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
6: Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:
7: Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.
8: RICHMOND: Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
9: But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?
10: DERBY: He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
11: Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.
12: RICHMOND: What men of name are slain on either side?
13: DERBY: John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
14: Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
