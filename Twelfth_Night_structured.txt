ACT 1 SCENE 1

1: DUKE ORSINO: If music be the food of love, play on;
2: Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
3: The appetite may sicken, and so die.
4: That strain again! it had a dying fall:
5: O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,
6: That breathes upon a bank of violets,
7: Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:
8: 'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
9: O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,
10: That, notwithstanding thy capacity
11: Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
12: Of what validity and pitch soe'er,
13: But falls into abatement and low price,
14: Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy
15: That it alone is high fantastical.
16: CURIO: Will you go hunt, my lord?
17: DUKE ORSINO: What, Curio?
18: CURIO: The hart.
19: DUKE ORSINO: Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:
20: O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
21: Methought she purged the air of pestilence!
22: That instant was I turn'd into a hart;
23: And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
24: E'er since pursue me.
25: How now! what news from her?
26: VALENTINE: So please my lord, I might not be admitted;
27: But from her handmaid do return this answer:
28: The element itself, till seven years' heat,
29: Shall not behold her face at ample view;
30: But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk
31: And water once a day her chamber round
32: With eye-offending brine: all this to season
33: A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
34: And lasting in her sad remembrance.
35: DUKE ORSINO: O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
36: To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
37: How will she love, when the rich golden shaft
38: Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
39: That live in her; when liver, brain and heart,
40: These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd
41: Her sweet perfections with one self king!
42: Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:
43: Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.
ACT 1 SCENE 2

1: VIOLA: What country, friends, is this?
2: Captain: This is Illyria, lady.
3: VIOLA: And what should I do in Illyria?
4: My brother he is in Elysium.
5: Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?
6: Captain: It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
7: VIOLA: O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
8: Captain: True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
9: Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
10: When you and those poor number saved with you
11: Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
12: Most provident in peril, bind himself,
13: Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,
14: To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;
15: Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
16: I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
17: So long as I could see.
18: VIOLA: For saying so, there's gold:
19: Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
20: Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
21: The like of him. Know'st thou this country?
22: Captain: Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
23: Not three hours' travel from this very place.
24: VIOLA: Who governs here?
25: Captain: A noble duke, in nature as in name.
26: VIOLA: What is the name?
27: Captain: Orsino.
28: VIOLA: Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
29: He was a bachelor then.
30: Captain: And so is now, or was so very late;
31: For but a month ago I went from hence,
32: And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,
33: What great ones do the less will prattle of,--
34: That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
35: VIOLA: What's she?
36: Captain: A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
37: That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
38: In the protection of his son, her brother,
39: Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,
40: They say, she hath abjured the company
41: And sight of men.
42: VIOLA: O that I served that lady
43: And might not be delivered to the world,
44: Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,
45: What my estate is!
46: Captain: That were hard to compass;
47: Because she will admit no kind of suit,
48: No, not the duke's.
49: VIOLA: There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;
50: And though that nature with a beauteous wall
51: Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
52: I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
53: With this thy fair and outward character.
54: I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
55: Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
56: For such disguise as haply shall become
57: The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
58: Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:
59: It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
60: And speak to him in many sorts of music
61: That will allow me very worth his service.
62: What else may hap to time I will commit;
63: Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
64: Captain: Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:
65: When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
66: VIOLA: I thank thee: lead me on.
ACT 1 SCENE 3

1: SIR TOBY BELCH: What a plague means my niece, to take the death of
2: her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.
3: MARIA: By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o'
4: nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great
5: exceptions to your ill hours.
6: SIR TOBY BELCH: Why, let her except, before excepted.
7: MARIA: Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest
8: limits of order.
9: SIR TOBY BELCH: Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am:
10: these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so be
11: these boots too: an they be not, let them hang
12: themselves in their own straps.
13: MARIA: That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard
14: my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish
15: knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.
16: SIR TOBY BELCH: Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
17: MARIA: Ay, he.
18: SIR TOBY BELCH: He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.
19: MARIA: What's that to the purpose?
20: SIR TOBY BELCH: Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.
21: MARIA: Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats:
22: he's a very fool and a prodigal.
23: SIR TOBY BELCH: Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the
24: viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages
25: word for word without book, and hath all the good
26: gifts of nature.
27: MARIA: He hath indeed, almost natural: for besides that
28: he's a fool, he's a great quarreller: and but that
29: he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he
30: hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent
31: he would quickly have the gift of a grave.
32: SIR TOBY BELCH: By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors
33: that say so of him. Who are they?
34: MARIA: They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.
35: SIR TOBY BELCH: With drinking healths to my niece: I'll drink to
36: her as long as there is a passage in my throat and
37: drink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrill
38: that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn
39: o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!
40: Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.
41: SIR ANDREW: Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!
42: SIR TOBY BELCH: Sweet Sir Andrew!
43: SIR ANDREW: Bless you, fair shrew.
44: MARIA: And you too, sir.
45: SIR TOBY BELCH: Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.
46: SIR ANDREW: What's that?
47: SIR TOBY BELCH: My niece's chambermaid.
48: SIR ANDREW: Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
49: MARIA: My name is Mary, sir.
50: SIR ANDREW: Good Mistress Mary Accost,--
51: SIR TOBY BELCH: You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, board
52: her, woo her, assail her.
53: SIR ANDREW: By my troth, I would not undertake her in this
54: company. Is that the meaning of 'accost'?
55: MARIA: Fare you well, gentlemen.
56: SIR TOBY BELCH: An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst
57: never draw sword again.
58: SIR ANDREW: An you part so, mistress, I would I might never
59: draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have
60: fools in hand?
61: MARIA: Sir, I have not you by the hand.
62: SIR ANDREW: Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.
63: MARIA: Now, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you, bring
64: your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.
65: SIR ANDREW: Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?
66: MARIA: It's dry, sir.
67: SIR ANDREW: Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can
68: keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?
69: MARIA: A dry jest, sir.
70: SIR ANDREW: Are you full of them?
71: MARIA: Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends: marry,
72: now I let go your hand, I am barren.
73: SIR TOBY BELCH: O knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I
74: see thee so put down?
75: SIR ANDREW: Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary
76: put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit
77: than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a
78: great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.
79: SIR TOBY BELCH: No question.
80: SIR ANDREW: An I thought that, I'ld forswear it. I'll ride home
81: to-morrow, Sir Toby.
82: SIR TOBY BELCH: Pourquoi, my dear knight?
83: SIR ANDREW: What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had
84: bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in
85: fencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I but
86: followed the arts!
87: SIR TOBY BELCH: Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
88: SIR ANDREW: Why, would that have mended my hair?
89: SIR TOBY BELCH: Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
90: SIR ANDREW: But it becomes me well enough, does't not?
91: SIR TOBY BELCH: Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I
92: hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs
93: and spin it off.
94: SIR ANDREW: Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece
95: will not be seen; or if she be, it's four to one
96: she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.
97: SIR TOBY BELCH: She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
98: her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I
99: have heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't,
100: man.
101: SIR ANDREW: I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the
102: strangest mind i' the world; I delight in masques
103: and revels sometimes altogether.
104: SIR TOBY BELCH: Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?
105: SIR ANDREW: As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the
106: degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare
107: with an old man.
108: SIR TOBY BELCH: What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
109: SIR ANDREW: Faith, I can cut a caper.
110: SIR TOBY BELCH: And I can cut the mutton to't.
111: SIR ANDREW: And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong
112: as any man in Illyria.
113: SIR TOBY BELCH: Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have
114: these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to
115: take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost
116: thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in
117: a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not
118: so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What
119: dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?
120: I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy
121: leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.
122: SIR ANDREW: Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a
123: flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?
124: SIR TOBY BELCH: What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?
125: SIR ANDREW: Taurus! That's sides and heart.
126: SIR TOBY BELCH: No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the
127: caper; ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!
ACT 1 SCENE 4

1: VALENTINE: If the duke continue these favours towards you,
2: Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath
3: known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.
4: VIOLA: You either fear his humour or my negligence, that
5: you call in question the continuance of his love:
6: is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?
7: VALENTINE: No, believe me.
8: VIOLA: I thank you. Here comes the count.
9: DUKE ORSINO: Who saw Cesario, ho?
10: VIOLA: On your attendance, my lord; here.
11: DUKE ORSINO: Stand you a while aloof, Cesario,
12: Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd
13: To thee the book even of my secret soul:
14: Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;
15: Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
16: And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow
17: Till thou have audience.
18: VIOLA: Sure, my noble lord,
19: If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
20: As it is spoke, she never will admit me.
21: DUKE ORSINO: Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
22: Rather than make unprofited return.
23: VIOLA: Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
24: DUKE ORSINO: O, then unfold the passion of my love,
25: Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:
26: It shall become thee well to act my woes;
27: She will attend it better in thy youth
28: Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.
29: VIOLA: I think not so, my lord.
30: DUKE ORSINO: Dear lad, believe it;
31: For they shall yet belie thy happy years,
32: That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
33: Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe
34: Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,
35: And all is semblative a woman's part.
36: I know thy constellation is right apt
37: For this affair. Some four or five attend him;
38: All, if you will; for I myself am best
39: When least in company. Prosper well in this,
40: And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
41: To call his fortunes thine.
42: VIOLA: I'll do my best
43: To woo your lady:
44: yet, a barful strife!
45: Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.
ACT 1 SCENE 5

1: MARIA: Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will
2: not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in
3: way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.
4: Clown: Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this
5: world needs to fear no colours.
6: MARIA: Make that good.
7: Clown: He shall see none to fear.
8: MARIA: A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that
9: saying was born, of 'I fear no colours.'
10: Clown: Where, good Mistress Mary?
11: MARIA: In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.
12: Clown: Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those
13: that are fools, let them use their talents.
14: MARIA: Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or,
15: to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?
16: Clown: Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and,
17: for turning away, let summer bear it out.
18: MARIA: You are resolute, then?
19: Clown: Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.
20: MARIA: That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both
21: break, your gaskins fall.
22: Clown: Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way; if
23: Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a
24: piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.
25: MARIA: Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my
26: lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.
27: Clown: Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling!
28: Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft
29: prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, may
30: pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?
31: 'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'
32: God bless thee, lady!
33: OLIVIA: Take the fool away.
34: Clown: Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.
35: OLIVIA: Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you:
36: besides, you grow dishonest.
37: Clown: Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel
38: will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is
39: the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend
40: himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if
41: he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing
42: that's mended is but patched: virtue that
43: transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that
44: amends is but patched with virtue. If that this
45: simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,
46: what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but
47: calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take
48: away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.
49: OLIVIA: Sir, I bade them take away you.
50: Clown: Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non
51: facit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear not
52: motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to
53: prove you a fool.
54: OLIVIA: Can you do it?
55: Clown: Dexterously, good madonna.
56: OLIVIA: Make your proof.
57: Clown: I must catechise you for it, madonna: good my mouse
58: of virtue, answer me.
59: OLIVIA: Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.
60: Clown: Good madonna, why mournest thou?
61: OLIVIA: Good fool, for my brother's death.
62: Clown: I think his soul is in hell, madonna.
63: OLIVIA: I know his soul is in heaven, fool.
64: Clown: The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's
65: soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.
66: OLIVIA: What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?
67: MALVOLIO: Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him:
68: infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the
69: better fool.
70: Clown: God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the
71: better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be
72: sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his
73: word for two pence that you are no fool.
74: OLIVIA: How say you to that, Malvolio?
75: MALVOLIO: I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a
76: barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day
77: with an ordinary fool that has no more brain
78: than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard
79: already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to
80: him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,
81: that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better
82: than the fools' zanies.
83: OLIVIA: Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste
84: with a distempered appetite. To be generous,
85: guiltless and of free disposition, is to take those
86: things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets:
87: there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do
88: nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet
89: man, though he do nothing but reprove.
90: Clown: Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou
91: speakest well of fools!
92: MARIA: Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much
93: desires to speak with you.
94: OLIVIA: From the Count Orsino, is it?
95: MARIA: I know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.
96: OLIVIA: Who of my people hold him in delay?
97: MARIA: Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.
98: OLIVIA: Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but
99: madman: fie on him!
100: Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, I
101: am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.
102: Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and
103: people dislike it.
104: Clown: Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest
105: son should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram with
106: brains! for,--here he comes,--one of thy kin has a
107: most weak pia mater.
108: OLIVIA: By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?
109: SIR TOBY BELCH: A gentleman.
110: OLIVIA: A gentleman! what gentleman?
111: SIR TOBY BELCH: 'Tis a gentle man here--a plague o' these
112: pickle-herring! How now, sot!
113: Clown: Good Sir Toby!
114: OLIVIA: Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?
115: SIR TOBY BELCH: Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.
116: OLIVIA: Ay, marry, what is he?
117: SIR TOBY BELCH: Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not: give
118: me faith, say I. Well, it's all one.
119: OLIVIA: What's a drunken man like, fool?
120: Clown: Like a drowned man, a fool and a mad man: one
121: draught above heat makes him a fool; the second mads
122: him; and a third drowns him.
123: OLIVIA: Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my
124: coz; for he's in the third degree of drink, he's
125: drowned: go, look after him.
126: Clown: He is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look
127: to the madman.
128: MALVOLIO: Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with
129: you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to
130: understand so much, and therefore comes to speak
131: with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to
132: have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore
133: comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,
134: lady? he's fortified against any denial.
135: OLIVIA: Tell him he shall not speak with me.
136: MALVOLIO: Has been told so; and he says, he'll stand at your
137: door like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter to
138: a bench, but he'll speak with you.
139: OLIVIA: What kind o' man is he?
140: MALVOLIO: Why, of mankind.
141: OLIVIA: What manner of man?
142: MALVOLIO: Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.
143: OLIVIA: Of what personage and years is he?
144: MALVOLIO: Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for
145: a boy; as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or a
146: cooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him
147: in standing water, between boy and man. He is very
148: well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; one
149: would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.
150: OLIVIA: Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.
151: MALVOLIO: Gentlewoman, my lady calls.
152: OLIVIA: Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face.
153: We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.
154: VIOLA: The honourable lady of the house, which is she?
155: OLIVIA: Speak to me; I shall answer for her.
156: Your will?
157: VIOLA: Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,--I
158: pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,
159: for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away
160: my speech, for besides that it is excellently well
161: penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good
162: beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very
163: comptible, even to the least sinister usage.
164: OLIVIA: Whence came you, sir?
165: VIOLA: I can say little more than I have studied, and that
166: question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me
167: modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,
168: that I may proceed in my speech.
169: OLIVIA: Are you a comedian?
170: VIOLA: No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs
171: of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you
172: the lady of the house?
173: OLIVIA: If I do not usurp myself, I am.
174: VIOLA: Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp
175: yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours
176: to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will
177: on with my speech in your praise, and then show you
178: the heart of my message.
179: OLIVIA: Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.
180: VIOLA: Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.
181: OLIVIA: It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,
182: keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,
183: and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you
184: than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if
185: you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time of
186: moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.
187: MARIA: Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.
188: VIOLA: No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little
189: longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet
190: lady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.
191: OLIVIA: Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when
192: the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.
193: VIOLA: It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of
194: war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my
195: hand; my words are as fun of peace as matter.
196: OLIVIA: Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?
197: VIOLA: The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
198: learned from my entertainment. What I am, and what I
199: would, are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears,
200: divinity, to any other's, profanation.
201: OLIVIA: Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.
202: Now, sir, what is your text?
203: VIOLA: Most sweet lady,--
204: OLIVIA: A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.
205: Where lies your text?
206: VIOLA: In Orsino's bosom.
207: OLIVIA: In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?
208: VIOLA: To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.
209: OLIVIA: O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?
210: VIOLA: Good madam, let me see your face.
211: OLIVIA: Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate
212: with my face? You are now out of your text: but
213: we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.
214: Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't
215: not well done?
216: VIOLA: Excellently done, if God did all.
217: OLIVIA: 'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.
218: VIOLA: 'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
219: Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:
220: Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,
221: If you will lead these graces to the grave
222: And leave the world no copy.
223: OLIVIA: O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give
224: out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be
225: inventoried, and every particle and utensil
226: labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,
227: indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to
228: them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were
229: you sent hither to praise me?
230: VIOLA: I see you what you are, you are too proud;
231: But, if you were the devil, you are fair.
232: My lord and master loves you: O, such love
233: Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd
234: The nonpareil of beauty!
235: OLIVIA: How does he love me?
236: VIOLA: With adorations, fertile tears,
237: With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
238: OLIVIA: Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:
239: Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
240: Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
241: In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;
242: And in dimension and the shape of nature
243: A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;
244: He might have took his answer long ago.
245: VIOLA: If I did love you in my master's flame,
246: With such a suffering, such a deadly life,
247: In your denial I would find no sense;
248: I would not understand it.
249: OLIVIA: Why, what would you?
250: VIOLA: Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
251: And call upon my soul within the house;
252: Write loyal cantons of contemned love
253: And sing them loud even in the dead of night;
254: Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
255: And make the babbling gossip of the air
256: Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest
257: Between the elements of air and earth,
258: But you should pity me!
259: OLIVIA: You might do much.
260: What is your parentage?
261: VIOLA: Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
262: I am a gentleman.
263: OLIVIA: Get you to your lord;
264: I cannot love him: let him send no more;
265: Unless, perchance, you come to me again,
266: To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:
267: I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.
268: VIOLA: I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:
269: My master, not myself, lacks recompense.
270: Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;
271: And let your fervor, like my master's, be
272: Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.
273: OLIVIA: 'What is your parentage?'
274: 'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
275: I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art;
276: Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions and spirit,
277: Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:
278: soft, soft!
279: Unless the master were the man. How now!
280: Even so quickly may one catch the plague?
281: Methinks I feel this youth's perfections
282: With an invisible and subtle stealth
283: To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.
284: What ho, Malvolio!
285: MALVOLIO: Here, madam, at your service.
286: OLIVIA: Run after that same peevish messenger,
287: The county's man: he left this ring behind him,
288: Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.
289: Desire him not to flatter with his lord,
290: Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him:
291: If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,
292: I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee, Malvolio.
293: MALVOLIO: Madam, I will.
ACT 2 SCENE 1

1: ANTONIO: Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?
2: SEBASTIAN: By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over
3: me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps
4: distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your
5: leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad
6: recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.
7: ANTONIO: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.
8: No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere
9: extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a
10: touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me
11: what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges
12: me in manners the rather to express myself. You
13: must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,
14: which I called Roderigo. My father was that
15: Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard
16: of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both
17: born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,
18: would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;
19: for some hour before you took me from the breach of
20: the sea was my sister drowned.
21: ANTONIO: Alas the day!
22: SEBASTIAN: A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled
23: me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,
24: though I could not with such estimable wonder
25: overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly
26: publish her; she bore a mind that envy could not but
27: call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt
28: water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.
29: ANTONIO: Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.
30: SEBASTIAN: O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.
31: ANTONIO: If you will not murder me for my love, let me be
32: your servant.
33: SEBASTIAN: If you will not undo what you have done, that is,
34: kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.
35: Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,
36: and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that
37: upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
38: tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.
39: ANTONIO: The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
40: I have many enemies in Orsino's court,
41: Else would I very shortly see thee there.
42: But, come what may, I do adore thee so,
43: That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.
ACT 2 SCENE 2

1: MALVOLIO: Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?
2: VIOLA: Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since
3: arrived but hither.
4: MALVOLIO: She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have
5: saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.
6: She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord
7: into a desperate assurance she will none of him:
8: and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to
9: come again in his affairs, unless it be to report
10: your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.
11: VIOLA: She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.
12: MALVOLIO: Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her
13: will is, it should be so returned: if it be worth
14: stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, be
15: it his that finds it.
16: VIOLA: I left no ring with her: what means this lady?
17: Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!
18: She made good view of me; indeed, so much,
19: That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,
20: For she did speak in starts distractedly.
21: She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion
22: Invites me in this churlish messenger.
23: None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.
24: I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,
25: Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
26: Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,
27: Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
28: How easy is it for the proper-false
29: In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!
30: Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!
31: For such as we are made of, such we be.
32: How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;
33: And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;
34: And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.
35: What will become of this? As I am man,
36: My state is desperate for my master's love;
37: As I am woman,--now alas the day!--
38: What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!
39: O time! thou must untangle this, not I;
40: It is too hard a knot for me to untie!
ACT 2 SCENE 3

1: SIR TOBY BELCH: Approach, Sir Andrew: not to be abed after
2: midnight is to be up betimes; and 'diluculo
3: surgere,' thou know'st,--
4: SIR ANDREW: Nay, my troth, I know not: but I know, to be up
5: late is to be up late.
6: SIR TOBY BELCH: A false conclusion: I hate it as an unfilled can.
7: To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is
8: early: so that to go to bed after midnight is to go
9: to bed betimes. Does not our life consist of the
10: four elements?
11: SIR ANDREW: Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists
12: of eating and drinking.
13: SIR TOBY BELCH: Thou'rt a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.
14: Marian, I say! a stoup of wine!
15: SIR ANDREW: Here comes the fool, i' faith.
16: Clown: How now, my hearts! did you never see the picture
17: of 'we three'?
18: SIR TOBY BELCH: Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.
19: SIR ANDREW: By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I
20: had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,
21: and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In
22: sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last
23: night, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of the
24: Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus: 'twas
25: very good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy
26: leman: hadst it?
27: Clown: I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's nose
28: is no whipstock: my lady has a white hand, and the
29: Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.
30: SIR ANDREW: Excellent! why, this is the best fooling, when all
31: is done. Now, a song.
32: SIR TOBY BELCH: Come on; there is sixpence for you: let's have a song.
33: SIR ANDREW: There's a testril of me too: if one knight give a--
34: Clown: Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?
35: SIR TOBY BELCH: A love-song, a love-song.
36: SIR ANDREW: Ay, ay: I care not for good life.
37: Clown: [Sings]
38: O mistress mine, where are you roaming?
39: O, stay and hear; your true love's coming,
40: That can sing both high and low:
41: Trip no further, pretty sweeting;
42: Journeys end in lovers meeting,
43: Every wise man's son doth know.
44: SIR ANDREW: Excellent good, i' faith.
45: SIR TOBY BELCH: Good, good.
46: Clown: [Sings]
47: What is love? 'tis not hereafter;
48: Present mirth hath present laughter;
49: What's to come is still unsure:
50: In delay there lies no plenty;
51: Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,
52: Youth's a stuff will not endure.
53: SIR ANDREW: A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.
54: SIR TOBY BELCH: A contagious breath.
55: SIR ANDREW: Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.
56: SIR TOBY BELCH: To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.
57: But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? shall we
58: rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three
59: souls out of one weaver? shall we do that?
60: SIR ANDREW: An you love me, let's do't: I am dog at a catch.
61: Clown: By'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.
62: SIR ANDREW: Most certain. Let our catch be, 'Thou knave.'
63: Clown: 'Hold thy peace, thou knave,' knight? I shall be
64: constrained in't to call thee knave, knight.
65: SIR ANDREW: 'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to
66: call me knave. Begin, fool: it begins 'Hold thy peace.'
67: Clown: I shall never begin if I hold my peace.
68: SIR ANDREW: Good, i' faith. Come, begin.
69: MARIA: What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady
70: have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him
71: turn you out of doors, never trust me.
72: SIR TOBY BELCH: My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's
73: a Peg-a-Ramsey, and 'Three merry men be we.' Am not
74: I consanguineous? am I not of her blood?
75: Tillyvally. Lady!
76: 'There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady!'
77: Clown: Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.
78: SIR ANDREW: Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do
79: I too: he does it with a better grace, but I do it
80: more natural.
81: SIR TOBY BELCH: [Sings] 'O, the twelfth day of December,'--
82: MARIA: For the love o' God, peace!
83: MALVOLIO: My masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have ye
84: no wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like
85: tinkers at this time of night? Do ye make an
86: alehouse of my lady's house, that ye squeak out your
87: coziers' catches without any mitigation or remorse
88: of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor
89: time in you?
90: SIR TOBY BELCH: We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!
91: MALVOLIO: Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me
92: tell you, that, though she harbours you as her
93: kinsman, she's nothing allied to your disorders. If
94: you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors, you
95: are welcome to the house; if not, an it would please
96: you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid
97: you farewell.
98: SIR TOBY BELCH: 'Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.'
99: MARIA: Nay, good Sir Toby.
100: Clown: 'His eyes do show his days are almost done.'
101: MALVOLIO: Is't even so?
102: SIR TOBY BELCH: 'But I will never die.'
103: Clown: Sir Toby, there you lie.
104: MALVOLIO: This is much credit to you.
105: SIR TOBY BELCH: 'Shall I bid him go?'
106: Clown: 'What an if you do?'
107: SIR TOBY BELCH: 'Shall I bid him go, and spare not?'
108: Clown: 'O no, no, no, no, you dare not.'
109: SIR TOBY BELCH: Out o' tune, sir: ye lie. Art any more than a
110: steward? Dost thou think, because thou art
111: virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?
112: Clown: Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the
113: mouth too.
114: SIR TOBY BELCH: Thou'rt i' the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with
115: crumbs. A stoup of wine, Maria!
116: MALVOLIO: Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favour at any
117: thing more than contempt, you would not give means
118: for this uncivil rule: she shall know of it, by this hand.
119: MARIA: Go shake your ears.
120: SIR ANDREW: 'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's
121: a-hungry, to challenge him the field, and then to
122: break promise with him and make a fool of him.
123: SIR TOBY BELCH: Do't, knight: I'll write thee a challenge: or I'll
124: deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.
125: MARIA: Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight: since the
126: youth of the count's was today with thy lady, she is
127: much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me
128: alone with him: if I do not gull him into a
129: nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not
130: think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed:
131: I know I can do it.
132: SIR TOBY BELCH: Possess us, possess us; tell us something of him.
133: MARIA: Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.
134: SIR ANDREW: O, if I thought that I'ld beat him like a dog!
135: SIR TOBY BELCH: What, for being a puritan? thy exquisite reason,
136: dear knight?
137: SIR ANDREW: I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason
138: good enough.
139: MARIA: The devil a puritan that he is, or any thing
140: constantly, but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass,
141: that cons state without book and utters it by great
142: swarths: the best persuaded of himself, so
143: crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is
144: his grounds of faith that all that look on him love
145: him; and on that vice in him will my revenge find
146: notable cause to work.
147: SIR TOBY BELCH: What wilt thou do?
148: MARIA: I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of
149: love; wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape
150: of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure
151: of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find
152: himself most feelingly personated. I can write very
153: like my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter we
154: can hardly make distinction of our hands.
155: SIR TOBY BELCH: Excellent! I smell a device.
156: SIR ANDREW: I have't in my nose too.
157: SIR TOBY BELCH: He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop,
158: that they come from my niece, and that she's in
159: love with him.
160: MARIA: My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.
161: SIR ANDREW: And your horse now would make him an ass.
162: MARIA: Ass, I doubt not.
163: SIR ANDREW: O, 'twill be admirable!
164: MARIA: Sport royal, I warrant you: I know my physic will
165: work with him. I will plant you two, and let the
166: fool make a third, where he shall find the letter:
167: observe his construction of it. For this night, to
168: bed, and dream on the event. Farewell.
169: SIR TOBY BELCH: Good night, Penthesilea.
170: SIR ANDREW: Before me, she's a good wench.
171: SIR TOBY BELCH: She's a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me:
172: what o' that?
173: SIR ANDREW: I was adored once too.
174: SIR TOBY BELCH: Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for
175: more money.
176: SIR ANDREW: If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.
177: SIR TOBY BELCH: Send for money, knight: if thou hast her not i'
178: the end, call me cut.
179: SIR ANDREW: If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.
180: SIR TOBY BELCH: Come, come, I'll go burn some sack; 'tis too late
181: to go to bed now: come, knight; come, knight.
ACT 2 SCENE 4

1: DUKE ORSINO: Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.
2: Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,
3: That old and antique song we heard last night:
4: Methought it did relieve my passion much,
5: More than light airs and recollected terms
6: Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:
7: Come, but one verse.
8: CURIO: He is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it.
9: DUKE ORSINO: Who was it?
10: CURIO: Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the lady
11: Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house.
12: DUKE ORSINO: Seek him out, and play the tune the while.
13: Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,
14: In the sweet pangs of it remember me;
15: For such as I am all true lovers are,
16: Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,
17: Save in the constant image of the creature
18: That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?
19: VIOLA: It gives a very echo to the seat
20: Where Love is throned.
21: DUKE ORSINO: Thou dost speak masterly:
22: My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye
23: Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:
24: Hath it not, boy?
25: VIOLA: A little, by your favour.
26: DUKE ORSINO: What kind of woman is't?
27: VIOLA: Of your complexion.
28: DUKE ORSINO: She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?
29: VIOLA: About your years, my lord.
30: DUKE ORSINO: Too old by heaven: let still the woman take
31: An elder than herself: so wears she to him,
32: So sways she level in her husband's heart:
33: For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,
34: Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
35: More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,
36: Than women's are.
37: VIOLA: I think it well, my lord.
38: DUKE ORSINO: Then let thy love be younger than thyself,
39: Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;
40: For women are as roses, whose fair flower
41: Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour.
42: VIOLA: And so they are: alas, that they are so;
43: To die, even when they to perfection grow!
44: DUKE ORSINO: O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.
45: Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;
46: The spinsters and the knitters in the sun
47: And the free maids that weave their thread with bones
48: Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,
49: And dallies with the innocence of love,
50: Like the old age.
51: Clown: Are you ready, sir?
52: DUKE ORSINO: Ay; prithee, sing.
53: SONG.
54: Clown: Come away, come away, death,
55: And in sad cypress let me be laid;
56: Fly away, fly away breath;
57: I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
58: My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
59: O, prepare it!
60: My part of death, no one so true
61: Did share it.
62: Not a flower, not a flower sweet
63: On my black coffin let there be strown;
64: Not a friend, not a friend greet
65: My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:
66: A thousand thousand sighs to save,
67: Lay me, O, where
68: Sad true lover never find my grave,
69: To weep there!
70: DUKE ORSINO: There's for thy pains.
71: Clown: No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.
72: DUKE ORSINO: I'll pay thy pleasure then.
73: Clown: Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.
74: DUKE ORSINO: Give me now leave to leave thee.
75: Clown: Now, the melancholy god protect thee; and the
76: tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for
77: thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such
78: constancy put to sea, that their business might be
79: every thing and their intent every where; for that's
80: it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.
81: DUKE ORSINO: Let all the rest give place.
82: Once more, Cesario,
83: Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:
84: Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,
85: Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
86: The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,
87: Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;
88: But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems
89: That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
90: VIOLA: But if she cannot love you, sir?
91: DUKE ORSINO: I cannot be so answer'd.
92: VIOLA: Sooth, but you must.
93: Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,
94: Hath for your love a great a pang of heart
95: As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;
96: You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?
97: DUKE ORSINO: There is no woman's sides
98: Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
99: As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart
100: So big, to hold so much; they lack retention
101: Alas, their love may be call'd appetite,
102: No motion of the liver, but the palate,
103: That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;
104: But mine is all as hungry as the sea,
105: And can digest as much: make no compare
106: Between that love a woman can bear me
107: And that I owe Olivia.
108: VIOLA: Ay, but I know--
109: DUKE ORSINO: What dost thou know?
110: VIOLA: Too well what love women to men may owe:
111: In faith, they are as true of heart as we.
112: My father had a daughter loved a man,
113: As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,
114: I should your lordship.
115: DUKE ORSINO: And what's her history?
116: VIOLA: A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
117: But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,
118: Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,
119: And with a green and yellow melancholy
120: She sat like patience on a monument,
121: Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
122: We men may say more, swear more: but indeed
123: Our shows are more than will; for still we prove
124: Much in our vows, but little in our love.
125: DUKE ORSINO: But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
126: VIOLA: I am all the daughters of my father's house,
127: And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.
128: Sir, shall I to this lady?
129: DUKE ORSINO: Ay, that's the theme.
130: To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,
131: My love can give no place, bide no denay.
ACT 2 SCENE 5

1: SIR TOBY BELCH: Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.
2: FABIAN: Nay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport,
3: let me be boiled to death with melancholy.
4: SIR TOBY BELCH: Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly
5: rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?
6: FABIAN: I would exult, man: you know, he brought me out o'
7: favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here.
8: SIR TOBY BELCH: To anger him we'll have the bear again; and we will
9: fool him black and blue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?
10: SIR ANDREW: An we do not, it is pity of our lives.
11: SIR TOBY BELCH: Here comes the little villain.
12: How now, my metal of India!
13: MARIA: Get ye all three into the box-tree: Malvolio's
14: coming down this walk: he has been yonder i' the
15: sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half
16: hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for I
17: know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of
18: him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there,
19: for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.
20: MALVOLIO: 'Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once told
21: me she did affect me: and I have heard herself come
22: thus near, that, should she fancy, it should be one
23: of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more
24: exalted respect than any one else that follows her.
25: What should I think on't?
26: SIR TOBY BELCH: Here's an overweening rogue!
27: FABIAN: O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock
28: of him: how he jets under his advanced plumes!
29: SIR ANDREW: 'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!
30: SIR TOBY BELCH: Peace, I say.
31: MALVOLIO: To be Count Malvolio!
32: SIR TOBY BELCH: Ah, rogue!
33: SIR ANDREW: Pistol him, pistol him.
34: SIR TOBY BELCH: Peace, peace!
35: MALVOLIO: There is example for't; the lady of the Strachy
36: married the yeoman of the wardrobe.
37: SIR ANDREW: Fie on him, Jezebel!
38: FABIAN: O, peace! now he's deeply in: look how
39: imagination blows him.
40: MALVOLIO: Having been three months married to her, sitting in
41: my state,--
42: SIR TOBY BELCH: O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!
43: MALVOLIO: Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet
44: gown; having come from a day-bed, where I have left
45: Olivia sleeping,--
46: SIR TOBY BELCH: Fire and brimstone!
47: FABIAN: O, peace, peace!
48: MALVOLIO: And then to have the humour of state; and after a
49: demure travel of regard, telling them I know my
50: place as I would they should do theirs, to for my
51: kinsman Toby,--
52: SIR TOBY BELCH: Bolts and shackles!
53: FABIAN: O peace, peace, peace! now, now.
54: MALVOLIO: Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make
55: out for him: I frown the while; and perchance wind
56: up watch, or play with my--some rich jewel. Toby
57: approaches; courtesies there to me,--
58: SIR TOBY BELCH: Shall this fellow live?
59: FABIAN: Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.
60: MALVOLIO: I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar
61: smile with an austere regard of control,--
62: SIR TOBY BELCH: And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?
63: MALVOLIO: Saying, 'Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on
64: your niece give me this prerogative of speech,'--
65: SIR TOBY BELCH: What, what?
66: MALVOLIO: 'You must amend your drunkenness.'
67: SIR TOBY BELCH: Out, scab!
68: FABIAN: Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.
69: MALVOLIO: 'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with
70: a foolish knight,'--
71: SIR ANDREW: That's me, I warrant you.
72: MALVOLIO: 'One Sir Andrew,'--
73: SIR ANDREW: I knew 'twas I; for many do call me fool.
74: MALVOLIO: What employment have we here?
75: FABIAN: Now is the woodcock near the gin.
76: SIR TOBY BELCH: O, peace! and the spirit of humour intimate reading
77: aloud to him!
78: MALVOLIO: By my life, this is my lady's hand these be her
79: very C's, her U's and her T's and thus makes she her
80: great P's. It is, in contempt of question, her hand.
81: SIR ANDREW: Her C's, her U's and her T's: why that?
82: MALVOLIO: [Reads] 'To the unknown beloved, this, and my good
83: wishes:'--her very phrases! By your leave, wax.
84: Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with which she
85: uses to seal: 'tis my lady. To whom should this be?
86: FABIAN: This wins him, liver and all.
87: MALVOLIO: [Reads]
88: Jove knows I love: But who?
89: Lips, do not move;
90: No man must know.
91: 'No man must know.' What follows? the numbers
92: altered! 'No man must know:' if this should be
93: thee, Malvolio?
94: SIR TOBY BELCH: Marry, hang thee, brock!
95: MALVOLIO: [Reads]
96: I may command where I adore;
97: But silence, like a Lucrece knife,
98: With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:
99: M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.
100: FABIAN: A fustian riddle!
101: SIR TOBY BELCH: Excellent wench, say I.
102: MALVOLIO: 'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.' Nay, but first, let
103: me see, let me see, let me see.
104: FABIAN: What dish o' poison has she dressed him!
105: SIR TOBY BELCH: And with what wing the staniel cheques at it!
106: MALVOLIO: 'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command
107: me: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this is
108: evident to any formal capacity; there is no
109: obstruction in this: and the end,--what should
110: that alphabetical position portend? If I could make
111: that resemble something in me,--Softly! M, O, A,
112: I,--
113: SIR TOBY BELCH: O, ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent.
114: FABIAN: Sowter will cry upon't for all this, though it be as
115: rank as a fox.
116: MALVOLIO: M,--Malvolio; M,--why, that begins my name.
117: FABIAN: Did not I say he would work it out? the cur is
118: excellent at faults.
119: MALVOLIO: M,--but then there is no consonancy in the sequel;
120: that suffers under probation A should follow but O does.
121: FABIAN: And O shall end, I hope.
122: SIR TOBY BELCH: Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry O!
123: MALVOLIO: And then I comes behind.
124: FABIAN: Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might see
125: more detraction at your heels than fortunes before
126: you.
127: MALVOLIO: M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former: and
128: yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for
129: every one of these letters are in my name. Soft!
130: here follows prose.
131: 'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I
132: am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some
133: are born great, some achieve greatness, and some
134: have greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open
135: their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;
136: and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,
137: cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be
138: opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let
139: thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into
140: the trick of singularity: she thus advises thee
141: that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy
142: yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever
143: cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art
144: made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see
145: thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and
146: not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.
147: She that would alter services with thee,
148: THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'
149: Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is
150: open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,
151: I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross
152: acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.
153: I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade
154: me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady
155: loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of
156: late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;
157: and in this she manifests herself to my love, and
158: with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
159: of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will
160: be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and
161: cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting
162: on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a
163: postscript.
164: 'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou
165: entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling;
166: thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my
167: presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.'
168: Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will do
169: everything that thou wilt have me.
170: FABIAN: I will not give my part of this sport for a pension
171: of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.
172: SIR TOBY BELCH: I could marry this wench for this device.
173: SIR ANDREW: So could I too.
174: SIR TOBY BELCH: And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.
175: SIR ANDREW: Nor I neither.
176: FABIAN: Here comes my noble gull-catcher.
177: SIR TOBY BELCH: Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?
178: SIR ANDREW: Or o' mine either?
179: SIR TOBY BELCH: Shall I play my freedom at traytrip, and become thy
180: bond-slave?
181: SIR ANDREW: I' faith, or I either?
182: SIR TOBY BELCH: Why, thou hast put him in such a dream, that when
183: the image of it leaves him he must run mad.
184: MARIA: Nay, but say true; does it work upon him?
185: SIR TOBY BELCH: Like aqua-vitae with a midwife.
186: MARIA: If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark
187: his first approach before my lady: he will come to
188: her in yellow stockings, and 'tis a colour she
189: abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests;
190: and he will smile upon her, which will now be so
191: unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a
192: melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him
193: into a notable contempt. If you will see it, follow
194: me.
195: SIR TOBY BELCH: To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!
ACT 3 SCENE 1

1: VIOLA: Save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live by
2: thy tabour?
3: Clown: No, sir, I live by the church.
4: VIOLA: Art thou a churchman?
5: Clown: No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for
6: I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by
7: the church.
8: VIOLA: So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a
9: beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy
10: tabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.
11: Clown: You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is
12: but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the
13: wrong side may be turned outward!
14: VIOLA: Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with
15: words may quickly make them wanton.
16: Clown: I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.
17: VIOLA: Why, man?
18: Clown: Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that
19: word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words
20: are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.
21: VIOLA: Thy reason, man?
22: Clown: Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words; and
23: words are grown so false, I am loath to prove
24: reason with them.
25: VIOLA: I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.
26: Clown: Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in my
27: conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be
28: to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.
29: VIOLA: Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?
30: Clown: No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she
31: will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and
32: fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to
33: herrings; the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not
34: her fool, but her corrupter of words.
35: VIOLA: I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.
36: Clown: Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,
37: it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but
38: the fool should be as oft with your master as with
39: my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.
40: VIOLA: Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.
41: Hold, there's expenses for thee.
42: Clown: Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!
43: VIOLA: By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for
44: one;
45: though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy
46: lady within?
47: Clown: Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?
48: VIOLA: Yes, being kept together and put to use.
49: Clown: I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring
50: a Cressida to this Troilus.
51: VIOLA: I understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.
52: Clown: The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but
53: a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is
54: within, sir. I will construe to them whence you
55: come; who you are and what you would are out of my
56: welkin, I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.
57: VIOLA: This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;
58: And to do that well craves a kind of wit:
59: He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
60: The quality of persons, and the time,
61: And, like the haggard, cheque at every feather
62: That comes before his eye. This is a practise
63: As full of labour as a wise man's art
64: For folly that he wisely shows is fit;
65: But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.
66: SIR TOBY BELCH: Save you, gentleman.
67: VIOLA: And you, sir.
68: SIR ANDREW: Dieu vous garde, monsieur.
69: VIOLA: Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.
70: SIR ANDREW: I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.
71: SIR TOBY BELCH: Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous
72: you should enter, if your trade be to her.
73: VIOLA: I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the
74: list of my voyage.
75: SIR TOBY BELCH: Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.
76: VIOLA: My legs do better understand me, sir, than I
77: understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.
78: SIR TOBY BELCH: I mean, to go, sir, to enter.
79: VIOLA: I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we
80: are prevented.
81: Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain
82: odours on you!
83: SIR ANDREW: That youth's a rare courtier: 'Rain odours;' well.
84: VIOLA: My matter hath no voice, to your own most pregnant
85: and vouchsafed ear.
86: SIR ANDREW: 'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:' I'll get 'em
87: all three all ready.
88: OLIVIA: Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.
89: Give me your hand, sir.
90: VIOLA: My duty, madam, and most humble service.
91: OLIVIA: What is your name?
92: VIOLA: Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.
93: OLIVIA: My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world
94: Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:
95: You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.
96: VIOLA: And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:
97: Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.
98: OLIVIA: For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,
99: Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!
100: VIOLA: Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts
101: On his behalf.
102: OLIVIA: O, by your leave, I pray you,
103: I bade you never speak again of him:
104: But, would you undertake another suit,
105: I had rather hear you to solicit that
106: Than music from the spheres.
107: VIOLA: Dear lady,--
108: OLIVIA: Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,
109: After the last enchantment you did here,
110: A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse
111: Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:
112: Under your hard construction must I sit,
113: To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,
114: Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?
115: Have you not set mine honour at the stake
116: And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
117: That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving
118: Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,
119: Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.
120: VIOLA: I pity you.
121: OLIVIA: That's a degree to love.
122: VIOLA: No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof,
123: That very oft we pity enemies.
124: OLIVIA: Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.
125: O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
126: If one should be a prey, how much the better
127: To fall before the lion than the wolf!
128: The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
129: Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:
130: And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,
131: Your were is alike to reap a proper man:
132: There lies your way, due west.
133: VIOLA: Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition
134: Attend your ladyship!
135: You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?
136: OLIVIA: Stay:
137: I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.
138: VIOLA: That you do think you are not what you are.
139: OLIVIA: If I think so, I think the same of you.
140: VIOLA: Then think you right: I am not what I am.
141: OLIVIA: I would you were as I would have you be!
142: VIOLA: Would it be better, madam, than I am?
143: I wish it might, for now I am your fool.
144: OLIVIA: O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
145: In the contempt and anger of his lip!
146: A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
147: Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.
148: Cesario, by the roses of the spring,
149: By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,
150: I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,
151: Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
152: Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
153: For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,
154: But rather reason thus with reason fetter,
155: Love sought is good, but given unsought better.
156: VIOLA: By innocence I swear, and by my youth
157: I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,
158: And that no woman has; nor never none
159: Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.
160: And so adieu, good madam: never more
161: Will I my master's tears to you deplore.
162: OLIVIA: Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
163: That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.
ACT 3 SCENE 2

1: SIR ANDREW: No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.
2: SIR TOBY BELCH: Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.
3: FABIAN: You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.
4: SIR ANDREW: Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the
5: count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me;
6: I saw't i' the orchard.
7: SIR TOBY BELCH: Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.
8: SIR ANDREW: As plain as I see you now.
9: FABIAN: This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
10: SIR ANDREW: 'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?
11: FABIAN: I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of
12: judgment and reason.
13: SIR TOBY BELCH: And they have been grand-jury-men since before Noah
14: was a sailor.
15: FABIAN: She did show favour to the youth in your sight only
16: to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to
17: put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.
18: You should then have accosted her; and with some
19: excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should
20: have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
21: looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the
22: double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash
23: off, and you are now sailed into the north of my
24: lady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicle
25: on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by
26: some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.
27: SIR ANDREW: An't be any way, it must be with valour; for policy
28: I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a
29: politician.
30: SIR TOBY BELCH: Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of
31: valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
32: with him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall
33: take note of it; and assure thyself, there is no
34: love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's
35: commendation with woman than report of valour.
36: FABIAN: There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.
37: SIR ANDREW: Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
38: SIR TOBY BELCH: Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief;
39: it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and fun
40: of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:
41: if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be
42: amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of
43: paper, although the sheet were big enough for the
44: bed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it.
45: Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou
46: write with a goose-pen, no matter: about it.
47: SIR ANDREW: Where shall I find you?
48: SIR TOBY BELCH: We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.
49: FABIAN: This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.
50: SIR TOBY BELCH: I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand
51: strong, or so.
52: FABIAN: We shall have a rare letter from him: but you'll
53: not deliver't?
54: SIR TOBY BELCH: Never trust me, then; and by all means stir on the
55: youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes
56: cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were
57: opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as
58: will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of
59: the anatomy.
60: FABIAN: And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no
61: great presage of cruelty.
62: SIR TOBY BELCH: Look, where the youngest wren of nine comes.
63: MARIA: If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself
64: into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is
65: turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no
66: Christian, that means to be saved by believing
67: rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages
68: of grossness. He's in yellow stockings.
69: SIR TOBY BELCH: And cross-gartered?
70: MARIA: Most villanously; like a pedant that keeps a school
71: i' the church. I have dogged him, like his
72: murderer. He does obey every point of the letter
73: that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his
74: face into more lines than is in the new map with the
75: augmentation of the Indies: you have not seen such
76: a thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things
77: at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do,
78: he'll smile and take't for a great favour.
79: SIR TOBY BELCH: Come, bring us, bring us where he is.
ACT 3 SCENE 3

1: SEBASTIAN: I would not by my will have troubled you;
2: But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,
3: I will no further chide you.
4: ANTONIO: I could not stay behind you: my desire,
5: More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;
6: And not all love to see you, though so much
7: As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,
8: But jealousy what might befall your travel,
9: Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,
10: Unguided and unfriended, often prove
11: Rough and unhospitable: my willing love,
12: The rather by these arguments of fear,
13: Set forth in your pursuit.
14: SEBASTIAN: My kind Antonio,
15: I can no other answer make but thanks,
16: And thanks; and ever [ ] oft good turns
17: Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:
18: But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,
19: You should find better dealing. What's to do?
20: Shall we go see the reliques of this town?
21: ANTONIO: To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.
22: SEBASTIAN: I am not weary, and 'tis long to night:
23: I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes
24: With the memorials and the things of fame
25: That do renown this city.
26: ANTONIO: Would you'ld pardon me;
27: I do not without danger walk these streets:
28: Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleys
29: I did some service; of such note indeed,
30: That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.
31: SEBASTIAN: Belike you slew great number of his people.
32: ANTONIO: The offence is not of such a bloody nature;
33: Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
34: Might well have given us bloody argument.
35: It might have since been answer'd in repaying
36: What we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,
37: Most of our city did: only myself stood out;
38: For which, if I be lapsed in this place,
39: I shall pay dear.
40: SEBASTIAN: Do not then walk too open.
41: ANTONIO: It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse.
42: In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,
43: Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,
44: Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
45: With viewing of the town: there shall you have me.
46: SEBASTIAN: Why I your purse?
47: ANTONIO: Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
48: You have desire to purchase; and your store,
49: I think, is not for idle markets, sir.
50: SEBASTIAN: I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you
51: For an hour.
52: ANTONIO: To the Elephant.
53: SEBASTIAN: I do remember.
ACT 3 SCENE 4

1: OLIVIA: I have sent after him: he says he'll come;
2: How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?
3: For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.
4: I speak too loud.
5: Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,
6: And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:
7: Where is Malvolio?
8: MARIA: He's coming, madam; but in very strange manner. He
9: is, sure, possessed, madam.
10: OLIVIA: Why, what's the matter? does he rave?
11: MARIA: No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your
12: ladyship were best to have some guard about you, if
13: he come; for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits.
14: OLIVIA: Go call him hither.
15: I am as mad as he,
16: If sad and merry madness equal be.
17: How now, Malvolio!
18: MALVOLIO: Sweet lady, ho, ho.
19: OLIVIA: Smilest thou?
20: I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.
21: MALVOLIO: Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some
22: obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; but
23: what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is
24: with me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, and
25: please all.'
26: OLIVIA: Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?
27: MALVOLIO: Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It
28: did come to his hands, and commands shall be
29: executed: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.
30: OLIVIA: Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?
31: MALVOLIO: To bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee.
32: OLIVIA: God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss
33: thy hand so oft?
34: MARIA: How do you, Malvolio?
35: MALVOLIO: At your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.
36: MARIA: Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?
37: MALVOLIO: 'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.
38: OLIVIA: What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?
39: MALVOLIO: 'Some are born great,'--
40: OLIVIA: Ha!
41: MALVOLIO: 'Some achieve greatness,'--
42: OLIVIA: What sayest thou?
43: MALVOLIO: 'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'
44: OLIVIA: Heaven restore thee!
45: MALVOLIO: 'Remember who commended thy yellow stocking s,'--
46: OLIVIA: Thy yellow stockings!
47: MALVOLIO: 'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'
48: OLIVIA: Cross-gartered!
49: MALVOLIO: 'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so;'--
50: OLIVIA: Am I made?
51: MALVOLIO: 'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'
52: OLIVIA: Why, this is very midsummer madness.
53: Servant: Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is
54: returned: I could hardly entreat him back: he
55: attends your ladyship's pleasure.
56: OLIVIA: I'll come to him.
57: Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's
58: my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special
59: care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the
60: half of my dowry.
61: MALVOLIO: O, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than
62: Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with
63: the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may
64: appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that
65: in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;
66: 'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;
67: let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put
68: thyself into the trick of singularity;' and
69: consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad
70: face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the
71: habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have
72: limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me
73: thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this
74: fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor
75: after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing
76: adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no
77: scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous
78: or unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothing
79: that can be can come between me and the full
80: prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the
81: doer of this, and he is to be thanked.
82: SIR TOBY BELCH: Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all
83: the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion
84: himself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him.
85: FABIAN: Here he is, here he is. How is't with you, sir?
86: how is't with you, man?
87: MALVOLIO: Go off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private: go
88: off.
89: MARIA: Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not
90: I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a
91: care of him.
92: MALVOLIO: Ah, ha! does she so?
93: SIR TOBY BELCH: Go to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gently
94: with him: let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? how
95: is't with you? What, man! defy the devil:
96: consider, he's an enemy to mankind.
97: MALVOLIO: Do you know what you say?
98: MARIA: La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes
99: it at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!
100: FABIAN: Carry his water to the wise woman.
101: MARIA: Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I
102: live. My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.
103: MALVOLIO: How now, mistress!
104: MARIA: O Lord!
105: SIR TOBY BELCH: Prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: do
106: you not see you move him? let me alone with him.
107: FABIAN: No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is
108: rough, and will not be roughly used.
109: SIR TOBY BELCH: Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?
110: MALVOLIO: Sir!
111: SIR TOBY BELCH: Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man! 'tis not for
112: gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan: hang
113: him, foul collier!
114: MARIA: Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.
115: MALVOLIO: My prayers, minx!
116: MARIA: No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.
117: MALVOLIO: Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow
118: things: I am not of your element: you shall know
119: more hereafter.
120: SIR TOBY BELCH: Is't possible?
121: FABIAN: If this were played upon a stage now, I could
122: condemn it as an improbable fiction.
123: SIR TOBY BELCH: His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.
124: MARIA: Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.
125: FABIAN: Why, we shall make him mad indeed.
126: MARIA: The house will be the quieter.
127: SIR TOBY BELCH: Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound. My
128: niece is already in the belief that he's mad: we
129: may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance,
130: till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt
131: us to have mercy on him: at which time we will
132: bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a
133: finder of madmen. But see, but see.
134: FABIAN: More matter for a May morning.
135: SIR ANDREW: Here's the challenge, read it: warrant there's
136: vinegar and pepper in't.
137: FABIAN: Is't so saucy?
138: SIR ANDREW: Ay, is't, I warrant him: do but read.
139: SIR TOBY BELCH: Give me.
140: 'Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.'
141: FABIAN: Good, and valiant.
142: SIR TOBY BELCH: [Reads] 'Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind,
143: why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for't.'
144: FABIAN: A good note; that keeps you from the blow of the law.
145: SIR TOBY BELCH: [Reads] 'Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in my
146: sight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy
147: throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for.'
148: FABIAN: Very brief, and to exceeding good sense--less.
149: SIR TOBY BELCH: [Reads] 'I will waylay thee going home; where if it
150: be thy chance to kill me,'--
151: FABIAN: Good.
152: SIR TOBY BELCH: [Reads] 'Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.'
153: FABIAN: Still you keep o' the windy side of the law: good.
154: SIR TOBY BELCH: [Reads] 'Fare thee well; and God have mercy upon
155: one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine; but
156: my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy
157: friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,
158: ANDREW AGUECHEEK.
159: If this letter move him not, his legs cannot:
160: I'll give't him.
161: MARIA: You may have very fit occasion for't: he is now in
162: some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.
163: SIR TOBY BELCH: Go, Sir Andrew: scout me for him at the corner the
164: orchard like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seest
165: him, draw; and, as thou drawest swear horrible; for
166: it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a
167: swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood
168: more approbation than ever proof itself would have
169: earned him. Away!
170: SIR ANDREW: Nay, let me alone for swearing.
171: SIR TOBY BELCH: Now will not I deliver his letter: for the behavior
172: of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good
173: capacity and breeding; his employment between his
174: lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this
175: letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no
176: terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a
177: clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by
178: word of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable report
179: of valour; and drive the gentleman, as I know his
180: youth will aptly receive it, into a most hideous
181: opinion of his rage, skill, fury and impetuosity.
182: This will so fright them both that they will kill
183: one another by the look, like cockatrices.
184: FABIAN: Here he comes with your niece: give them way till
185: he take leave, and presently after him.
186: SIR TOBY BELCH: I will meditate the while upon some horrid message
187: for a challenge.
188: OLIVIA: I have said too much unto a heart of stone
189: And laid mine honour too unchary out:
190: There's something in me that reproves my fault;
191: But such a headstrong potent fault it is,
192: That it but mocks reproof.
193: VIOLA: With the same 'havior that your passion bears
194: Goes on my master's grief.
195: OLIVIA: Here, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture;
196: Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;
197: And I beseech you come again to-morrow.
198: What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,
199: That honour saved may upon asking give?
200: VIOLA: Nothing but this; your true love for my master.
201: OLIVIA: How with mine honour may I give him that
202: Which I have given to you?
203: VIOLA: I will acquit you.
204: OLIVIA: Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well:
205: A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.
206: SIR TOBY BELCH: Gentleman, God save thee.
207: VIOLA: And you, sir.
208: SIR TOBY BELCH: That defence thou hast, betake thee to't: of what
209: nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know
210: not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as
211: the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end:
212: dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for
213: thy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.
214: VIOLA: You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel
215: to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from
216: any image of offence done to any man.
217: SIR TOBY BELCH: You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore,
218: if you hold your life at any price, betake you to
219: your guard; for your opposite hath in him what
220: youth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.
221: VIOLA: I pray you, sir, what is he?
222: SIR TOBY BELCH: He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on
223: carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private
224: brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; and
225: his incensement at this moment is so implacable,
226: that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death
227: and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.
228: VIOLA: I will return again into the house and desire some
229: conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard
230: of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on
231: others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man
232: of that quirk.
233: SIR TOBY BELCH: Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a
234: very competent injury: therefore, get you on and
235: give him his desire. Back you shall not to the
236: house, unless you undertake that with me which with
237: as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,
238: or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you
239: must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.
240: VIOLA: This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me
241: this courteous office, as to know of the knight what
242: my offence to him is: it is something of my
243: negligence, nothing of my purpose.
244: SIR TOBY BELCH: I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this
245: gentleman till my return.
246: VIOLA: Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?
247: FABIAN: I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a
248: mortal arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.
249: VIOLA: I beseech you, what manner of man is he?
250: FABIAN: Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by
251: his form, as you are like to find him in the proof
252: of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,
253: bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly
254: have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk
255: towards him? I will make your peace with him if I
256: can.
257: VIOLA: I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that
258: had rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I
259: care not who knows so much of my mettle.
260: SIR TOBY BELCH: Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a
261: firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and
262: all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal
263: motion, that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he
264: pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they
265: step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.
266: SIR ANDREW: Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.
267: SIR TOBY BELCH: Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can
268: scarce hold him yonder.
269: SIR ANDREW: Plague on't, an I thought he had been valiant and so
270: cunning in fence, I'ld have seen him damned ere I'ld
271: have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip,
272: and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.
273: SIR TOBY BELCH: I'll make the motion: stand here, make a good show
274: on't: this shall end without the perdition of souls.
275: Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.
276: I have his horse to take up the quarrel:
277: I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.
278: FABIAN: He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and
279: looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.
280: SIR TOBY BELCH: [To VIOLA] There's no remedy, sir; he will fight
281: with you for's oath sake: marry, he hath better
282: bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now
283: scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw, for
284: the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.
285: VIOLA: [Aside] Pray God defend me! A little thing would
286: make me tell them how much I lack of a man.
287: FABIAN: Give ground, if you see him furious.
288: SIR TOBY BELCH: Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentleman
289: will, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you;
290: he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he has
291: promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he
292: will not hurt you. Come on; to't.
293: SIR ANDREW: Pray God, he keep his oath!
294: VIOLA: I do assure you, 'tis against my will.
295: ANTONIO: Put up your sword. If this young gentleman
296: Have done offence, I take the fault on me:
297: If you offend him, I for him defy you.
298: SIR TOBY BELCH: You, sir! why, what are you?
299: ANTONIO: One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more
300: Than you have heard him brag to you he will.
301: SIR TOBY BELCH: Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.
302: FABIAN: O good Sir Toby, hold! here come the officers.
303: SIR TOBY BELCH: I'll be with you anon.
304: VIOLA: Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.
305: SIR ANDREW: Marry, will I, sir; and, for that I promised you,
306: I'll be as good as my word: he will bear you easily
307: and reins well.
308: First Officer: This is the man; do thy office.
309: Second Officer: Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.
310: ANTONIO: You do mistake me, sir.
311: First Officer: No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,
312: Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.
313: Take him away: he knows I know him well.
314: ANTONIO: I must obey.
315: This comes with seeking you:
316: But there's no remedy; I shall answer it.
317: What will you do, now my necessity
318: Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me
319: Much more for what I cannot do for you
320: Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;
321: But be of comfort.
322: Second Officer: Come, sir, away.
323: ANTONIO: I must entreat of you some of that money.
324: VIOLA: What money, sir?
325: For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,
326: And, part, being prompted by your present trouble,
327: Out of my lean and low ability
328: I'll lend you something: my having is not much;
329: I'll make division of my present with you:
330: Hold, there's half my coffer.
331: ANTONIO: Will you deny me now?
332: Is't possible that my deserts to you
333: Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,
334: Lest that it make me so unsound a man
335: As to upbraid you with those kindnesses
336: That I have done for you.
337: VIOLA: I know of none;
338: Nor know I you by voice or any feature:
339: I hate ingratitude more in a man
340: Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,
341: Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
342: Inhabits our frail blood.
343: ANTONIO: O heavens themselves!
344: Second Officer: Come, sir, I pray you, go.
345: ANTONIO: Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here
346: I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,
347: Relieved him with such sanctity of love,
348: And to his image, which methought did promise
349: Most venerable worth, did I devotion.
350: First Officer: What's that to us? The time goes by: away!
351: ANTONIO: But O how vile an idol proves this god
352: Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.
353: In nature there's no blemish but the mind;
354: None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
355: Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil
356: Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.
357: First Officer: The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir.
358: ANTONIO: Lead me on.
359: VIOLA: Methinks his words do from such passion fly,
360: That he believes himself: so do not I.
361: Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,
362: That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!
363: SIR TOBY BELCH: Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian: we'll
364: whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.
365: VIOLA: He named Sebastian: I my brother know
366: Yet living in my glass; even such and so
367: In favour was my brother, and he went
368: Still in this fashion, colour, ornament,
369: For him I imitate: O, if it prove,
370: Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.
371: SIR TOBY BELCH: A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than
372: a hare: his dishonesty appears in leaving his
373: friend here in necessity and denying him; and for
374: his cowardship, ask Fabian.
375: FABIAN: A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.
376: SIR ANDREW: 'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him.
377: SIR TOBY BELCH: Do; cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.
378: SIR ANDREW: An I do not,--
379: FABIAN: Come, let's see the event.
ACT 4 SCENE 1

1: Clown: Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?
2: SEBASTIAN: Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow:
3: Let me be clear of thee.
4: Clown: Well held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you; nor
5: I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come
6: speak with her; nor your name is not Master Cesario;
7: nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so.
8: SEBASTIAN: I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else: Thou
9: know'st not me.
10: Clown: Vent my folly! he has heard that word of some
11: great man and now applies it to a fool. Vent my
12: folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world,
13: will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy
14: strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my
15: lady: shall I vent to her that thou art coming?
16: SEBASTIAN: I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me: There's
17: money for thee: if you tarry longer, I shall give
18: worse payment.
19: Clown: By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men
20: that give fools money get themselves a good
21: report--after fourteen years' purchase.
22: SIR ANDREW: Now, sir, have I met you again? there's for you.
23: SEBASTIAN: Why, there's for thee, and there, and there. Are all
24: the people mad?
25: SIR TOBY BELCH: Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house.
26: Clown: This will I tell my lady straight: I would not be
27: in some of your coats for two pence.
28: SIR TOBY BELCH: Come on, sir; hold.
29: SIR ANDREW: Nay, let him alone: I'll go another way to work
30: with him; I'll have an action of battery against
31: him, if there be any law in Illyria: though I
32: struck him first, yet it's no matter for that.
33: SEBASTIAN: Let go thy hand.
34: SIR TOBY BELCH: Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young
35: soldier, put up your iron: you are well fleshed; come on.
36: SEBASTIAN: I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now? If
37: thou darest tempt me further, draw thy sword.
38: SIR TOBY BELCH: What, what? Nay, then I must have an ounce or two
39: of this malapert blood from you.
40: OLIVIA: Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!
41: SIR TOBY BELCH: Madam!
42: OLIVIA: Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,
43: Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,
44: Where manners ne'er were preach'd! out of my sight!
45: Be not offended, dear Cesario.
46: Rudesby, be gone!
47: I prithee, gentle friend,
48: Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway
49: In this uncivil and thou unjust extent
50: Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,
51: And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
52: This ruffian hath botch'd up, that thou thereby
53: Mayst smile at this: thou shalt not choose but go:
54: Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,
55: He started one poor heart of mine in thee.
56: SEBASTIAN: What relish is in this? how runs the stream?
57: Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:
58: Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;
59: If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!
60: OLIVIA: Nay, come, I prithee; would thou'ldst be ruled by me!
61: SEBASTIAN: Madam, I will.
62: OLIVIA: O, say so, and so be!
ACT 4 SCENE 2

1: MARIA: Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard;
2: make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate: do
3: it quickly; I'll call Sir Toby the whilst.
4: Clown: Well, I'll put it on, and I will dissemble myself
5: in't; and I would I were the first that ever
6: dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall enough to
7: become the function well, nor lean enough to be
8: thought a good student; but to be said an honest man
9: and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a
10: careful man and a great scholar. The competitors enter.
11: SIR TOBY BELCH: Jove bless thee, master Parson.
12: Clown: Bonos dies, Sir Toby: for, as the old hermit of
13: Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily
14: said to a niece of King Gorboduc, 'That that is is;'
15: so I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson; for,
16: what is 'that' but 'that,' and 'is' but 'is'?
17: SIR TOBY BELCH: To him, Sir Topas.
18: Clown: What, ho, I say! peace in this prison!
19: SIR TOBY BELCH: The knave counterfeits well; a good knave.
20: MALVOLIO: [Within] Who calls there?
21: Clown: Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio
22: the lunatic.
23: MALVOLIO: Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.
24: Clown: Out, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man!
25: talkest thou nothing but of ladies?
26: SIR TOBY BELCH: Well said, Master Parson.
27: MALVOLIO: Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged: good Sir
28: Topas, do not think I am mad: they have laid me
29: here in hideous darkness.
30: Clown: Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most
31: modest terms; for I am one of those gentle ones
32: that will use the devil himself with courtesy:
33: sayest thou that house is dark?
34: MALVOLIO: As hell, Sir Topas.
35: Clown: Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes,
36: and the clearstores toward the south north are as
37: lustrous as ebony; and yet complainest thou of
38: obstruction?
39: MALVOLIO: I am not mad, Sir Topas: I say to you, this house is dark.
40: Clown: Madman, thou errest: I say, there is no darkness
41: but ignorance; in which thou art more puzzled than
42: the Egyptians in their fog.
43: MALVOLIO: I say, this house is as dark as ignorance, though
44: ignorance were as dark as hell; and I say, there
45: was never man thus abused. I am no more mad than you
46: are: make the trial of it in any constant question.
47: Clown: What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl?
48: MALVOLIO: That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.
49: Clown: What thinkest thou of his opinion?
50: MALVOLIO: I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.
51: Clown: Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness:
52: thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will
53: allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock, lest
54: thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.
55: MALVOLIO: Sir Topas, Sir Topas!
56: SIR TOBY BELCH: My most exquisite Sir Topas!
57: Clown: Nay, I am for all waters.
58: MARIA: Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and
59: gown: he sees thee not.
60: SIR TOBY BELCH: To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how
61: thou findest him: I would we were well rid of this
62: knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered, I
63: would he were, for I am now so far in offence with
64: my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this
65: sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.
66: Clown: [Singing]
67: 'Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,
68: Tell me how thy lady does.'
69: MALVOLIO: Fool!
70: Clown: 'My lady is unkind, perdy.'
71: MALVOLIO: Fool!
72: Clown: 'Alas, why is she so?'
73: MALVOLIO: Fool, I say!
74: Clown: 'She loves another'--Who calls, ha?
75: MALVOLIO: Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my
76: hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink and paper:
77: as I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to
78: thee for't.
79: Clown: Master Malvolio?
80: MALVOLIO: Ay, good fool.
81: Clown: Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?
82: MALVOLIO: Fool, there was never a man so notoriously abused: I
83: am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.
84: Clown: But as well? then you are mad indeed, if you be no
85: better in your wits than a fool.
86: MALVOLIO: They have here propertied me; keep me in darkness,
87: send ministers to me, asses, and do all they can to
88: face me out of my wits.
89: Clown: Advise you what you say; the minister is here.
90: Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore!
91: endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain
92: bibble babble.
93: MALVOLIO: Sir Topas!
94: Clown: Maintain no words with him, good fellow. Who, I,
95: sir? not I, sir. God be wi' you, good Sir Topas.
96: Merry, amen. I will, sir, I will.
97: MALVOLIO: Fool, fool, fool, I say!
98: Clown: Alas, sir, be patient. What say you sir? I am
99: shent for speaking to you.
100: MALVOLIO: Good fool, help me to some light and some paper: I
101: tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.
102: Clown: Well-a-day that you were, sir
103: MALVOLIO: By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper and
104: light; and convey what I will set down to my lady:
105: it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing
106: of letter did.
107: Clown: I will help you to't. But tell me true, are you
108: not mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit?
109: MALVOLIO: Believe me, I am not; I tell thee true.
110: Clown: Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his
111: brains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink.
112: MALVOLIO: Fool, I'll requite it in the highest degree: I
113: prithee, be gone.
114: Clown: [Singing]
115: I am gone, sir,
116: And anon, sir,
117: I'll be with you again,
118: In a trice,
119: Like to the old Vice,
120: Your need to sustain;
121: Who, with dagger of lath,
122: In his rage and his wrath,
123: Cries, ah, ha! to the devil:
124: Like a mad lad,
125: Pare thy nails, dad;
126: Adieu, good man devil.
ACT 4 SCENE 3

1: SEBASTIAN: This is the air; that is the glorious sun;
2: This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't;
3: And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
4: Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?
5: I could not find him at the Elephant:
6: Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,
7: That he did range the town to seek me out.
8: His counsel now might do me golden service;
9: For though my soul disputes well with my sense,
10: That this may be some error, but no madness,
11: Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
12: So far exceed all instance, all discourse,
13: That I am ready to distrust mine eyes
14: And wrangle with my reason that persuades me
15: To any other trust but that I am mad
16: Or else the lady's mad; yet, if 'twere so,
17: She could not sway her house, command her followers,
18: Take and give back affairs and their dispatch
19: With such a smooth, discreet and stable bearing
20: As I perceive she does: there's something in't
21: That is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.
22: OLIVIA: Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,
23: Now go with me and with this holy man
24: Into the chantry by: there, before him,
25: And underneath that consecrated roof,
26: Plight me the full assurance of your faith;
27: That my most jealous and too doubtful soul
28: May live at peace. He shall conceal it
29: Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,
30: What time we will our celebration keep
31: According to my birth. What do you say?
32: SEBASTIAN: I'll follow this good man, and go with you;
33: And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.
ACT 5 SCENE 1

1: FABIAN: Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.
2: Clown: Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.
3: FABIAN: Any thing.
4: Clown: Do not desire to see this letter.
5: FABIAN: This is, to give a dog, and in recompense desire my
6: dog again.
7: DUKE ORSINO: Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?
8: Clown: Ay, sir; we are some of her trappings.
9: DUKE ORSINO: I know thee well; how dost thou, my good fellow?
10: Clown: Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse
11: for my friends.
12: DUKE ORSINO: Just the contrary; the better for thy friends.
13: Clown: No, sir, the worse.
14: DUKE ORSINO: How can that be?
15: Clown: Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me;
16: now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by
17: my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself,
18: and by my friends, I am abused: so that,
19: conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives
20: make your two affirmatives why then, the worse for
21: my friends and the better for my foes.
22: DUKE ORSINO: Why, this is excellent.
23: Clown: By my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be
24: one of my friends.
25: DUKE ORSINO: Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.
26: Clown: But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would
27: you could make it another.
28: DUKE ORSINO: O, you give me ill counsel.
29: Clown: Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once,
30: and let your flesh and blood obey it.
31: DUKE ORSINO: Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a
32: double-dealer: there's another.
33: Clown: Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play; and the old
34: saying is, the third pays for all: the triplex,
35: sir, is a good tripping measure; or the bells of
36: Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind; one, two, three.
37: DUKE ORSINO: You can fool no more money out of me at this throw:
38: if you will let your lady know I am here to speak
39: with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake
40: my bounty further.
41: Clown: Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come
42: again. I go, sir; but I would not have you to think
43: that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness:
44: but, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I
45: will awake it anon.
46: VIOLA: Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.
47: DUKE ORSINO: That face of his I do remember well;
48: Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd
49: As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:
50: A bawbling vessel was he captain of,
51: For shallow draught and bulk unprizable;
52: With which such scathful grapple did he make
53: With the most noble bottom of our fleet,
54: That very envy and the tongue of loss
55: Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?
56: First Officer: Orsino, this is that Antonio
57: That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy;
58: And this is he that did the Tiger board,
59: When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:
60: Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,
61: In private brabble did we apprehend him.
62: VIOLA: He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side;
63: But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:
64: I know not what 'twas but distraction.
65: DUKE ORSINO: Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
66: What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,
67: Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,
68: Hast made thine enemies?
69: ANTONIO: Orsino, noble sir,
70: Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:
71: Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
72: Though I confess, on base and ground enough,
73: Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
74: That most ingrateful boy there by your side,
75: From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
76: Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:
77: His life I gave him and did thereto add
78: My love, without retention or restraint,
79: All his in dedication; for his sake
80: Did I expose myself, pure for his love,
81: Into the danger of this adverse town;
82: Drew to defend him when he was beset:
83: Where being apprehended, his false cunning,
84: Not meaning to partake with me in danger,
85: Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,
86: And grew a twenty years removed thing
87: While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,
88: Which I had recommended to his use
89: Not half an hour before.
90: VIOLA: How can this be?
91: DUKE ORSINO: When came he to this town?
92: ANTONIO: To-day, my lord; and for three months before,
93: No interim, not a minute's vacancy,
94: Both day and night did we keep company.
95: DUKE ORSINO: Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.
96: But for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are madness:
97: Three months this youth hath tended upon me;
98: But more of that anon. Take him aside.
99: OLIVIA: What would my lord, but that he may not have,
100: Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?
101: Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.
102: VIOLA: Madam!
103: DUKE ORSINO: Gracious Olivia,--
104: OLIVIA: What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,--
105: VIOLA: My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.
106: OLIVIA: If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,
107: It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
108: As howling after music.
109: DUKE ORSINO: Still so cruel?
110: OLIVIA: Still so constant, lord.
111: DUKE ORSINO: What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,
112: To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
113: My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
114: That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?
115: OLIVIA: Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.
116: DUKE ORSINO: Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,
117: Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,
118: Kill what I love?--a savage jealousy
119: That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:
120: Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,
121: And that I partly know the instrument
122: That screws me from my true place in your favour,
123: Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
124: But this your minion, whom I know you love,
125: And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,
126: Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,
127: Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.
128: Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:
129: I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,
130: To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
131: VIOLA: And I, most jocund, apt and willingly,
132: To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.
133: OLIVIA: Where goes Cesario?
134: VIOLA: After him I love
135: More than I love these eyes, more than my life,
136: More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.
137: If I do feign, you witnesses above
138: Punish my life for tainting of my love!
139: OLIVIA: Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!
140: VIOLA: Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?
141: OLIVIA: Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?
142: Call forth the holy father.
143: DUKE ORSINO: Come, away!
144: OLIVIA: Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.
145: DUKE ORSINO: Husband!
146: OLIVIA: Ay, husband: can he that deny?
147: DUKE ORSINO: Her husband, sirrah!
148: VIOLA: No, my lord, not I.
149: OLIVIA: Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear
150: That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
151: Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up;
152: Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art
153: As great as that thou fear'st.
154: O, welcome, father!
155: Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,
156: Here to unfold, though lately we intended
157: To keep in darkness what occasion now
158: Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know
159: Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.
160: Priest: A contract of eternal bond of love,
161: Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands,
162: Attested by the holy close of lips,
163: Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings;
164: And all the ceremony of this compact
165: Seal'd in my function, by my testimony:
166: Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave
167: I have travell'd but two hours.
168: DUKE ORSINO: O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be
169: When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?
170: Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,
171: That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
172: Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet
173: Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.
174: VIOLA: My lord, I do protest--
175: OLIVIA: O, do not swear!
176: Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.
177: SIR ANDREW: For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently
178: to Sir Toby.
179: OLIVIA: What's the matter?
180: SIR ANDREW: He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby
181: a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, your
182: help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.
183: OLIVIA: Who has done this, Sir Andrew?
184: SIR ANDREW: The count's gentleman, one Cesario: we took him for
185: a coward, but he's the very devil incardinate.
186: DUKE ORSINO: My gentleman, Cesario?
187: SIR ANDREW: 'Od's lifelings, here he is! You broke my head for
188: nothing; and that that I did, I was set on to do't
189: by Sir Toby.
190: VIOLA: Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:
191: You drew your sword upon me without cause;
192: But I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.
193: SIR ANDREW: If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: I
194: think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.
195: Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more:
196: but if he had not been in drink, he would have
197: tickled you othergates than he did.
198: DUKE ORSINO: How now, gentleman! how is't with you?
199: SIR TOBY BELCH: That's all one: has hurt me, and there's the end
200: on't. Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?
201: Clown: O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes
202: were set at eight i' the morning.
203: SIR TOBY BELCH: Then he's a rogue, and a passy measures panyn: I
204: hate a drunken rogue.
205: OLIVIA: Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?
206: SIR ANDREW: I'll help you, Sir Toby, because well be dressed together.
207: SIR TOBY BELCH: Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and a
208: knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!
209: OLIVIA: Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to.
210: SEBASTIAN: I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman:
211: But, had it been the brother of my blood,
212: I must have done no less with wit and safety.
213: You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that
214: I do perceive it hath offended you:
215: Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
216: We made each other but so late ago.
217: DUKE ORSINO: One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,
218: A natural perspective, that is and is not!
219: SEBASTIAN: Antonio, O my dear Antonio!
220: How have the hours rack'd and tortured me,
221: Since I have lost thee!
222: ANTONIO: Sebastian are you?
223: SEBASTIAN: Fear'st thou that, Antonio?
224: ANTONIO: How have you made division of yourself?
225: An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin
226: Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
227: OLIVIA: Most wonderful!
228: SEBASTIAN: Do I stand there? I never had a brother;
229: Nor can there be that deity in my nature,
230: Of here and every where. I had a sister,
231: Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.
232: Of charity, what kin are you to me?
233: What countryman? what name? what parentage?
234: VIOLA: Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;
235: Such a Sebastian was my brother too,
236: So went he suited to his watery tomb:
237: If spirits can assume both form and suit
238: You come to fright us.
239: SEBASTIAN: A spirit I am indeed;
240: But am in that dimension grossly clad
241: Which from the womb I did participate.
242: Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,
243: I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,
244: And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'
245: VIOLA: My father had a mole upon his brow.
246: SEBASTIAN: And so had mine.
247: VIOLA: And died that day when Viola from her birth
248: Had number'd thirteen years.
249: SEBASTIAN: O, that record is lively in my soul!
250: He finished indeed his mortal act
251: That day that made my sister thirteen years.
252: VIOLA: If nothing lets to make us happy both
253: But this my masculine usurp'd attire,
254: Do not embrace me till each circumstance
255: Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump
256: That I am Viola: which to confirm,
257: I'll bring you to a captain in this town,
258: Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help
259: I was preserved to serve this noble count.
260: All the occurrence of my fortune since
261: Hath been between this lady and this lord.
262: SEBASTIAN: [To OLIVIA] So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:
263: But nature to her bias drew in that.
264: You would have been contracted to a maid;
265: Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
266: You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.
267: DUKE ORSINO: Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.
268: If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,
269: I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
270: Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times
271: Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
272: VIOLA: And all those sayings will I overswear;
273: And those swearings keep as true in soul
274: As doth that orbed continent the fire
275: That severs day from night.
276: DUKE ORSINO: Give me thy hand;
277: And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.
278: VIOLA: The captain that did bring me first on shore
279: Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action
280: Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,
281: A gentleman, and follower of my lady's.
282: OLIVIA: He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:
283: And yet, alas, now I remember me,
284: They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.
285: A most extracting frenzy of mine own
286: From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.
287: How does he, sirrah?
288: Clown: Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves's end as
289: well as a man in his case may do: has here writ a
290: letter to you; I should have given't you to-day
291: morning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,
292: so it skills not much when they are delivered.
293: OLIVIA: Open't, and read it.
294: Clown: Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers
295: the madman.
296: 'By the Lord, madam,'--
297: OLIVIA: How now! art thou mad?
298: Clown: No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship
299: will have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox.
300: OLIVIA: Prithee, read i' thy right wits.
301: Clown: So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to
302: read thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.
303: OLIVIA: Read it you, sirrah.
304: FABIAN: [Reads] 'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the
305: world shall know it: though you have put me into
306: darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
307: me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as
308: your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced
309: me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt
310: not but to do myself much right, or you much shame.
311: Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little
312: unthought of and speak out of my injury.
313: THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.'
314: OLIVIA: Did he write this?
315: Clown: Ay, madam.
316: DUKE ORSINO: This savours not much of distraction.
317: OLIVIA: See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither.
318: My lord so please you, these things further
319: thought on,
320: To think me as well a sister as a wife,
321: One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,
322: Here at my house and at my proper cost.
323: DUKE ORSINO: Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.
324: Your master quits you; and for your service done him,
325: So much against the mettle of your sex,
326: So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,
327: And since you call'd me master for so long,
328: Here is my hand: you shall from this time be
329: Your master's mistress.
330: OLIVIA: A sister! you are she.
331: DUKE ORSINO: Is this the madman?
332: OLIVIA: Ay, my lord, this same.
333: How now, Malvolio!
334: MALVOLIO: Madam, you have done me wrong,
335: Notorious wrong.
336: OLIVIA: Have I, Malvolio? no.
337: MALVOLIO: Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.
338: You must not now deny it is your hand:
339: Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;
340: Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:
341: You can say none of this: well, grant it then
342: And tell me, in the modesty of honour,
343: Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,
344: Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,
345: To put on yellow stockings and to frown
346: Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;
347: And, acting this in an obedient hope,
348: Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,
349: Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,
350: And made the most notorious geck and gull
351: That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.
352: OLIVIA: Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,
353: Though, I confess, much like the character
354: But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.
355: And now I do bethink me, it was she
356: First told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling,
357: And in such forms which here were presupposed
358: Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:
359: This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;
360: But when we know the grounds and authors of it,
361: Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
362: Of thine own cause.
363: FABIAN: Good madam, hear me speak,
364: And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
365: Taint the condition of this present hour,
366: Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,
367: Most freely I confess, myself and Toby
368: Set this device against Malvolio here,
369: Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
370: We had conceived against him: Maria writ
371: The letter at Sir Toby's great importance;
372: In recompense whereof he hath married her.
373: How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,
374: May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;
375: If that the injuries be justly weigh'd
376: That have on both sides pass'd.
377: OLIVIA: Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!
378: Clown: Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,
379: and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I was
380: one, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir; but
381: that's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'
382: But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such
383: a barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:'
384: and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.
385: MALVOLIO: I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.
386: OLIVIA: He hath been most notoriously abused.
387: DUKE ORSINO: Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:
388: He hath not told us of the captain yet:
389: When that is known and golden time convents,
390: A solemn combination shall be made
391: Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,
392: We will not part from hence. Cesario, come;
393: For so you shall be, while you are a man;
394: But when in other habits you are seen,
395: Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.
